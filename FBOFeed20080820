AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utility Privatization Westover ARB, MA Natural Gas Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP is 30 Sep 08. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a brief description of the system to be privatized:

The Westover ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts at the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  There are no items specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization.
Natural gas is supplied to Westover ARB by Bay State Gas through two metering points. One metering point is near the Central Ave. Gate (Building 2765). A second metering point is at the Westover Club. The meters are owned by Bay State Gas. The main distribution system receives gas at approximately 50 pounds per square inch gauge (PSIG). Natural gas is used to meet space and water heating requirements on Base. The natural gas utility system at Westover ARB has no pressure problems during peak winter loads. Bay State Gas maintains odorization at the metering points. 
A study of the capacity of the natural gas system at Westover ARB to support future operations when BRAC related mission additions are complete was finalized in February 2008.  This study concluded that the proposed capital projects represent a potential increase in peak gas flow of about 76 percent compared to the existing theoretical peak flow, and that several modifications were recommended to allow the existing system to accommodate the increased demand.   
The natural gas utility system at Westover ARB consists of polyethylene (PE) pipe that is owned by Westover ARB. Natural gas utility mains and service lines are approximately 3 to 6 feet below grade.   Valves are also made of plastic.  Some of the pipe is buried with marker tape and tracer wire, but a majority of the system does not have marker tape or functioning tracer wire because it was installed using jack and bore techniques.
 The distribution system is looped so that most buildings can be fed from at least two different paths. There are no cathodic protection or odorization facilities at Westover ARB.  A short segment of metal pipe delivers natural gas to the west side of building 3505 on the north side of the base.  This pipe does not have cathodic protection so it is being programmed for replacement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, Boise, Idaho,  is seeking sources to furnish and install manual security barriers at various sites in Idaho.  Currently, Reclamation believes the required barriers are only available from Delta Scientific,  Palmdale, California, and we plan to award a non-competitive contract to Delta Scientific if no other qualified sources are found.  Our requirements for the barriers are:  1)  Must be United States Department of State (DOS) approved and certified; 2) Must be rated/tested/certified at K-12 (15,000 lb vehicle at 50 MPH) K-8 (15,000 lb at 40 MPH) or K-4 (15,000 lb at 30 MPH); 3) Must be designed for shallow depth foundations (typically 36 inches or less in depth); 4) Must be operated manually (no hydraulics or power); and 5) Must have anti-tamper locking mechanism installed with secondary measures to operate the system in the event the locking mechanism fails.  Overall, the barriers must include simplicity of mechanical components with minimal parts, and be constructed of robust components that are capable of with standing various environmental conditions at various Reclamation sites.   We also require the gates to be installed by certified installers from the manufacturer.   The NAICS code for the barriers only is 332323.
This notice not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes that it can meet these specifications may reply to this notice demonstrating your product meets each element of the requirements above. Responses we receive will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within our discretion.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate with only one responsible source, Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc., P.O. Box 451, College Park, Maryland 20740, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures at a firm fixed price, for a two year subscription to LIFT 2085 and a LIFT software license.  Inforum-LIFT is uniquely qualified for three reasons: (1) Through previous work under contract to CMS, the LIFT model has been modified to specifically address OACT requirements.  These modifications include those required to develop long term (75+  year) projections.  The capability to analyze detailed industry behavior over the long term is a capability unique to LIFT.  (2) In addition, the LIFT framework permits the user to replace LIFT equations with user specified equations and/or override the models equations or exogenous assumptions.  CMS has already invested considerable time in learning how to use this capability.  Again, this feature (that is, the ability for the user to override the model equations in the context of a long term projection tool) is a feature that is unique to LIFT.  (3) Inforum economists have worked closely with CMS staff for several years on various long term forecasting projects.  As a result, Inforum economists have a detailed knowledge of CMS programs and projects which would be difficult if not impossible to replace. The Government intends to negotiate with only one responsible source pursuant to the authority of Part 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Therefore, this notice is not a request for a submission.  However, interested parties may submit a description of their capabilities to perform within 5 days of this notice and the submission will be considered.

<DESC>Septic bladder pumping services are to be provided on FEMA-installed travel trailers and mobile homes (temporary housing units (THUs)) at multiple locations within the state of Mississippi.  The estimated number of THUs with bladders is approximately 102.  The rate of decrease in this number will depend on the pace of THU deactivation.  Approximately 28 of the THUs are located in Pearl River and Hancock Counties (Zone 1) and approximately 74 are located in other Mississippi counties (Zone 2).  As part of the pumping service, the THU’s septic bladder is to be “pumped” on a regular basis, an average of 3 times per week.  Offerors may bid on the work for either or both zones.  

The pumping services include the pumping, removal, and proper disposal of solids and liquefied contents from the THU’s septic bladder, along with project management.

The contract base period of performance will be November 1, 2008, through March 31, 2009.  The period of performance may be extended for four (4) additional six (6) month option periods.

The Government intends to award one contract for each zone.  This acquisition is a total small business set-aside to Mississippi vendors, as authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (PL 100-707) of November 1988.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration intends to award a sole source purchase order to Gamma Scientific for upgrades to the agency’s ART-940D auto ranging gonio-photometer.  Gamma Scientific will provide several different components as follows: (1) add a fifth motor to control the deflection rod on the observer angle positioner (OAP).  The fifth motor will be computer-controlled so that as the rail-mounted goniometer is moved relative to the photo-detector, the deflection rod will be adjusted to keep the photo-detector pointing at the center of the goniometer; (2) upgrade the photo-detector and the light source to reduce measurement uncertainty and permit measurement of pavement marking retroreflectivity using revised testing procedures. Gamma Scientific will also provide an irradiance standard to calibrate the detector for absolute photometry,thereby reducing  the uncertainty in measuring LED signal lights and other direct emitting devices; (3) add a CCD colorimeter to permit measurement of the color of retroreflective materials (specifically, the nighttime color of pavement markings, sign sheeting and other traffic control devices) (4) provide a mounting bracket for measurement of RRPMs and for verifying the observation angle of a measurement, and; (5) provide a new version of the instrument control and data acquisition software to accommodate the new capabilities.  Gamma Scientific will also provide installation and technical support for the new hardware and to insure proper function of the software.  As the designer and sole manufacturer of the ART 940D auto-ranging gonio-photometer, Gamma Scientific is the only known source that can provide the hardware, software, and technical assistance for revisions, upgrade, maintenance, and operation of the instrument.  All responsible sources may submit a response identifying their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the total estimated value is not to exceed $79,665.00 and the anticipated award date is September 4, 2008.

Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

www.section508.gov
 
www.access-board.gov
 
Do you have questions about Section 508? Do you need information on applying Section 508 to your EIT procurement?  Contact Sheilah Lynch, 301-827-9372 or by email at Sheilah.Lynch@fda.hhs.gov

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Jewish General Hospital; Lady David Institute, Pollack Research Lab – E 423; 3755 Cote Ste. Catherine Rd.; Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2 services regarding serum levels of leptin, an adiponectin by standard ELISA procedures in 852 kidney cancer cases.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 622110 and the business size standard is $31.5M employees.

The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common histological type of kidney cancer, has increased rapidly in the United States, particularly among African Americans.  The prevalence of obesity in this country has also increased over the past few decades.  Despite a well-established link between obesity and kidney cancer, the mechanism through which obesity acts to increase cancer risk has yet to be definitively established.  Recently, adipokines, biologically active peptides secreted by adipocytes, have been identified and proposed as the potential link between obesity and cancer.  Although several of these markers have demonstrated promising results as predictors of risk and progression in several other obesity-related cancers, it is yet to be determined whether these biomarkers may explain the association between obesity and kidney cancer. 

The purpose of the current procurement is to determine serum levels of leptin and adiponectin by standard ELISA procedures in 852 kidney cancer cases, 820 controls, and an additional 100 blinded quality control samples. In this study, we propose to measure serum leptin and adiponectin levels by ELISA in kidney cancer cases and controls from a large case-control study.  The purpose of this study is to investigate whether serum adipokines levels are associated with kidney cancer survival; and to characterize adipokines levels and relate them to body mass index and other health indicators.  Extensive questionnaire data and biologic samples have already been collected for these study populations.  Knowledge gained from this study will provide important information on characterizing adipokines levels and its relation to kidney cancer.

The Period of Performance shall be twelve months from date of award.

The Jewish General Hospital at the Lady Davis Institute has extensive experience and specializes in examining circulating levels of hormones and other analytes implicated in carcinogenesis with high assay precision. The Jewish General Hospital is capable of measuring serum adipokines with high-throughput to analyze the needed number of samples. Adiponectin and leptin are both established assays in the Jewish General Hospital. To simplify the control of laboratory operations and guarantee standardized quality control procedures among studies from NCI, it is essential to conduct the adipokine assays at the same lab. There is no other source known to the NCI that can complete the requirements of this study. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 11:00 AM EST on August 30, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80196-MM on all correspondence

(A Solicitation for this procurement will be published HEREAFTER, in this same FedBizOpps website.)  This procurement is 8(a)-competitive, meaning that each offeror must be an 8(a) company, certified as such by SBA.  The incumbent contractor is MacroSys Research and Technology, whose offices are located  at Suite 312, 888  17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 20006.

The information set forth in this Synopsis is ALL of the information that DOT plans to release concerning this procurement, until DOT hereafter publishes this procurement’s Solicitation in FedBizOpps.  Therefore, please HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS until after you have carefully studied the forthcoming Solicitation.  The due date shown above is only an ESTIMATED due date for DOT’s receipt of proposals.  The ACTUAL due date for proposals will be specified in the SOLICITATION hereafter published in this FedBizOpps website.

The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) hopes to award one contract from this procurement.   It is anticipated that the resulting contract will have one Base Year and four Option Years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Included in this database should be a collection of public records, unpublished opinions, legal, news, and business information as well as local news through-out the country.  The database should be a combination of news and business information including publications such as the Dow Jones, New York Times and Harvard Business Review.  The database should contain a record of published items since at least the 1980s and be available in full text. 

The database should provide a variety of search options, which can be customized by the user, in order to allow for accurate searching.  Additionally, the service should have an alert feature which will automatically search and notify the user when their topic, person, or company specified shows up in the news.  GSA would like to use this database to gain insight into people, assets, businesses, locations, topics of interest and their relationships. 

The contract should be a volume usage contract.  For instance, there is no limit to the number of users, but is billed based on usage.  Therefore, we are asking for a proposal for access to the database and search services per month/annually which would include a minimum of 3X the invoice usage to 6X the invoice usage. 

The system will be used at the GSA Regional Office Building, the Strawbridge building, 20 N. 8th Street, Philadelphia, PA  19107.  The estimated dollar value for the procurement is between $5,000.00 and $25,000.00.  This procurement is unrestricted and subject to availability of funds.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The National Director of Energy;  Ministry of Energy and Water Affairs;  Rua Conego Manuel das Neves no. 234; Predio EDEL;  Luanda, Angola;  Tel. +244 222 430 211;  Fax +244 222 430 107. 

Angola: Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation and Hydropower Development Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to carry out the proposed Technical Assistance for the Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation and Hydropower Development Project in Angola.

With only 15% of Angola’s population currently served by the electricity distribution system, rehabilitation and upgrade of the system are critical to the country’s economic growth and political stability.  This Technical Assistance will develop master plans for two interior cities, Cuchi and Luena, to implement a modern distribution system with increased generation capacity from small hydroelectric plants.  Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water Affairs (MEWA) is the Grantee.

MEWA has already developed a sector strategy with other donor assistance that includes debundling the Angolan power sector while engaging the private sector in management, operation, and possibly ownership of distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure.  Distribution has been prioritized in the strategy and this Technical Assistance has been recommended as the next step toward implementing this strategy.  The rehabilitation and modernization of distribution systems could be used as a model for the rest of the country.  The project will facilitate the integration of previously isolated distribution systems; the development of appropriate tariff structures that will allow for the sustainable development of the electric power sector; and the introduction of small scale private power generation systems.

Terms of Reference:

Task 1: Assessment and Diagnosis of the State of Existing Distribution Infrastructure
Task 2: Study of Projected Energy Demand
Task 3: Site Visit to Location of Proposed Hydropower Projects
Task 4: Preparation of Preliminary Facility Design and Cost Estimates 
Task 5: Economic and Financial Analysis of Projects and Pre-Feasibility Report
Task 6: Development of Recommendations for Development of Proposed Hydropower Project
Task 7: Master Plan for Rehabilitation of Distribution Systems
Task 8: Creation of a Master Plan for Electricity Network Expansion
Task 9: Preparation of Proposed Tariff Structure for Isolated Systems
Task 10: Preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
Task 11: Preparation of a Final Report and Developmental Impact Assessment

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $626,850 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM local time, October 10, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

<p>With:<br />"At the closing of the transaction, the Government will lease certain land and will lease or convey certain improvements, described in Section 1.2.1.1 and 1.2.1.2, including approximately seven miles of sewer line and three existing facilities located at the Wastewater Treatment Plant as further described in Section 2.0, Existing Conditions. Restrictions specific to individual facilities will be identified in Section 2.0 and 3.0. The WWTP is the only area of the three parcels that has improvements.</p>
<p>Table 1 below provides a list of the facilities to be leased or conveyed to the Lessee."</p>
<p>2. The following is a description of Clarifications on Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) Opportunity:</p>
<p>The Air Force consciously decided to build maximum flexibility into its RFQ. It seeks the most innovative proposal that industry can prepare and submit. There is a range of acceptable proposals, but you are reminded that this is a competition. The Air Force will select the most qualified offeror that has a proposal that maximizes the Air Force's consideration, while minimizing its environmental responsibility and liability. The details of the transaction are left to the Phase III discussions and negotiations.</p>
<p>The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board ("State regulator") is California's regulating agency for waste water discharges at Beale Air Force Base ("AFB"). Currently, the Beale AFB Environmental Flight is responsible for all activities regarding waste water compliance program.<br />The Air Force's strong preference is for the WWTP portion of any EUL proposal to be structured as follows-</p>
<p>1. The offeror will accept ownership of the WWTP facilities by quitclaim deed, but lease all lands required for its successful operation. This may include leasing the water canon field(s), waste water effluent storage ponds, stream discharge point(s), etc.</p>
<p>2. The offeror will be solely responsible and liable for the operations of the WWTP. The offeror will obtain its own NPDES permit with the State regulator. If the offeror decides to continue and/or expand land-based discharge, the offeror will have to negotiate the specific waste discharge requirements with the State regulator.</p>
<p><br />3. The offeror is free to propose and fund any necessary upgrades to, or expansion of, the facilities, which it will own. The Air Force expects the offeror to obtain all necessary approvals for such upgrades or expansions.</p>
<p>See attached map for potential additional land areas to be leased.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the offeror is free to propose a different structure. The offeror may propose to operate the WWTP, but not own it. The facilities and land areas would be leased to the offeror. This is less preferable to the Air Force. Under such an alternative scenario, the State regulator might still hold Beale AFB liable for noncompliance issues regarding the WWTP because the Air Force remains the owner. Therefore, the Air Force would retain oversight for all correspondence and negotiations regarding the program, which would still be the responsibility of the Air Force. Under this scenario, the Air Force would prefer that an offeror provide a qualified waste water engineer to act as a liaison between the offeror and the Air Force in the oversight of the environmental compliance of the waste water program.</p>
<p>1.

<DESC><p>TO: ALL Potential Respondents 20 Aug 2008</p>
<p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Information Regarding Space Radar Capability</p>
<p>The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics has requested a market survey of existing and planned space radar systems to meet joint warfighter needs. The capabilities of interest include: 1. Space radar imaging data from currently operating systems (2009-2012+) and 2. Low cost commercial and international SAR space and ground system(s) that are low risk for Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in government Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information on existing commercial and international systems or low risk systems in development.</p>
<p>This letter is a Request For Information (RFI) only and the US Government does not assert or imply that any Request for Proposal (RFP) or other acquisition action will occur as a result of this RFI; however, all potential respondents are advised that funding has been requested for providing space radar data and/or a new acquisition which could begin in FY09, with initial government operation of the first vehicle expected in FY12.</p>
<p>To meet the need for a space radar system on schedule, the government anticipates a low-risk design approach. The government is currently refining the definition of the mission needs that this potential system will satisfy. The government is particularly interested in existing space radar system designs with demonstrated on-orbit performance. The government desires to understand products, designs, hardware, and software that will minimize risk in order to deliver an operationally useful integrated satellite system in the time required.</p>
<p>The government invites all radar data providers and space radar system developers that can deliver capabilities to respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>The Government requests a white paper with completed System parameter sheets in response to this RFI. Respondents are asked to deliver the submission, by no later than 1400 hours Pacific Standard Time on 8 Sept 2008 to the undersigned in both hardcopy and softcopy form to:</p>

<p>3. Photographs and/or a detailed description of the proposed test equipment in place at the contractor's test facility demonstrating capability for fulfilling the tasks listed below.</p>
<p>4. A safety plan indicating the general approach the contractor will take to prevent test equipment overpressure and explosion and personnel exposure to high pressure and toxic chemicals during the fulfillment of the work described below.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to obtain specialized laboratory calorimetry testing services to characterize the behavior of possible runaway chemical reactions. Data derived from calorimetry testing will be used to establish chemical reaction kinetic parameters. Data will also be used to perform engineering calculations to estimate the size of commercial equipment necessary to safely vent uncontrolled reactions</p>
<p>TASKS:</p>
<p>All work must be performed at the contractor's facilities. The contractor shall provide all equipment required to perform the services. The CSB will specify the reaction conditions under which the tests will be run. All instruments must be calibrated prior to testing and the contractor must include the calibration records in the written report.</p>
<p>Task 1: Safety Plan Development</p>
<p>The reactions being tested are of known runaway potential. The contractor must develop a detailed written safety plan that provides for the safety of all personnel and the facilities at use in this work. The safety plan must include detailed instructions for venting, reaction quenching or other means to prevent explosion and personnel exposure to high pressure gases and potentially toxic emission.</p>
<p>If exposure to toxic materials is anticipated, the safety plan must include requirements for exposure prevention and monitoring. The plan must identify the certified safety professional responsible for the execution and oversight of the safety plan.</p>
<p>The written safety plan must be submitted to and approved by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) prior to the start of work.</p>
<p>Task 2: Materials Procurement</p>
<p>Procure the necessary chemical reagents in accordance with quality specifications provided by CSB. (Specifications will follow). Sufficient quantity of reagents must be obtained to perform all of the required analytical runs specified by the CSB. In some cases materials may be provided by the CSB.</p>
<p>Task 3: Adiabatic Reaction Calorimetry</p>
<p>Perform adiabatic reaction calorimetry to determine kinetic properties of the reaction--namely rate of temperature rise and rate of pressure rise-using the Accelerating Rate Calorimeter (ARC) methodology as described in ASTM E1981(2004). Document the results in tabular and graphical formats.</p>
<p>The CSB will specify starting conditions and instructions with respect to the number and configurations of reaction runs.</p>
<p>Record the temperature and pressure at appropriate intervals during each run. At the conclusion of each run, calculate the rate of temperature rise and rate of pressure rise, and report the raw data and calculation results.</p>
<p>Task 4: Bench-Scale Batch Reactor Test</p>
<p>Perform instrumented reaction runs under conditions specified by the CSB using a commercially-available bench-scale reactor, such as the Fauske Vent Size Package (VSP ), Mettler-Toledo RC1 Reaction Calorimeter, Mettler-Toledo Contalab or equivalent.</p>
<p>The CSB will provide starting conditions and instructions with respect to the number and configurations of reaction runs.</p>
<p>Record the temperature and pressure at appropriate intervals during each run. At the conclusion of each run, calculate the rate of temperature rise and rate of pressure rise, and report the raw data and calculation results.</p>
<p>Task 5: Materials Disposal</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the work as directed by the COTR, the contractor is responsible for proper disposal of any remaining reactant materials, reaction products, waste products or other materials resulting from this work in a proper and safe manner and in accordance with all pertinent federal, state and local regulations.</p>
<p>Task 6: Written Report</p>
<p>The contractor will prepare a detailed written report that includes the following minimum information:</p>
<p>1. Starting conditions and composition of each reaction run.<br />2. All test data collected in tabular and graphical form.<br />3. Photo-documentation of the test equipment.<br />4. Calibration records for all instrumentation used to record test data.<br />5. Any conclusions and observations arising from the testing.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>November 1, 2008 - December 31, 2008<br />* The actual period of performance is subject to vary depending on the actual award date.</p>
<p>SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>Confidentiality: If this RFI results in the issuance of a solicitation and award of a contract, the selected contractor, and its personnel assigned to the contract, will be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement to ensure the protection of trade secrets, confidential business information, and sensitive investigative information. The contractor will also be required to ensure that any subcontractors supporting the contract execute equivalent non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>Conflicts of Interest: If this RFI results in the issuance of a solicitation and award of a contract, the selected contractor will be required to agree to a set of CSB-specific supplemental contract terms. These terms include, among other provisions, the following conflicts of interest clause:<br />Organizational Conflicts of Interest<br />a. Contractor, its personnel, and any other person or entity performing work for Contractor on behalf of the CSB, shall execute a certification of non-conflict of interest. Such executed certification constitutes the signatory's acknowledgement that he has read and understood the requirements of this clause and agrees to abide by its terms.<br />b. Contractor and its personnel performing work for the CSB under this contract should not be placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (whether financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise), which relate to the work performed under this contract, nor should Contractor obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance under this contract.<br />c. Contractor warrants that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or in the alternative, warrants that it has fully disclosed all such relevant information. Additionally, during the term of this contract, Contractor agrees to forego entering into any other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization, the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract. Contractor shall ensure that all agents, employees, and subcontractors retained for any purpose under this contract abide by the provisions of this entire clause. If Contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any of its agents, employees, or subcontractors, that any proposed contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB before the execution of such contractual arrangement.<br />d. Contractor further agrees that if, after it commences work for the CSB, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB. It is agreed that this disclosure will include a description of the action that Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate the conflicts. Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary and/or supplemental action to be taken.<br />e. It is the specific responsibility of Contractor to ensure that any and all subcontractors, and any subcontractors' employees, are free from conflicts of interest. Contractor warrants that no subcontractors already identified, or any of their subcontractors' employees, have an identifiable conflict of interest. It is further agreed that, in the event a conflict of interest is discovered after award of the subcontract, the same rules for disclosure, and all of the same remedies open to the CSB, described below, remain binding. Contractor further agrees to insert in each subcontract or agreement done in furtherance of this contract, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this entire clause.<br />f. During the period of performance under this contract, Contractor specifically agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for T2 Laboratories Inc. (T2) or for T2's agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the Dec. 19, 2007, incident at the T2 facility in Jacksonville, Florida); or for any other entity or individual that is the subject of an official CSB investigation. Contractor also agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for T2 or its agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the December 19, 2007, incident at the T2 facility in Jacksonville, Florida) for a period of 6 months after final completion of the contracted services rendered to the CSB. Additionally, if Contractor performs work for the CSB under contract at the site of an official CSB investigation, Contractor agrees not to solicit work at that site from the entity or individual being investigated for a period of 6 months after the issuance of the final CSB report on that investigation.<br />g. Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing prohibitions, the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB may authorize Contractor to solicit or perform this general type of work if the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel determine that the situation will not pose a potential for bias or unfair competitive advantage, and that the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB approve of the proposed solicitation or work.<br />h. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant conflicts of interest required to be disclosed concerning this contract, or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the CSB may terminate the contract for default, disqualify Contractor from subsequent contracts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this contract. Notwithstanding these remedies, however, the CSB may always terminate the contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if termination is in the best interest of the government.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation encompasses P-3 aircraft maintenance and logistics support necessary to ensure that the Government has the numbers, types, and properly configured P-3 aircraft available where and when required to meet the Government aviation operational commitments. This requirement has been met as part of a single National Aviation Maintenance Contract for approximately 20 years. The CBP P-3 aircraft are being separated from this contract to enable dedicated support for this complex aging asset.   The general nature of the required solicitation support has remained essentially the same; however, locations, equipment, and numbers of aircraft have varied.  The Government aircraft are assigned on a permanent and temporary basis to P-3 Operations Centers located at military air bases, civilian air facilities and alternate sites in the United States and foreign locations. The aviation program also provides air support to other government and law enforcement agencies upon request.

<DESC>The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHD/NSWC) is seeking companies with technical expertise and experience in the production and testing of Methyl Violet (MV) and Potassium Iodide (KI)/Starch test papers. The KI/starch and MV test papers are used to qualify various nitrate esters, gun propellants, etc. for military munitions/ordnance as per test methods described below.  These are to be made using a formula and protocols similar to Analytical Methods for Powders and Explosives AB Bofors, 1974 pp 45-7 or Franklin Research Institute Encyclopedia Vol. 8 P 118M. Applicable sections of MIL-STD 105 and 109 may apply. Testing of the finished papers for suitability of response will be conducted as per MIL-STD-286C method 404.1.2 and MIL-N-246B paragraph 4.3.4 at a minimum, with MIL-N-244B paragraph 4.5.8 also recommended and applicable. Additional testing for in-process quality assurance is also suggested as the end item performance is not guaranteed by adherence to the manufacturing process.  The Government anticipates the total quantity per year for these test papers to be 20K-50K per year each.
Manufacturing of these test papers requires an extensive background in the production of test papers as their end performance is very much influenced by the manufacturing environment and specific lots of dyestuffs used in the case of the MV paper. Further, the proper performance testing of the papers requires access to liquid nitrate esters, (potentially dry nitrocellulose), several military propellants and the ability/facility to conduct the prescribed tests in a safe manner. These materials are extremely hazardous due to their explosive properties and must be handled in accordance to proper practices. Technical expertise to sustain quality throughout all phases of the manufacturing process; and an established internal quality control system are also required. 
All responding sources shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including organization name, address, a description of facilities and/or equipment, manufacturing process, inspection capability, personnel, past experience, and current production capacity per month. Since ability to test these papers requires access to explosives and other energetic materials conform to local, state and federal laws, regulations and appropriate safety and security measures must be demonstrated. 
It is also required to provide a point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 31 October 2008 to: 
Frederick HeimIndian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center Applied Analytical Laboratory   5326 Whitman Ct.  Bldg. 1864 Indian Head, MD 20640-5160301-744-1609
Responses can also be submitted by email to frederick.heim@navy.mil. Large files need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com).	
This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.
If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. 
All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

<DESC>This is a notification that the Office of the Director, Office of Logistics Acquisitions Management intends to negotiate on a sole source order with Barbara Levy under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to provide Procurement Policy Services using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13.106-1(b)-only one source reasonably available.  Attached is the draft Statement of Work.

Barbara Levy has comprehensive knowledge of the work, contacts and lines of
reporting necessary to research and respond to the various special projects that
arise.  Her experience makes the assistance she can provide to DAPE staff unique and invaluable.  In addition, Ms Levy has a wide breadth of knowledge of activities outside of DAPE, such as the Acquisition Integration and Modernization project at HHS, human subjects and inclusion of woman and minorities in research, etc. as well as a good understanding of the NIH environment based on her many interactions and service on various working committees over the years.  She is fully able to function independently to provide the needed assistance and
advice.  Ms. Levy also has expert knowledge of U.S. Government and HHS contracting laws and regulations and NIH policies.  Thus she has the balance of acquisition expertise and NIH experience that make her uniquely able to carry out special projects for DAPE.

NIH knows of no one else who can fulfill this acquisition requirement within the timeframe necessary and with the degree of expertise and experience needed for the quick responses that are necessary in many instances.  It would be cost-prohibitive to attempt to orient and train another contractor in the complexities and unique characteristics of the work required. Substituting another contractor would involve an extensive learning curve on the part of the new individual as well as increased and duplicative costs.  

The North American Industry Classification System is 541618 and the size standard is $7,000,000.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes preparation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist by August 30, 2008 at 1pm EST. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Aleise Roberts at aleiser@od.nih.gov. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, NIH will proceed with the sole source purchase order.

<RESPDATE>121508
<CONTACT>Susan Truslow, Policy Analyst, Phone 202-395-6810, Email struslow@omb.eop.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY: The Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), established an interagency working group to develop best practices, guidance, and templates regarding use of incentives and awards in federal contracting.  This notice asks for information that can be used by that group.  

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Susan Truslow at (202) 395-6810.

DATES:  Comments should be received by December 15, 2008

ADDRESSES:  All comments should be submitted electronically to:  struslow@omb.eop.gov.  Comments submitted via regular mail or fax will not be accepted.  We do not intend to post comments received publicly.  However, we request that any business confidential information be redacted from any material submitted.  

PURPOSE:  

The purpose of this RFI is to develop best practices for incentive and award fee contracting and enhance collaboration between government and industry.

BACKGROUND:  

Incentive contracts, including award fee and award term, are used throughout the Federal Government and contribute to a substantial portion of federal contracting dollars spent.  These types of contracts are intended to motivate excellent contractor performance while obtaining best value.  By their very nature, incentive contracts are varied in scope and approach.  Although they share a common basic structure defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 16.4), incentive contracts can be designed and applied in many ways which can result in some incentive contracts not producing their intended objectives.  

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published reports and identified programs and contracts in which incentive and award fee practices did not result in achievement of contract objectives.  GAO also identified practices that reduce the effectiveness of fees as a motivational tool.  As a result, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy published “Appropriate Use of Incentive Contracts” December 4, 2007; from which an interagency working group was established and several pieces of legislation on incentive and award fee contracting have been initiated. 

DESCRIPTION:  

The incentive contracting working group (ICWG) requests discussions and examples of successful uses of incentive and award fees under federal contracts from government and industry that it can use when developing best practices.  Information sought includes a copy of a successful incentive arrangement from a contract (suitably redacted if necessary), along with a discussion of how the incentives were developed, how they were applied, and why they were successful.  Also needed are examples of incentives that did not produce their intended results.  These examples should include the same types of information along with a discussion of why they did not succeed as intended.  The working group hopes to obtain examples from more than just Government sources.  Examples discussed from the point of view of a contractor or an industry association will be very useful in helping to promote successful incentive arrangements. 

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE REQUESTED INFORMATION, PLEASE ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:

1.	What improvements can we make in how we manage our incentive contracts?
2.	Which incentive type is the most attractive to you and why?
3.	How many evaluation periods are typically in your contract? 
a.	Has this been successful?  
b.	Would you like more frequent periods or less? 
4.	Are there contractual practices that could improve cost effectiveness? Consider business arrangements, contract types, incentive/fee strategies, and contract clauses. If applicable, address funding strategies.
5.	Are we incentivizing contractor cost efficiency & effective cost/performance trade-offs?

DESIRED FORMAT:

In order for the ICWG to may make the most efficient use of comments, we request that they be submitted by e-mail in an electronic format that permits text and illustrations to be used readily in the production of other material.  Also, please try to limit discussions to 20 pages, exclusive of examples.

<a href="mailto:kathryn.mccune@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Agency (USAMRMC), has a requirement to complete the advanced development of a portable infusion pump with warming capability. USAMRAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Smisson-Cartledge Biomedical, LLC. The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302(a)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and FAR 6.302(a)(2)(ii), supplies are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Smisson-Cartledge has been working with the Government since 2002 to develop a portable, variable rate infusion pump capable of infusing warmed resuscitative fluids or blood to trauma patients suffering from hypovolemic shock. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared this system for marketing in 2006. However, a new and more rigorous version of the compliance standard for this type of medical device was also published in 2006, prior to the contractor's commercial marketing. This has forced the contractor to re-engineer the system to meet the new safety standards. The re-engineered system, and its subsystems, must now be re-tested and re-validated to ensure that the changes made do not present any new risks to patients or operators. Given the significant Government investment that has gone into the development of this technology, it would not be practical for MRMC to turn to another contractor to complete the testing and validation of this system as the major technological and regulatory hurdles have already been largely overcome through application of proprietary engineering solutions developed alone by Smisson-Cartledge LLC. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by way of the Contract Specialist within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability within the established timeframe. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Kathryn McCune at kathryn.mccune@us.army.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

As used in this clause--<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.<br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.<br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:<br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.<br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

<p>&nbsp;The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 effective 12 June 2008, DFAR DCN 20080721 and AFFAR AFAC 2008-0605. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 443120, Computer And Software Stores The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 5734. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded.</p>
<p>Note: FAR 52.232-18 applies to this solicitation and procurement. Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.</p>
<p>EMC Documentum Records Manager 5.3 SP4 is a DoD 5015.2 certified software application designed to manage electronic, non-electronic, and e-mail records to include classified records. EMC Documentum 5.3 Records Manager extends Documentum's existing Content Management functionality by adding features and functions specific to records management such as corporate file plans, retention policies (RPS), file- and field-level security along with the ability to manage and declare records. This solution is USSOCOM's chosen DoD compliant Electronic Records Management application which is operated on our internal network and manages HQ USSOCOM and its components official records. In order to continue to operate this system, we need to procure the software license maintenance updates.</p>
<p>In addition, to award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through full and open competition as well as unacceptable delays in filling government requirements. The&nbsp;total cost required&nbsp;to integrate a new system into the current USSOCOM enterprise architecture are totaled below.&nbsp;This cost estimate is based on initial licensing, license maintenance, consulting services, training, and travel/TDY costs. The cost does not&nbsp;include other factors like additional server licenses, lost manpower hours, data migration costs, end user training, and system down-time to the command. Additionally, it would directly affect and negatively impact other systems that are currently being fielded at USSOCOM and require this application:</p>
<p><br />Expenditure Qty Cost Total Of A New System<br />Total Cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1,073,475.40</p>
<p>The above estimate was compiled based on our current electronic records management system configuration and prices are subject to change dependant upon how each vendor packages their licenses. This most certainly would result in USSOCOM having to purchase additional license types in order to field a different electronic records management system.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties may request full synopsis/solicitation package No Later Than 25 August 2008.  All requests must be in writing via emaiil to jeannette.jordan@hqda.army.mil or ruby.mixon@hqda.army.mil. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS.<BR><BR><BR>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES<BR>FOR<BR>Army Civilian University (ACU) <BR>For the Civilian Development Office<BR>1.0	Scope<BR><BR>This effort requires the contactor to provide advisory and assistance services supporting Army Civilian University (ACU) to develop an integrated structure that ties various Department of the Army (DA) schools together in one system under existing guidance of regulations shown in section 3 below. <BR><BR>The ACU and its schools will reside under the Combined Arms Center (CAC), TRADOC.  A concept of operations template must be designed to describe and transition each non-TRADOC school under ACU oversight resulting in an effective and efficient ACU school model that incorporates best practices of business/industry, academia, and government schools to strive for high educational quality at efficient costs through shared services.  Using the Army Management Staff College (ASMC) as the ACU pilot school coming under ACU, the contractor shall develop an ACU prototype analysis and design template to bring each future school under the ACU command and control. <BR><BR>2.0  	Background:  <BR><BR>a. In 2003, the Secretary of the Army (SA) became convinced that Army civilians had insufficient educational and training opportunities. Senior Army leaders commissioned various studies including the Army Training and Leader Development Panel (ATLDP), the Senior Army Workforce (SAW), and later the Review of Education, Training and Assignments for Leaders (RETAL).    <BR><BR>b. The RETAL initiative determined how the Army develops military and civilian leaders to serve in both operational and generating force capacities. Senior Army leadership accelerated change in leader development programs to grow leaders for tomorrows strategic environment.  In the area of civilian training and education, a modified program enhanced civilian leader education: the Army Management Staff Colleges (AMSC) Civilian Education System (CES) offers progressive and sequential civilian leader training. The ACU will be the higher headquarters for civilian generating force training and leader development activities.<BR><BR>c. To meet increased leadership demands and grow leaders for tomorrows strategic environment, on 19 July, 2007, the SA and the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) directed the establishment of the ACU to provide enterprise-level oversight of the civilian education system. On 9 April, 2008, HQDA approved the concept plan to stand up the ACU, and move to TRADOC.  On 11 July, 2008, the SA and CSA signed an Army implementing Directive that established the ACU. The ACU will provide oversight and governance of each appropriate DA generating force and civilian leader development activity.  The stand-up of the ACU is just the beginning of an Army enterprise plan to develop the capabilities and leadership of Army civilians in the Generating Force. <BR><BR>	d. The inclusion of schools under ACU will facilitate the increased role of civilians in Army leadership positions, mitigate the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) impact, allows the Army to effectively compete for talent, and enhances the Armys ability to prepare for demographic changes occurring in the civilian workforce. <BR><BR>3.	Applicable Documents<BR>"	Army Regulation (AR) 350-1 Training and Leader Development<BR>"	Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation (TR) 350-70 Systems Approach to Training Management, Processes, and Products<BR><BR>4.	Statement of Objectives: <BR><BR>4.1  The contractor shall perform advisory and assistance support services in accordance with the current Army regulatory and policy directives and any portion of the contractors proposed processes that are incorporated into this contract.  This effort requires the contractor to conduct extensive data collection and analysis to assist DUSA in establishing the framework for the emerging corporate university. Specific tasks include:<BR><BR>   4.1.1 The contractor shall schedule, organize and facilitate a kick off meeting among the COR, contractor and ACU staff within five (5) work days after contract award.  No less than one (1) work day prior to kick-off meeting, the contractor shall prepare and submit an agenda to the ACU Deputy for review and approval.

The contractor shall develop a report that describes the operational or facilities redundancies across ACU schools from which efficiencies may occur. <BR><BR>a.	The contractor shall perform a cost benefit and functional analysis and provide an operational redundancy report that contains the functions or activities performed by one or more schools that, through economies of scale, can add value or cost savings/avoidance to ACU. <BR><BR>b.	The contractor shall identify where ACU consolidation provides best value for the Army and how standardization of functions benefits the ACU. <BR><BR>c.

Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

www.section508.gov
 
www.access-board.gov
 
Do you have questions about Section 508? Do you need information on applying Section 508 to your EIT procurement?  Contact Sheilah Lynch, 301-827-9372 or by email at Sheilah.Lynch@fda.hhs.gov

C-1 - Description/Specifications/Work Statement

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary personnel, materials, services and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work as described below:

In preparation for this project, significant work towards fulfillment of Part I of this study has already been performed by Indivumed, such as standardized tissue collection, comprehensive data accrual by interviewing patients, data validation by our documentation assistants and the establishment of various protocols for Ventana-Immunohistochemistry staining.

Part I – determine expression of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and erythropoietin (Epo) by immuno-histochemical staining of tissue samples collected under the “Indivumed-Standard.”  The Indivumed standard refers to Indivumed’s highly standardized bio-specimens and clinical data collection protocol which is ensured by the fact that Indivumed personnel 1) have full control over all steps of tissue collection, and 2) document accurately a variety of pre-, intra- and postsurgical factors that might impact molecular reality in tissue samples.  For example, Indivumed tissues are characterized by a very short and exactly documented cold ischemia time of less than 12 min.  This may be of importance, as it is known that EpoR expression is related to tissue hypoxia.  For this study, we will use tissue samples with an average cold ischemia time of 8 (+/- 4) minutes.  We will prepare a Tissue-Micro-Array (TMA) that consists of tumor specimens from 50 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 patients with breast cancer.  Tumor stage and grad will be distributed equally.  As a control, we will use a TMA consisting of corresponding normal tissues from the same patients.

For immunohistochemistry staining we will establish a protocol for the Ventana-technology platform which we use for automated routine tissue staining.  In addition to EpoR and Epo, we will immuno-histochemically analyze the expression of Ki67 (proliferation rate), caspase 3/7 (apoptotic rate), and Stat5 (total and phosphoprotein levels).  All expression data will be correlated with clinical data such as hemoglobin level, tumor stage and tumor grading, age, gender and, if required, up to 300 additional individual data points already available from data base for each patient.

Part II – determine the role of Epo and EpoR in activation of signaling pathways and growth/proliferation of tumor cells, e.g. via defining and Epo dose response in primary tumor cells.  Indivumed has already prepared various colorectal cancer primary cell cultures that grow by nature continuously in vitro.  For these cells Indivumed still has the corresponding original primary tumor available that allows comparative analysis of the expression profile.

Determine the expression profile of Epo and EpoR by immunostaining and possibly, RT-PCR in cells and primary tumor tissue.  If comparable, we will continue to analyze the impact of Epo on cell growth (proliferation/apoptosis) and signaling pathways (MSD-technology).  Also, establish a model for inhibiting Epo effects by adding various dilutions of soluble Epo-R (sEpo-R).  sEpo-R which will be provided by collaborators of the FDA.  To perform these studies we will use at least one primary cancer cell line which was established and characterized. 

Part III – Functional analysis of the Epo/EpoR interaction using molecular drug profiling platform.  This technology is based on instantly cultivated tumor tissue (vital tissue slices of 200-400 um) which is incubated with a compound of interest and various controls.  Cultivate and treat tissue slices from 20 breast cancer patients.  In addition, EpoR and Epo expression as well as expression of Epo signaling pathway molecules (e.g. Stat5) will be determined in instantly fixed tumor tissue and compared to cultivated tissue slices.  This is done to exclude or at least determine variations of the expression profile due to the cultivation process.

Slices will be treated with:
1.	Epo
2.	Epo + different dilution of sEpo-R
3.	Negative control 1 (medium only)
4.	Negative control 2 (Epo-solvent, e.g. DMSO)
5.	Camptothecin (toxic control)

Tissue slice analysis will include:
1.	Viability (ATP assay)
2.	Apoptotic rate (Caspase assay)
3.	Analysis for Epo-related pathway molecules (MSD technology)
4.	Expression of Epo, Epo-R, Ki67 (proliferation rate) and Epo-related phosphor-proteins (need to be determined) by using Ventana-technology for immunohistochemistry.

The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-08-00846.  Quotations are September 3, 2008, by 1:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time in Jefferson, AR; at Food and Drug Administration, OC/OSS/OFFAS, Attention: Sandra Davis, 3900 NCTR Rd., Jefferson AR 72079-9502.

<DESC>B – NIST Technical Support Services for Accessible Voting Systems-Usability Performance, July 30, 2008 

This is a solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NB894040-8-05964 is issued as a request for quotation. This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 511210.  The NIST has a requirement for technical support services for accessible voting systems-usability performance.  I. Background Information -Enacted by Congress in October 2002, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) legislation gives the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) a key role in helping realize nationwide improvements in voting systems.  NIST's Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is coordinating the agency's HAVA efforts through its expertise in areas such as computer security, laboratory accreditation procedures, and usability.  The HAVA created an Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee voting standards work. Reporting to the EAC is the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), which makes recommendations on voluntary standards and guidelines related to voting equipment.  The Human Factors and Privacy (HFP) Subcommittee of the TGDC focused on recommendations for the development of voluntary voting system standards and guidance in the areas of human factors, usability, accessibility, and privacy.  NIST is providing technical and administrative support to the TGDC.  The EAC adopted a new set of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) in December 2005.  The EAC asked the TGDC and NIST to develop a more comprehensive and re-organized version of the VVSG.  A complete draft of this updated version was delivered to the EAC in the summer of 2007.   NIST will address changes to VVSG as requested by the EAC after the public comment period.  NIST will also develop test methods for the VVSG and address technical issues as they arise during discussions with the TGDC and the EAC.

The TGDC has directed NIST to develop usability performance-based requirements in addition to design requirements under the guidance of the HFP Subcommittee.  Some of these usability performance requirements for the voter interface will take the form of benchmarks based on the results of research, which have produced usability metrics, a test protocol, a standard test ballot, and a controlled set of test participants.   Initial work at NIST has shown that this test protocol, the NIST Voting Performance Protocol (VPP) is a valid usability test and is repeatable.  The NIST VPP is intended to be a repeatable, controlled experiment. The goal is not primarily to provide a “realistic” measure of voting behavior, but rather to isolate and measure the relative usability effect of various voting systems – and this requires that all other potential variables be held as constant as possible.)  Finally, it is important to note that the goal of the benchmarks is to discriminate among voting systems to identify those systems with poor usability.  The NIST VPP and the derived benchmarks are intended for use by voting system tests laboratories to certify systems as meeting the requirements in the VVSG.

Other pass/fail performance tests for usability and accessibility in the form of tightly controlled usability tests are also under development.   The benchmark tests are intended to be applied to all voting systems, including accessible systems.  Preliminary investigations of the accessible systems have uncovered additional issues specific to voters with disabilities which point out the need to look more carefully at these systems and how they are tested.

II. Objective of this Procurement -For the most part, voting systems examined thus far were NOT designated as accessible voting systems.  Accessible voting systems must meet both the usability requirements and the accessibility requirements of the VVSG.  HAVA mandates one such system per polling place.  However, it is very important that the accessible systems for voters with disabilities also meet the benchmarks and to understand what other usability performance issues occur with these systems.  NIST has some preliminary data about performance, but there are many gaps.  The overall objective of this procurement is to obtain Contractor assistance to gather additional data on the usability performance of accessible systems using the NIST VPP and other methods and to determine what changes, to ensure that the VVSG has testable usability performance requirements for accessible voting systems.

In coordination with the NIST COTR, the Contractor will accomplish the following:
•	Identify usability performance tests for accessible voting systems for the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG).
•	Design the protocols for usability performance tests using the VPP where possible.
•	Pilot test and collect data with tests participants with a range of different disabilities
•	Analyze the usability performance data to determine the potential of the performance tests for VVSG conformance tests. 
•	Identify future research to further enhance the usability performance requirements for accessible voting systems. 
In order to conduct this research, the Contractor must have the following the qualifications: extensive experience testing systems for accessibility, performing usability testing with test participants who have disabilities, knowledge of human factors, usability, accessibility, and statistical analysis,  some knowledge and experience with usability and accessibility testing of voting systems (or similar kiosk-based systems).

<DESC>National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC for a project entitled “Hispanic Aging Survey Feasibility Study”.   Health disparity is defined as a marked difference or inequality in a health measure, such as disability or mortality, between two or more population groups.  These population groups may be based on race or ethnicity, gender, education, or other criteria.  This project establishes the instruments necessary to assess the initial health status of a sample of American of Latino Ancestry.  The Initial design of this study tests whether instruments similar to those used presently by the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of  Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study will apply to this group.  The goal of  this work is to examine the feasibility of extending the ethnic comparisons in HANDLS to Latinos, a minority group that is under-represented in Baltimore and excluded from the baseline HANDLS sampling design.  Initial measures will include a health screen for overall health, a health history summary, psycho-social indicators of psychological support and stress, health behaviors, and physical performance indicators.  These data will be collected in English or Spanish depending upon participants’ preferred primary language.  Materials will be translated from English into Spanish, and back-translated to insure the accuracy of contact and nuance.  All data collected will be preserved in electronic format.  Primary analyses will be performed in collaboration with HANDLS investigators, including comparisons with baseline HANDLS results.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide the expertise required to test the feasibility of extending the present HANDLS study materials to samples of American of Latino Ancestry.  This is a test of whether measures developed based for urban African Americans and whites generalized to English and Spanish speakers in semi-urban and rural areas.   This procurement will provide materials translated into Spanish and initial data for comparisons with existing baseline data from HANDLS.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 13,106-1(2)(b).  The cited authority is applicable because Wake Forest University is the only source that can fulfill the requirement of this contract.   They are an expert in cross-cultural bio-behavioral epidemiological studies that combine health status, functional status, and psycho-social inventories in multicultural settings in the United States and elsewhere.  They have published extensively on the influences of psychological measures on health outcomes in urban and rural minority samples.  A survey of the literature in this field and recommendations from investigators doing related research shows that there are no other sources for these services.  The period of performance is 12 months.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirements.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable source.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This equipment is for use on the HC-144A Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA).  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement and quotation that will be considered.  Anticipated date of award is 30 September 2008.

The U.S Coast Guard intends to procure a self-propelled or towed pallet loader that is air transportable and easily maintainable.  This pallet loader must be easily transportable on the US Coast Guard HC144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft (CN-235-300M) with the minimal set-up or adjustment to fit the cargo hold, preferably transported on the loading ramp itself, so as not to interfere with the load volume of the aircraft. The desired Pallet Loader would need to be easily adjustable for elevation to raise or lower the load and have load tie downs and an anchor system for air transportation. Loader would be used to transport and load and unload military pallets measuring 108” by 88” and the Mission System Pallet measuring 108” by 63” with varying weights. On the HC-144 these pallets load lengthwise.  Information on the CN-235 is available at WWW.eads.net.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.

 Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS <br />AIR COMPRESSOR <br />FA4830-08-Q-0063<br />20 AUG 2008
<p>QUESTION: Will bids for comparable equipment be considered, quote brand Ingersoll Rand instead of Curtis?<br />ANSWER : If someone can supply us with a suitable substitute instead of using aCurtis name brand that is fine as long as it meets our needs.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Is a receiver (tank) required? If so, would you like the<br />compressors tank-mounted, or base-mounted, with separate tank? If separate,do you want one or two receivers?<br />ANSWER: I believe we have a receiver tank for this system already in place.</p>
<p>QUESTION: If installation is required, will there be a site visit, or can<br />we get drawings of the installation?<br />ANSWER : Site visit is not necessary.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by potential vendor.

Question:  The spec states that you will be using an existing 2500 gallon storage tank.  I am looking for the Materials of construction, and the type of tank that exists (cone bottom, flat bottom etc.)?
Answer:  The tank is made of high density polyethylene and it has a flat bottom.

Question:  Where is the location of the system in the building (basement, ground floor, penthouse)?
Answer:  The system is on the ground floor.

Question:  What exactly is the water being used for, the end product usage patterns (is all the water being used at once, slowly over a 8hr. period, slowly over a 24hr. period, ect.), number of points of use, the distance of the points of use from the storage tank, pipe specifications of the polishing loop, and whether the loop piping is the responsibility of the vendor?
Answer:  The water is used in a facility that measures the volume contained in test measures. We want pure water so that we can know its density by making a measurement of temperature alone. The relationship between temperature and density is well known for pure water and if the water has the specified purity, we will be able to calculate the density from the temperature with sufficient accuracy.  The water usage varies widely. On occasions the entire 2500 gallon tank will be used in a single day of testing. Other times, the water will sit in the 2500 gallon tank unused for many consecutive weeks.  The water is presently used at two points about 20 feet from the 2500 gallon tank.  There is presently no polishing loop and the installation of the loop is the vendors responsibility.

Question:  The spec states that the incoming feed water has a conductivity > of 2100 ohm/cm.  Ohm/cm is a measure of resistivity, is this number resistivity or conductivity?
Answer:  The resistivity of the incoming feed water is 2100 ohm * cm.

All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date, remain unchanged and in full effect.

4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought synopsis isalso attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar 08 forsubmittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no other changes to the requirements for submittals.

4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought synopsis isalso attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar 08 forsubmittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no other changes to the requirements for submittals.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to allow for an additional 5 days in accordance with FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a purchase order to Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), 11720 Beltsville Drive, Ste. 900, Calverton, MD 20705. The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 6.302-1 and FAR Part 13.106-1. The contractor shall develop medical care cost estimates for injury-related deaths, hospitalizations and emergency department visits which will be made available to the public. Justification for other than full and open competition is because contractors do not have the data or the experience needed to perform this analysis. PIRE has the proprietary injury cost model required. This is not a request for competitive proposals and a solicitation is not available. Firms that believe they can provide these services/supplies are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contract Specialist prior to the response date found in this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Lynn Walling by email at lqw5@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2670.</p>

DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of high-throughput chemical analysis of trace gases.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.

DARPA- BAA-08-62, entitled Panoptic Analysis of Chemical Traces (PACT), is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest, the submission process, proposal formats, as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.

Administrative, technical, or contractual questions should be sent via email to DARPA-BAA-08-62@darpa.mil. All requests must include the name, address, and phone number of a point of contact.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Systems Operations Contract Division, HQ, Washington, DC, proposes to issue a requirement for the acquisition of multiple types of surge protective devices (SPD)/transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS).  The purpose of the devices is to limit transient over voltages and divert surge currents appearing on FAA power distribution networks.
The type of contract contemplated under this requirement is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract consisting of a one year base period plus 4-one year options.  All prices are requested on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis.  The desired delivery is FOB: Destination based on the estimated quantities listed under the Schedule.  This acquisition is being procured as a 100 percent Small Business Set-Aside.
The SPD/TVSS proposed under this requirement consist of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items.  The specifications establish the requirements for 60 Hz AC devices used for transient protection of FAA power distribution systems.  The procurement of all new and replacement SPD/TVSS by the FAA shall be in accordance with the specifications set forth under the Screening Information Request (SIR).  (Note: This SIR contains provisions for a First Article Testing (FAT).    
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335999; Surge Suppression Manufacturing.  The corresponding size standard in number of employees is 500.
The anticipated issue date of the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) is 7 July 2008, with a revised scheduled closing date of 9 September 2008.  A copy of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer can be located at: http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm, on/or about the issue date noted above.

The FAA, through the Office of Runway Safety, intends to enter into Funded Cooperative Agreements with users who agree to equip their aircraft with equipment which can display approved Airport Moving Maps or with equipment approved to provide aural situational awareness runway information to pilots.
The amount of funding awarded will be determined by the type of equipment being installed and the number of aircraft receiving the equipment and which airports and how often the proposer will be operating the equipped fleet.  In return for receiving federal funds the users will agree to equip their aircraft within a certain time frame and participate in the evaluation detailed in the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP).
Multiple awards are possible.  The FAA estimates the total of all awards will not exceed $5,000,000.00.  The FAA currently has $2 million available to award, but may award additional cooperative agreements as funding becomes available.
Proposals are solicited in accordance with the documents herein.

<CONTACT>Terry Frederick, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-7043, Fax 301-827-7106, Email terry.frederick@fda.hhs.gov - Lee L Cohen, Supervisory Contracting Officer  , Phone 301-827--7046, Fax 301-827-7106, Email lee.cohen@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA is issuing this Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify, describe, and evaluate potential U.S. orthopedic implant registries that could participate to create a national network of such registries for the FDA in support of the Sentinel Initiative.  The implants of interest would include, but are not limited to, total hip, total knee, hip resurfacing, intervertebral disk implants, and ankle devices


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic registries, electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential data sources that might be included in the Sentinel Initiative.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification, description, and evaluation of potential U.S. orthopedic implant registries that could participate to create a national network of such registries as part of the Sentinel Initiative.  The implants of interest would include, but are not limited to, total hip, total knee, hip resurfacing, intervertebral disk implants, and ankle devices.
 
This work will require a thorough analysis of each registry’s: (1) scope, content, structure,  quality, and timeliness of data; (2) patient population(s), duration of follow-up and capture of care across all settings; (3) plans for further registry enhancements; (4) availability, experience and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for surveillance of post-market product performance; (5) availability, experience and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; (7) view of working with professional societies in creating a distributed network; and (8) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for further involvement of the most promising data sources and/or environments as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.  It should also include a value proposition and engagement strategy for registry owners and professional societies.

The Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The award type will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is “Full and Open.”  The Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award will be “Best Value.”

The primary location of performance will be at the contractor’s preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is: 541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.

This announcement is an active RFQ.  The quotation due date is September 2, 2008, at 10:00 AM, ET.  The anticipated award date is on or around September 18, 2008.

The work requires the identification, description, and evaluation of potential data sources and/or data environments that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data source’s: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated drugs, biologics (excluding blood and tissue products), and devices; (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow up and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for post-market product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; and (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing this Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify and evaluate population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products in furtherance of FDA’s Sentinel Initiative.

Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. There is a particular need to evaluate the feasibility of these data sources to study blood and tissue products.  Many blood products are administered parenterally in outpatient stand alone clinics or infusion centers, settings that are beyond traditional inpatient hospital-based services.  Because of these and other varied settings of administration (blood centers, inpatient, ambulatory surgery, outpatient prescription, etc.), accurate identification of blood product utilization will require access to data sources beyond traditional prescription or inpatient claims surveys currently available to FDA.  Likewise, useful data sources will require particular capabilities to identify infections and other adverse events in recipients of human tissue products, which may be implanted in inpatient settings, dental offices, or ambulatory surgical settings, and are not usually inventoried in typical inpatient or outpatient pharmacy systems. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential Sentinel Initiative data sources in studying blood and tissue product safety.  

The primary goals are to evaluate the ability of the potential data sources and/or environments to:

(1)  Evaluate the safety of blood and tissue products.
(a) Measure blood and tissue product usage including, but not limited to, amounts, frequencies, and indications, as well as demographics and clinical characteristics of recipients.  Enrolled populations should be representative of the US population, and usage should be comprehensive enough to cover the varied clinical indications, care settings (inpatient, outpatient, infusion center, etc.), and product types for blood and tissue products.
(b) Calculate incidence rates of adverse events by linking blood and tissue uses to subsequent patient healthcare claims.
(c) Evaluate potential risk factors for developing adverse events.
(d) Assess if adverse outcomes are attributable to the administered blood or tissue product (e.g., if rates are higher than expected based on analysis of appropriate comparison group)

(2) Accurately identify exposures (procedures involving tissue or blood products) and outcomes (infections and other adverse events of interest) in covered patients, and validate these data.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification and evaluation of population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products.

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data source’s: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated blood and tissue products (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up, and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for blood and tissue product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; and (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific evaluations of the feasibility to conduct safety related studies for blood and tissue products in each data source.

The Period of Performance will be Six Months from date of award.  The award type will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is “Full and Open.”  The Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award will be “Best Value.”

The primary location of performance will be at the contractor’s preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is: 541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.

This announcement is an active RFQ.  The quotation due date is September 2, 2008, at 10:00 AM, ET.  The anticipated award date is on or around September 18, 2008.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing this Request for Quotations (RFQ) to define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in FDA’s Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.

Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.  

The awardee will be required to complete the following tasks:

(1.) Develop a comprehensive requirements document detailing actual user needs for monitoring medical product performance throughout its entire life cycle in order to protect and promote the public health. 

(2.) Define possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative.  This should include, but not be limited to, distributed and federated models.  The list of models to be defined should be developed in consultation with the Agency.

(3.) Compare and contrast the identified database models with the user needs documented in the detailed requirements documents.  Characterize the advantages and disadvantages of the models identified in #2 for the intended use of postmarketing surveillance as envisioned by the Sentinel Initiative.  Evaluate issues related to policy, performance, privacy and security, robustness of findings, benefits to all stakeholders, and data standards.  This requirement should be fulfilled by consulting with all the various stakeholder groups that will be represented in the public-private partnership formed for the implementation of the Sentinel Initiative.    

(4.) Identify and evaluate existing data sources and/or environments that operate under each model.  Describe the content, quality, flexibility, and timeliness of each system, as well as how each could best contribute to the Sentinel Network.

The Period of Performance will be Six Months from date of award.  The award type will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is “Full and Open.”  The Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the Basis of Award will be “Best Value.”

<DESC><p>This modification is to develop an alternate compressor design/source for the BRU-61/A carriage. The Government's need for an alternate source of supply for a high-pressure air compressor system stems from reliability, maintainability, and serviceability issues with the current system. Failures of the current system have resulted in reduced operational capability, increased repair actions, and low user confidence in SDB mission success.</p>
