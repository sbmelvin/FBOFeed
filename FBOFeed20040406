<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for development of additional capabilities to thruster plume and effects models that provide a detailed quantitative assessment of the critical issues associated with interactions of plumes from multiple ion engines with each other. This will be accomplished through follow-on research and development to enhance and expand the NASA/Air Force Spacecraft Charging Analysis Program (NASCAP-2K) and Electric Propulsion Interactions Code (EPIC) for utilization by the JIMO flight project. This inlcudes continued development of EPIC to enhance the plume and effects models and incorporate 3-dimensional analysis capability of high-energy thruster plumes and the capability to perform future trade studies. New capabilities will be added to NASCAP-2K that, along with the new EPIC capabilities, will provide complete capability to address the unique JIMO spacecraft charging issues. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego, California, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for the acquisition of supplies or services from only one source. The effort is a follow-on to 2 previous NASA contracts with SAIC, which began the development of the thruster plume and effects models contained in EPIC and NASCAP-2K for the Space Environments and Effects Program. Currently, software that provides 3-dimensional capability of high-energy thruster beams (5KeV each) is not available. Therefore, it is practical for the government to obtain this capability by expanding the existing EPIC software, which currently combines existing plume models along with an object toolkit for spacecraft geometry into a design tool for lower thruster plume levels such as the Hall thruster. Also, the base architecture and specific numerical algorithms of NASCAP-2K are proprietary to SAIC. SAIC is the only known source that possesses the existing tools, technical knowledge, and experience to upgrade and continue the technical content research and model development. The government has invested a substantial amount over 5 years of effort toward the development of these programs and technical content research, most of which would have to be duplicated by another source to develop the technical expertise to continue the research. SAIC personnel possess a steadfast understanding of technology needs, requirements, and expertise of this research field that was obtained through other contracted efforts addressing spacecraft charging issues for the International Space Station and the Mercury Messenger Mission. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. See note 22. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 21, 2004. See note 25 for description of the information that must be provided. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon the information submitted in response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the development of a space transportation vehicle reconfigurable control allocation (CA)   algorithm capable of adapting to vehicle health information. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Auburn University and pursuant to FAR 13.106.  This action is justified because Auburn University has already developed for a robust control allocation (CA) algorithm that has potental applicability to a wide range of non-linear control problems.  This effort will complete the algorithm partially developed under a previous NRA8-30 contract with NASA/MSFC. It has benefit to all potential space exploration vehicles, from earth-to-orbit launch vehicles, in-space transfer stages and planetary landers. In addition, the continued development of the algorithm has the potential for significant cost and safety benefits for future space exploration vehicle systems. The requirement is for the development of a reconfigurable control allocation law to enable flight software to recognize and adapt to vehicle health status, whether informed by external signals  or by its own internal adaptive Kalman filter. Improvements to the CA algorithm code design process shall give a traceable structure so that problems in flight tests (simulations) can be traced back to a set of gains for reconfiguration purposes.  In addition, the computational overhead and memory requirements shall be in line with flight-like computer systems.  Both "on-line" and "off-line" CA capabilities shall be developed. The period of performance is for 12 months.  Deliverables include:  1)  CA algorithm code in C, integrated in the Maveric simulation.  Each algorithm shall have a verbal description of the changes; written is preferred but not required. 2)  Final written reports of the theory and algorithm implementation.  3)  Training of civil service personnel, in the form of a 1 to 2 hour presentation at or near the end of the contract period.  4)  Reviews as required.     Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Jennifer B.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for services. The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation BLS-04-16, is being issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ)  in accordance to FAR Part 13. 

DESCRIPTION:

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) requires additional empirical evidence to improve the measures of capital used in measuring ìmultifactor productivityî (MFP).  BLS is seeking to fund several proposals for small research projects that would identify and exploit new data sources to improve the assumptions made in the measurement process.  The projects will be presented as research papers at a conference in Washington, DC, tentatively scheduled for September 16, 2005.  After the conference, the Journal of Productivity Analysis anticipates a special issue that will independently review and select for publication some papers from this conference as well as other submissions that are not funded by BLS.             

Improvements in the design of new capital goods, and the sheer accumulation of capital goods, can raise productivity.  To understand economic growth it is important to have good measures of capital.  BLS measures MFP using a neoclassical productivity model, in the tradition of work by Solow, Jorgenson, and many others.   As with any economic measure, many assumptions must be made in capital measurement.  However, the role of capital in production is particularly complex.  There is uncertainty, at the time assets are produced, about the pattern of returns they will provide in the future.  For most types of assets, rigid assumptions are typically made about the patterns of services and returns to assets.  These assumptions are often based on a few parameters derived from evidence that is either out of date or that relates to other types of assets.

II.  Scope of research projects that will be considered.

There are a number of specific areas where BLS requires better information:

-	Service lives, i.e., the length of the period that assets spend in the service of businesses or households.
-	Patterns of utilization of assets during their lifetimes, e.g., data on the intensity with which they are used, such as number of hours they are in service and the amount of output they generate.  There are issues of how these variables behave during the business cycle as well as with the age of the asset.   
-	The behavior of asset rental prices (revenues less cost associated with particular assets) with age and/or over the business cycle.   
-	The behavior of asset purchase prices.
-	Changes in the characteristics or ìqualityî of new capital goods.  Little effort has been made to base quality adjustments on rental prices, the basis suggested in capital theory, instead of on asset prices.
-	The factors that influence service lives, utilization, and depreciation, such as physical decay (which may cause down-time or increased maintenance cost), obsolescence, the business cycle, or the growth rate of the industry employing the assets.  
-	Land values.  Present land value measures rest on heroic assumptions.  Evidence on the value of land relative to the value of structures would be useful.  Time series data that differentiated by industry or otherwise by type of land-use would be most useful.  (Data might be based on hedonic studies conducted by the authors.  Alternatively, good estimates may be available from tax assessment databases, provided the assessments are based on sophisticated methods.)  
-	Inventory depreciation or other price changes.
-	Assets that are used in specific industries as well as assets that are found throughout the economy. 

Although the primary focus will be on new data sources for tangible business assets, other topics that improve the empirical basis for capital measurement would be of interest.  For example, new evidence on the role of intangible capital, human capital, or consumer durables would be of interest, as would be studies that use micro data to help identify how company-based capital data might be used in developing capital time series for establishment-based industry productivity studies.

The use of data sources that have not been used previously in capital measurement work is paramount.  The data may be obtained from private sources or they may be tabulated from public notices, such as advertised prices.  The selection and use of advanced econometric techniques will be important to extracting information on relationships and parameters that are useful to the BLS capital and multifactor productivity measures.  If there are issues relating to protecting the confidentiality of the data provider, the contractor must raise these issues in the proposal so that the BLS and the contractor can evaluate potential legal issues and potential limitations to the study before the contract is awarded.     

III.  Work Plan

The proposal shall specify the types of assets, industries, and/or types of issues (see Section II for the scope of issues) that will be examined.  The proposal shall also describe which data source(s) will be developed and how it will be used.  A successful proposal shall describe a project that would significantly benefit the goals of improving the BLS MFP measures and that would represent a significant and novel contribution to the literature on the subject of capital measurement.  The proposal shall include the curriculum vita of the principal investigator.

Each contractor shall obtain the data, analyze the data, and write up the results in a format suitable for sharing with academic peers.  It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to obtain the data for the proposed project.  The preliminary report shall be submitted to BLS no later than April, 2005.  This report shall present tabulations demonstrating that the contractor has the data and has control of the data in an analytic software package and it shall clarify the directions of the project.  After receiving this report, BLS will provide feedback on the most useful directions for the analysis.  A research paper shall be submitted to the BLS no later than August 19, 2005 so that BLS officials, conference participants, and a discussant will have an opportunity to read it before the conference.  Either the contractor or the contractorís representative shall attend the conference and make an oral presentation about the findings.  The BLS, at its discretion, may ask for additional analysis or revisions to the paper.  These revisions may be to address any of several possible issues, such as improving the usefulness of the results to the BLS, addressing econometric issues raised by the discussant or other specialists who attend the conference, or acknowledging editorial comments.  The revised paper, along with an executive summary of approximately two pages, will constitute the final report.  This will be due no later than September 30, 2005. 

IV.  Period of Performance

The contract period shall be one year from the date of award.  The projected date of the award is September 15, 2004.  

V.  Deliverables

The following deliverables shall be completed within the timeframe stated below:

Final report                                                                    September 30, 2005  


VI.  Funding

BLS intends to make multiple awards under $25,000.  The contractor shall submit a cost breakdown for all costs, such as travel, costs for data, etc. 


VII.  Selection Criteria

Proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:

1)  The relevance of the data source to U.S. business sector capital.  The Bureau will consider questions such as: How significant are the assets being evaluated?  How representative are the observations available from the data source of the general population of assets?  How many variables are there upon which to gauge the physical use and value of assets as they age?  Are there panel qualities to the data as well as cross section?  What is the quality of the data to be used in the study?  (20 points)

2)  The quality of the analytic framework.  For example: Are the econometric tests or statistics that are proposed appropriate?  Will the study likely be viewed as a contribution to the literature on economic measurement?  Will the study be likely to identify variables in a way that will be useful in estimating U.S. business sector capital.   (20 points)

3)  The number of issues are addressed by the full set of proposals.  The Bureau prefers that each study encompass a different topic.  If multiple proposals are on very similar topics then the best one will be given preference and the others will be less likely to be selected relative to proposals on different topics. (10 points)

4)  The feasibility of the plan of study described in the proposal.  The Bureau will judge whether the proposal describes an area of study that can be completed in the time frame allowed and with the funds available.      (10 points)

5)  Experience of the contractor.  The Bureau will review the contractorís past publications of studies using econometric tools to do empirical analysis.  (20 points)

6)  Cost of project.  The cost of the project will be assessed relative to the scope and difficulty of the proposed project.  A less difficult project may be funded if it is of value and if its cost is in line with its difficulty.  (20 POINTS)

<DESC>Description:  SUBJECT: Airborne Geophysical Reconnaissance DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Furgro Airborne Surveys, Houston, TX for the purchase an airborne geophysical reconnaissance of selected coalbed methane producing areas of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.  The following is the statement of work. The contractor will conduct a helicopter, frequency domain electromagnetic and magnetic survey of selected areas in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.  A total of approximately 1245 ln-km are to be flown in the following areas:  (1) Fidelity ? 207 ln-km; (2) Burger Draw (100m line spacing) 381; (3) Burger Draw (50m line spacing) 105; (4) LX Bar 322: and (5) Penn Pitts 230. The contractor will supply all equipment, supplies, and personnel needed to complete this mission.  The electromagnetic survey system shall have coplanar (vertical dipole) coil pairs operating at a minimum of five frequencies that range from about 400 Hz to 140 Hz.  Data collected during these surveys shall be smoothed and leveled by the contractor and provided to NETL in electronic form.  These data are to be provided on CD or DVD media and are to include: (1)  Conductivity maps for each area and for each frequency in .ers file format;  (2)  Leveled in-phased and quadrature data in XYZ data format; and (3) Occam and differential depth inversions for one flight line from each area (flight line to be selected at a later date).  End of statement of work. This purchase order is being issued to Fugro Airborne Surveys because the initial survey of these areas was performed by Fugro Airborne Surveys in 2003; identical equipment must be used for the follow up survey to assure that when the two surveys are compared, the observed differences reflect environmental, hydrological, or geological changes and not equipment failures.  Only the RESOLVE system used exclusively by Fugro Airborne Surveys has five frequencies with a high frequency that is greater than 100 kHz.  This capability is needed to resolve conductivity variations in the near-surface which are indicative of soil moisture and salt content.  The ability to detect differences in the moisture and slat content of the root zone brought about by the application of coalbed-methane produced water is necessary for the success of this project. The RESOLVE system has a maximum frequency of 140 kHz, which is ideal; the only other airborne EM system with five or more frequencies, the Geophex GEM 2a, is limited to a maximum  frequency of 50 kHz. This request is considered to be sole source to Fugro Airborne Surveys. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Richard Hammack. All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, April 10, 2004.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Maine Field Station is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with W. F. Baird and Associates to develop a customized software system to provide environmental data (minimum requirements are water temperature, salinity, tide height, directional velocity, and bathymetry) at a 25 meter grid resolution or less that corresponds directly to the time and location of smolt movements (measured, interpolated, or assumed) in the study area.  The Atlantic salmon are part of a population segment listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.  Gaining a better understanding of the environmental conditions these fish encounter and site-specific conditions associated with mortality is a critical research need.  The development of the software system by Baird and Associates will work with the existing infrastructure of database and GIS software systems and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary work with 1997-1998 and 2002-2003 datasets.  The contract for this software is a follow-on to a previous software project successfully implemented by Baird and Associates.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by April 20, 2004.    Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

Under the past performance evaluation criteria, the evaluation of an offeror's present and past work record will be performed to assess the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including cost and schedule.  Evaluation of the offerors past performance will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an Offeror's relevant present and recent past performance, focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to this effort.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, and/or teaming partners, will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror.

Offerors are hereby advised that only those proposals determined to have a reasonable chance for award of a contract will be included in the competitive range.  While every effort will be made to maintain strong competition, the Contracting Officer will also look to eliminate time consuming and unnecessary discussions with those offerors whose proposals have no reasonable chance for award.  This procedure is considered beneficial to both the Air Force and the offerors involved since, in addition to saving further expenditure of resources, acquisition lead time should be reduced.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions.  The contractor shall provide at a minimum a spreadsheet listing all labor categories, hourly rates and extended labor costs.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS evolved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   Phase II of the project incorporated new data into the model, integrated methods to acquire subject matter expert data, developed system-scaling requirements, continued development of display method, and demonstrated the model.  Phase II devised methods of distributing cultural elements throughout the CSM structures thereby forming an open system allowing inclusion of data from the multiple perspective of various disciplines.  CSM development effectively balanced technical and contextual needs of threat anticipation with the ease of use and understand of the end user.   Phase III of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  Phase III will result in a computer simulation model capable of receiving live electronic data, modeling cultural interactions between multiple individuals, and displaying the results of the computations to analysts.  Phase III will provide a CSM capable of calculating interactions with the intent of anticipating threats.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS.

<DESC>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Applications branch of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Technology Development Directorate develops WMD counterforce planning tools, weapons, and assessment system technologies; demonstrates prototype systems in operationally realistic environments; supports warfighters in defining concepts of operations; and provides combatant commanders with enhanced capabilities from development through production.  

The approach of this draft WMD Counterforce Combat Assessment Capabilities (CAC) Request For Proposal (RFP) consists of a two-spiral, rolling down-select (a.k.a ìfly-offî).  In Spiral One (SP1), DTRA anticipates to award two contracts with a set of options for: the second Spiral (SP2) development; additional systems development & demonstration (SDD), if required; production; sustainment; and, operations support.  There are two biological warfare agent collection technologies of interest to DTRA, wet/dry cyclone and regular/virtual impactor.  DTRA intends to award a contract for each type of collection technology and will use the SP1 operational demonstration to down-select. 

The Industry Day / Pre-proposal conference is being scheduled for 27 April 2004, 0800-1200, at the Northrop Grumman Integrated Technologies Office at 6940 South Kings Highway, Alexandria, Virginia 22310.  This conference will be held at the SECRET level.  Companies desiring to attend this meeting shall contact the Government representatives identified below and shall provide the names, security clearances, and contact information (telephone, email, etc.).  Each company shall be limited to 3-individuals attending this conference.

As a part of the conference, DTRA is scheduling a series of one-on-one meetings whereby interested respondents will have the opportunity to ask questions and clarify points of the WMD Counterforce Applications CAC RFP that they do not wish to express in a public forum.  The following dates are established for respondents to this solicitation: April 27th and 28th 2004 (April 29th is being held in reserve should additional times be required).

<CONTACT>Timothy Cichon, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4083, Fax 407-380-4164, Email Timothy.Cichon@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR-Orlando) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a delivery order under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO. under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  As the design cognizant activity and builder of the in production F/A-18 E/F Aircraft, Boeing alone maintains the engineering expertise required to design, build and deliver high fidelity F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers to meet critical fleet training requirement deadlines.  The Boeing Company through their Flight Simulation division is funded by the F/A-18 E/F Aircraft Program to create aircraft systems software and modify aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) software for engineering simulations at Boeing that are used in the development of the F/A-18 E/F aircraft.  These newly created and modified OFP software models are then reused in the development of F/A-18 E/F trainer systems.  As part of the aircraft procurement program, Boeing developed and built the current F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and are currently responsible for design, fabrication, integration, documentation, shipping, installation and testing of the Block 2 upgrades to specific trainers.  This sole source procurement will be for the procurement of four (4) low fidelity trainers, which will be used to support F/A-18 E/F Block 2 aircrew training while upgrades to existing high fidelity trainers are being completed. Utilizing a full-size cockpit and a sub-set of functional cockpit controls, these re-configurable Low Fidelity Trainers will be capable of providing simulation of a Lot 26/H2E configured F/A-18F aircraft to meet the objectives required for effective training of the Advanced Crew Station upgrade. Boeing will be responsible for fabrication and integration of the Block 2 configuration into Boeingís existing low fidelity trainer design.  The delivery of the devices will have to be accomplished by approximately January 2005.  Additionally, the Government has restricted and limited rights on certain noncommercial computer software and noncommercial software documentation and noncommercial technical data; therefore, the Government is unable to provide this information.  Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current aircraft design, Block 2 Configuration upgrade currently being incorporated in to the trainers, and the design of the trainers, award through competition would require substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the F/A-18 E/F's mission training requirements scheduled for January 2005.  To meet timeframes, milestones, and schedules, Boeing has established relationships with key personnel, and has successfully designed, fabricated, integrated, and delivered F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and demonstrated the capability to perform the required effort.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Tim Cichon (timothy.cichon@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2000, no later than April 21, 2004.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE (5) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  If no affirmative written response is received, the delivery order for the trainer devices will be awarded without further notice.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) in a procurement for the generation of statistical analysis reports. These reports will be primarily based on 5 visitor surveys administered by the Contractor at the National Archives Building, Washington, D.C., over a two year period.  Visitors will be surveyed following the opening of each new component of the National Archives Experience (NAE) to take advantage of this unique opportunity to determine how each new venue changes behaviors and attitudes, especially corresponding to length of stay, visitor satisfaction, and visitor priorities. The results of the survey will be used to make adjustments in our service offerings that will improve the overall visitor experience.
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides public programming at the National Archives Building in Washington, DC.  Over the next two years a number of new venues will open, which are designed to enhance the visitorsí experience and are collectively referred to as the NAE. The NAE encompasses all of the general visitor venues in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, but excludes the research facilities in that building.  The NAE includes the following elements to be surveyed according to the dates below:
The Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom (opened September 17, 2003)
The William G. McGowan Theater at the National Archives (opening September 2004)
The Public Vaults (permanent exhibit, opening November 2004)
The Learning Center (opening Winter 2005)
Special Exhibition Gallery (first traveling exhibit opening Fall 2005)

The contract awarded as a result of this RFQ will be a Firm-Fixed Price supply contract. The contract is for the supply of possibly 6 statistical analysis reports that would be delivered over a period of approximately 2 calendar years. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million. All responsible small business sources may submit a quote that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFQ, which will be available on or about March 18, 2004, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the Offerorís responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any. All Contractors interested in receiving notification of updates/amendments to the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps are urged to enroll on the web site mailing list for this acquisition. Those Contractors enrolled will be notified automatically of any changes made to the RFQ through their e-mail addresses. No telephone or fax RFQ request will be accepted. *****

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>3584
<RESPDATE>042004
<CONTACT>Tim Eckert, 202-385-8454
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has an upcoming requirement for an Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) contractor to support the Government's procurement of the Traffic Flow Management-Modernization (TFM-M) system.  Projected award date of this IV&V contract is October 30, 2004, with a period of performance running for one (1) year plus four (4) one-year options.  Contract type is anticipated to be Time-and-Materials. This market survey is being conducted in order to determine if adequate highly technical sources exist to set-aside the competition for small businesses or for eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are 8(a) certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  All small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and women-owned small businesses, as well as 8(a) certified businesses, are encouraged to participate in this survey.  In order to make a determination, the FAA requests a Capability Statement from each interested vendor.  Each Capability Statement copy shall be provided to the Government in a separate notebook, with each section (1 - 6) clearly tabbed.  Five (5) copies shall be submitted for evaluation.  The Capability Statement shall contain the information identified below in items 1 - 6.    1. Past Performance summary - This statement should identify past performance references for the last three years for work performed of a similar type to that in the attached Statement of Work(limited to 5 pages).  2.Resumes - These should be provided for those individuals expected to be identified as key personnel in a future proposal(limited to program manager, two software engineers, and two test engineers) (limited to 3 pages per resume). 3. Programmatic approaches (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.). (limited to 1 page) 4. Eligibility - If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  NOTE - A minimum of 51% of the effort must be performed by the prime contractor.  Teaming is encouraged. (limited to 2 pages) 5. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  6. If applicable, a copy of the vendors 8(a) Certification Form.   This should include all the required signatures and expiration dates.  The draft Statement of Work (SOW), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs), and Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) are attached.  Your input is sought to determine if you have the expertise, interest, and capabilities to perform the tasks described in these documents. Submitted Capability Statements will be reviewed for technical acceptability.  Additional work may be identified as new systems are developed or as needed due to organizational changes.  Cost information is not required at this time. Conflict of Interest: Regarding the possible participation of a contractor as a prime or subcontractor for this acquisition who is also a prime or subcontractor on the TFM-M contract which is due to be awarded by June 30, 2004, a conflict of interest may exist as described under the FAA's Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) at http://fast.faa.gov/procurement_guide/html/3-1-7.htm as "Impaired Objectivity".  Offerors will have the opportunity to present plans to mitigate any such conflicts of interest as specified in that FAAAMS reference, or any other possible conflicts of interest.  Such a plan would need to be submitted in response to the TFM-M IV & V RFO/SIR, scheduled to be issued in July, 2004. This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or promise of a contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.  A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey will not result in its exclusion from the competition.  The lack of adequate, technically qualified, socially and economically disadvantaged business (8(a) certified), or other small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition, open to large businesses.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAIC) for this effort would be 54168 (Other Management Consulting Services) ($6.0 million).  Your response must be submitted not later than April 20, 2004, noon local time.  The Capability Statements (five copies) may be hand-carried or mailed via Federal Express to Tim Eckert, Contracting Officer, Federal Aviation Administration,  800 Independence Avenue (if mailed) or 600 Independence Avenue (if hand-carried), Washington DC, 20591.  Late submissions will not be considered.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for supplemental fishery observer services.  The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples.  Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation.  This data, which cannot be obtained either dockside or while aboard Government research vessels, is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from New York to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in cramped quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities.  Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals.  Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government anticipates award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type of contract with a period of performance of one year.  The anticipated issue date for the solicitation is March 15, 2004 with a closing date on or about April 2, 2004. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. Neither telephone requests nor inquiries will be accepted in response to this notice.  All written inquiries must be received not later than ten days prior to closing date of solicitation.  Requests for copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Numbered note 1 applies. THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO FORWARD AMENDMENT NO. 0003 WHICH EXTENDS THE DUE DATE TO 2:00 P.M. ON 4/9/2004.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III) ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					5 Apr 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Request for Information Parts and  Repair Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: Our goal is to develop an acquisition strategy that allows us  to achieve outstanding performance while significantly reducing our cost of  doing business with a manageable level of risk.  While we welcome your input  throughout the acquisition process, your suggestions and comments will be  especially valuable as we develop our acquisition strategy.   2.  BACKGROUND:  Program Title The Parts and Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) is a service contract managed  by the Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC). It is available to satisfy  logistics requirements for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  PROS II  provides a capability to purchase a wide range of nonstandard and difficult to  support standard parts and maintenance services.  PROS II also provides a  vehicle for contracting for specialized engineering and technical services  through task orders. Contract Effort Description The PROS II Program functions much the same as an Air Logistics Center.  The  contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance  services and the management of task orders.  The contract is managed by a  dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractorís performance  and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS II are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide ìone stop shoppingî for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 ñ Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. Note: See chart one for how the PROS II program process works.  SAMIS stands  for Security Assistance Management Information System. Developmental Phase PROS III the Follow-on to PROS II  We are entering the developmental phase of the follow-on to PROS II.   Chart Two Explanation Chart shows PR (purchase request) being offered up to contractors A and B (1)  for competitive supply/maintenance fill action.  Contractors A and B in competition with each other go to their OEM partners or  competitive vendors (2) for quotes. Price and Lead Time (LT) are provided to the USAF by contractors A and B (3)  and the USAF then selects the best offer (4). The contractor (A or B) with the best offer receives the order (5) and they  issue a contract (6) with the appropriate vendor. Shipment is made as quoted (7) and services charges are paid (8). Winner takes all.  The loosing contractor receives no recompense for their  efforts unless they win an award to fill an order. Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings ñ best available price ñ minimizing participation fees Turn around time ñ shortest possible lead-time ñ lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Possible options include, but would not be limited to, multiple award and other  Governmental agencies receiving orders with respect to contractor B. Goal Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.  We are  soliciting comments from industry on the attached approach (chart two) with  regard to feasibility, suggested incentives and interest in PROS III  participation. 3. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not  constitute a solicitation.  The RFI shall not be construed as an obligation on  the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government  does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI and all  information shall be made available at not cost to the Government.  Responses  to the RFI will not be returned.   4. If you are interested in this effort, please provide comments and any  additional information to this office (Attn: Jim Dinwoody) by COB 30 April  2004.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS evolved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   Phase II of the project incorporated new data into the model, integrated methods to acquire subject matter expert data, developed system-scaling requirements, continued development of display method, and demonstrated the model.  Phase II devised methods of distributing cultural elements throughout the CSM structures thereby forming an open system allowing inclusion of data from the multiple perspective of various disciplines.  CSM development effectively balanced technical and contextual needs of threat anticipation with the ease of use and understand of the end user.   Phase III of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  Phase III will result in a computer simulation model capable of receiving live electronic data, modeling cultural interactions between multiple individuals, and displaying the results of the computations to analysts.  Phase III will provide a CSM capable of calculating interactions with the intent of anticipating threats.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS.

<DESC>The following synopsis is corrected to change the year for receipt of cabability statements.  Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS evolved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   Phase II of the project incorporated new data into the model, integrated methods to acquire subject matter expert data, developed system-scaling requirements, continued development of display method, and demonstrated the model.  Phase II devised methods of distributing cultural elements throughout the CSM structures thereby forming an open system allowing inclusion of data from the multiple perspective of various disciplines.  CSM development effectively balanced technical and contextual needs of threat anticipation with the ease of use and understand of the end user.   Phase III of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  Phase III will result in a computer simulation model capable of receiving live electronic data, modeling cultural interactions between multiple individuals, and displaying the results of the computations to analysts.  Phase III will provide a CSM capable of calculating interactions with the intent of anticipating threats.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties have fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this Synopsis, to submit in writing, to the identified point of contact, clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities. Such qualifications and/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Some demolition work of existing buildings containing asbestos and lead based paint.  The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $4,500,000 and $5,500,000.  The design and construction requires completion in approximately 425 days.  Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design-build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.  Only those Offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price, such as, base proposal, options, and evaluation of scope-design options within the Governments published budget for award. The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel and Technical Solution.  The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. The Government intends to issue the Phase I Request for Proposals, RFP, electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about 09 February 2004. Offerors must register on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<RESPDATE>042304
<ARCHDATE>04062005
<CONTACT>MARGARET EASTMAN CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487366     mrussell@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request for Information (RFI); neither a draft statement of work nor specifications are available.  The information received will be used as part of a market survey.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid; merely a request for information. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in exploring "508 compliant" web based technologies and solutions that can help the organization manage safety, health and environmental program assessments and compliance audits, and subsequent tracking of identified deficiencies or areas of non-compliance through abatement, and Environmental Management System (EMS) implementation, based on Federal OSHA 1910/1926/1960; EPA 40 and DOT 49 Code of Federal Regulations.  The subject application(s) should include flexibility for tailoring to include Department of the Interior and USGS requirements and standards in each of the applications as mentioned herein, with technical support provided by the contractor.   The USGS prefers a single application where USGS personnel can get any information need to execute and manage agency-wide environmental and safety programs served on a single centralized web-server but will entertain COTS applications that fulfill most of the requirements below.  The application will support both Netscape version 4.7 (or later) and Microsoft (MS) Internet Explorer version 5.0 (or later) browsers along with MS and Apple operating systems.  Java Scripts will be used to simplify web-based interfaces.  The application will have to pass a Certification and Accreditation evaluation based on the DOI Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Guide Version 1.1 (July 10, 2003.)  Access to various components of the site and /or specific permissions within each of components will be accomplished via user- and office-specific userid/passwords that limit individual users' authority.  With the user's individual userid/password they will be able to travel anywhere there is access to the World Wide Web and complete their work.  Web based client-server architecture will be based on Windows 2000 (or 2003) Server Operating System with Internet Information Server and Application Server using MS or Netscape client software. System functionality should include the following applications that support facility based organization, execution and management of:  	1) EMS, inclusive of conducting GAP analysis, identification of facility specific aspects/impacts, inclusive of tracking environmental remediation/liability locations and associated action plans/budget, EMS auditing/compliance and associated requirements and associated reports;  	2) Environmental Compliance Auditing related to EPA 40 series regulations and associated reports;  	3) Safety and Health Auditing related to OSHA 29 CFR 1960/1910/1926 and Department of Transportation 49 series regulations and associated reports;  	4) Hazard Abatement Plan, for tracking identified inspection findings of non-compliance and associated corrective action costs, through final abatement (for items 1-3 above) and associated reports;  	5) Management Trend Analysis Reports for inspection and abatement data at the local, regional or bureau level in tabular/graphical format;  	6) User Resources and References, for access to regulations and search capabilities by topic/word; and downloading of template programs, forms or link to other USGS information/portals.  Components 1-6 will be in a format that allows agency personnel to customize options and features of the program.  All reports should be downloadable in a word processor format in addition to print capability via the web. The USGS is interested in obtaining commercially available information from the vendor community on their capability to provide the above described commercial off-the-shelf software.  The response format should not exceed 10 pages inclusive of facts/figures.  The response should be prepared using Microsoft Word.  Questions and all responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Maggie Eastman, at mrussell@usgs.gov.  Responses are due no later than the close of business on April 23, 2004.  Any subsequent solicitation will by synopsized prior to its release.

<DESC>The U.S. Army ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting a Market Survey to determine the potential capabilities of the optical vacuum coating industry to produce laser eye protection filters for a variety of small arm fire control magnifying optical systems.  The filters will be mounted in threaded tubular assemblies; one end of the unit must interface with a specific optical sight, the other end must interface with a removable Anti Reflection Device (ARD) that is source controlled.  This survey is for three (3) categories of laser filter assemblies: low power magnifying riflescopes with apertures between 28 and 34mm; high power riflescopes with apertures between 40 and 50mm; and large aperture observation spotting scopes between 60 and 70mm.  A delivery rate estimate for filters, starting in CY05, is 600 per month that includes 200 of each of the above categories.  The specification for the optical laser filter is Government classified at the SECRET level.  A SECRET facility clearance will be required to manufacture these filters.  Please respond to this survey with your ability to vacuum deposit thin film optical interference filter coatings, of many layers and narrow rejection bands, with ultra high tolerance thickness control and that remain stable and will not degrade in typical military environments.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a Request for Proposal and the Government will not reimburse costs for providing any information.  Please submit your information to Kelly Nash at email address: kgerould@pica.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>--Solicitation of Commercial Firms to exhibit during 13th Annual Itam Workshop(Conference), 16-20 Aug 2004, in San Francisco, CA  DUE To be determined
<DESC>Sponsors of the 13th Annual Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Workshop are seeking commercial firms to exhibit their products and/or services for three days during the 2004 ITAM Workshop.  This year, the ITAM Workshop is to be held at the Hy att Regency San Francisco Hotel. 5 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA 94111. The annual ITAM Workshop is the leading national forum for the scientific exchange of technologies, ideas, experiences, and lessons learned that relate to the application of In tegrated Training Area Management(ITAM) technologies to the Army's military training lands.  The ITAM Programs at all US Army installations must play a critical role in assuring that military training can be sustained at the highest level for the foreseeab le future.  Training activities have increased, and training budgets are expanding.Businesses, organizations, companies, and individuals with products and servies that relate to land management;land repair and reclamation; wind and soil erosion management;  air and water quality issues; forestry and crop land management; GIS program development and support; road and trail creation and maintenance; environmental and climatological monitoring; unexploded ordnance; and other similar topics will find a ready aud ience among the ITAM Workshop participants. There will be approximately 500 decision-makers representing government and industry attending the 2004 ITAM Workshop.  It provides a unique opportunity to present and explain commercial products and services that can contribute to sustaining military trai ning and training land rehabilitation and maintenance to the ITAM Coordinators and their staffs.  This is the only all-Army event that brings together the ITAM teams from US Army installations worldwide. Compared to the costs of visiting individual militar y installations, the ITAM Workshop offers a most cost-effective sales strategy for companies and firms to hold significant face-to-face conversations with ITAM Coordinators and their staffs. The 2004 ITAM Workshop will focus on operations and environmental  programs for sustaining military training lands and maintaining Army readiness. In addition to the main program of technical presentations at the Workshop, there will be several specialized sessions, including a one-day Geographic Information System (GIS)  Workshop, a Range Training Lands Program (RTLP) session, a Land Condition Trends Analysis (LCTA) Workshop, and individual Major Army Command (MACOM) meetings. The 2004 ITAM Workshop is being hosted by Parks RFTA, the ITAM Installation Steering Committee, and the Army Training and Support Center. The commercial exhibits will be located in the newly-remodeled Pacific Concourse in the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Hotel.  The Morning Breaks, the AM Breaks, and PM Breaks all will be held in the Food Court adjace nt to the commercial exhibit area in the Pacific Concourse.  No program activities or breakout sessions will be scheduled for 30 minutes after each AM or PM Break begins on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Tuesday evening, a free, two-hour No-host Social for all pa rticipants will be held adjacent to the commercial exhibits in the Pacific Concourse. Commercial exhibitors are cordially invited to participate in all open sessions, tours, and social event associated with 2004 ITAM Workshop. For those who are interested,  commercial exhibitors will have an opportunity to present live demonstrations at Parks RFTA on Thursday, 19 Aug 2004. Due to current security concerns, these commercial exhibits will be approved on a first-come/first-served, case-by-case basis.  All comme rcial exhibit arrangements will be made through the National Institute for Land Management and Training (NILMT) at Kansas State University, the conference support contractor.  To obtain an application to exhibit during the 2004 ITAM Workshop or to secure f urther information, commercial exhibitors may contact Dr. Bert R. Biles, NILMT Associate Director, at 785.532.2104.   Dr Biles' e-mail address is brbiles@ksu.edu  Individuals interested in attending the 2004 ITAM Workshop may find additional information and/or register online at: http//www.army-itam.com or by calling the Kansas State University Division of Continuing Le arning Registration Desk at 785.532.5569.

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percentí for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to procure consulting services in support of the Research Business Models Subcommittee (RBM) on a sole source basis from Connie Atwell, Rockville, MD.  The purchase order term will be April 15, 2004 through April 14, 2005 with options for three (3) successive one-year periods.  The purpose of the Committee on Science is to advise and assist the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), with emphasis on those federally supported efforts that develop new knowledge in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.  Dr. Atwell has served as the co-chair of the Research Business Models Subcommittee of the Committee on Science for the past year.  She has unique knowledge of the issues to be addressed by the three Working Groups.  Together with Dr. Rodney Brown and Mr. Geoffrey Grant, Dr. Atwell led the establishment of priorities for the Subcommittee and has been involved with setting up the working plans for each of the priority issues.  Dr. Atwell will continue to coordinate the various issue groups and provide staff support to Dr. Norka Ruiz Bravo, who is now the co-chair of the Subcommittee.  She will also serve as the Steward for the group addressing the issue of co-Principal Investigators on research grants.  Dr. Atwell's background includes over 25 years of experience in research grant and contract administration.  For the past 11 years she was the Director of the Division of Extramural Research at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH, where she had responsibility for all of the scientific programs as well as the peer review, grants and contracts administration, and administrative services for a budget in excess of $1 billion.  She has chaired several committees concerned with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of research administration and has been on the Executive Committee of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), which is a public-private partnership also concerned with these same issues.  Most recently she served as the Senior Science Adviser to the FDP, appointed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy.  The Presidential Review Directive IV calls for periodic reviews of the relationship of the federal research agencies and the university research performance community.  The Research Business Models Subcommittee, which Dr. Atwell has co-chaired, is the vehicle for implementing this presidential mandate.  It is imperative that Dr. Atwell provide continuity for executing the mission of the Research Business Models Subcommittee.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner which will be considered by the NIH.

<DESC>Deployable Structures Experiment (DSX) Host Spacecraft Bus (HSB):  The DSX is a space flight experiment currently in execution by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate.  DSX is designed to conduct basic research experiments in 5 technical areas: 1) Large Deployable Structures, 2) System identification and adaptive control of the structural dynamics associated with large lightweight deployed structures, 3) Thin-film Photovoltaics, 4) Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave transmission and propagation in the magnetosphere, and 5) Space Weather.   AFRL is requesting proposals (technical and cost) in response to this Broad Area Announcement (BAA).  The objective of this BAA is the design, fabrication, environmental testing and delivery to AFRL/VS of a Host Spacecraft Bus with the capability to provide standard bus functions in support of the 5 DSX experiments.  Integration of the HSB with the DSX experiments, integrated environmental testing, launch vehicle integration, and mission operations shall be performed by AFRL or designated contractor at Kirtland AFB.  Innovation within the HSB development shall be directed towards lowering cost and increasing the responsiveness of both DSX and AFRL research and development (R&D) spacecraft in general.  Key technologies may include standardized electrical and mechanical interfaces suitable to a range of potential experiments, designs that increase launch opportunities, and novel concepts that result in significant cost reduction. See attachments for further details.

<DESC>The combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, W914NS-40-Q-0164 for UIC Railroad Turnout Styles 1:11 and 1:13 is amended to include the following paragraph:

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offerorís technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offerorís customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offerorís record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offerorís quote.  The technical quote will be more significant then the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.  Offerors shall also discuss how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
