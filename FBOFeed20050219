<DESC>The last paragraph in RFP Section L.8 is here by modified to read as follows:  

Proposals are due on January 21, 2005 by 2:00 p.m. local time.   Proposals issued before this date do not need to be resubmitted; however, Offerors may change or modify previously submitted proposals until the new proposal due date.  Proposals will not be accepted by any other means such as facsimile or e-mail.


The following are the questions received from prospective Offerors and their answers:

Question #1: Could you provide the name of the incumbent contractor and the dollar value of the current option period the contract is operating in? 

Answer #1:  This is a new requirement.  Previously, this requirement was handled via several different contract vehicles and contract types.   This contract vehicle and type are different from any previous contract vehicle and type, so there is no incumbent contract and dollar amount that directly relates to this procurement.

Question #2: Do you have a point of contact with the local Government for determining applicable wage rates?

Answer #2:  BBG is not aware of any wage requirements of the local government.

Provide peer review for Toxicological Profiles, health and chemical specific consultations and other documents prepared by or submitted for review by the agency.  This work includes identifying reviewers with appropriate expertise, ensuring and documenting the lack of conflict of interest in the review process, developing a plan for managing the review process within the time frame and within the context of the government needs, and providing reports in hardcopy or electronic format as appropriate in a manner most expeditious for utilizing the information in document development or review.  Competency includes:

·	Ability to access experts in appropriate fields.

Contact individuals to participate and develop a contract for services if necessary, develop travel plans, establish the facility for the meeting and coordinate post-meeting activities.  Plan announcements or publicity for the meeting and develop web-based meeting support as needed for information, registration, or other needs.

<DESC>Potential offerors are responsible for acknowledging all amendments to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

The purpose of this amendment is to provide the final questions and answers for the information of all potential offerors:

26. Amendment 2 - Appendix A - 5.4 and 5.5 reference PL-3 security and auditing requirements. Where can additional information and definition on PL-3 be attained? 
DCID 6/3

27. Amendment 2 - Appendix A - generally states requirements for VOIP equipment that any one solution provider's proposed VOIP system may not be able to meet at one hundred percent.  The Functional Description 2.1 in the base RFP states that each requirement listed in the Appendix A must be fully and not partially met. Will the evaluation factors take this into consideration when calculating technical merit and in what manner.  In short, are there a minimum of requirements in Appendix A that is absolute compared to the entire technical detail of Appendix A?  Evaluation factors listed in Addendum 52.212-1 will be used.

28. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 3.4, 3.5, 3.6: Is it the agency’s intention to maintain the equipment after the first year, or do you want a quote for option years based upon your 3 requirements in 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 of 24x7 Telephonic Support, Equipment Only, and On-Site Support. Provide annual cost for maintenance as defined in Appendix B – VoIP Cost Table. 

29. RFP Cost Table CLINs: In the Amendment/Solicitation 1 under Part III Cost/Price Selection, it specifies 2000 IP Phones and 2000 Licenses. The pricing section in solicitation 2 only calls for 2000 IP Phones. Is the pricing for 2000 Licenses still necessary? Are these 2000 Licenses in addition to the 6000 that are mandated in each RSC? Please explain. The pricing for IP phones and licensing pricing should be listed separately.  The 2000 licenses are part of the 6000 per RSC requirement.                                                                                                                                                          

30. RFP Amendment 1, Item 6.iv, Number of Copies/Page Limits: Will you allow 10 additional pages within the Technical proposal page count for an Executive Overview and to address some elements of the actual Statement of Objectives (maintenance, failover, etc.)? (i.e., 10 pages for the Overview/SOO and 25 pages for the technical matrix?).  Yes

31. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 4.10: Does the government require media encryption for conference calls or are they excluded from security requirements? The government’s technical requirements to include security are outlined in Appendix A. 

32. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 1.5: Does the government require media encryption beyond the boundaries of a “cluster” or is it acceptable to allow those calls to be unsecured? The government’s security requirements are listed in Appendix A-5.5  

33. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 1.5: Does the government require an encrypted solution that does not affect the voice quality in a meaningful way or is it acceptable to have substantially lower voice quality just to get encryption? The government’s technical requirements are outlined in Appendix A. 

34. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 1.5: Does the government require media encryption for ALL media gateways a vendor provides or is it acceptable to only provide it on certain gateways so the government has to keep track of what they buy to ensure their security model isn’t breached? The government’s technical requirements to include security are outlined in Appendix A. 

35. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government accept the use of proprietary protocols to simplify deployment if that same protocol is admonished to be turned off because it allows multiple security holes? The government’s technical requirements to include security and associated protocols are outlined in Appendix A. 

36. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government accept the use of proprietary protocols encapsulated in a standard as a standard? The government’s technical requirements are outlined in Appendix A. 

37. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a solution that is not in the process of being ported to another operating system with the inherent disruption that causes? The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

38. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a solution that supports applications such as E911, Contact Center, Call Queuing, etc. inherently or is the added cost, administrative burden and extra points of security of supporting these applications through additional servers acceptable? The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

39. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a solution that has demonstrated scalability and performance under load, or is it acceptable to have a solution that states maximum capacities and performance that cannot be achieved? The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

40. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a solution that is capable of re-routing voice traffic based on voice quality or is it acceptable to only re-route traffic on an actual loss of a circuit or call path? The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

41. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 1.3.2.1 Failover: Does the government require a solution with minimal call control failover (< 6 seconds) or is it acceptable to have a system that will take almost a minute and a half to failover? The government will utilize the evaluation factors outlined in Addendum 52.212 for the failover technical requirement. 

42. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a solution that is NOT reliant on the data network plumbing thereby reducing the potential cost of upgrades on the telephony system when the average lifespan of a router or Ethernet switch is just 18 months? The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

43. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 1.18.4: Does the government require a powering scheme that is based entirely on the industry standard for all phones in the vendor’s line or is it acceptable to use a combination of proprietary and standards-based power so the government has to keep track of what network switches support which phones? The government’s technical requirements are outlined in Appendix A. 

44. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a soft phone for mobility that is encrypted and works in remote locations that are in survivable mode or remote locations that do not have broadband access? The government’s technical requirements are outlined in Appendix A and do not include softphones. 

45. Appendix A, Technical Requirements 4.10: Does the government require a Meet-me conferencing solution with security codes for callers from any station or is it acceptable to only provide Meet-me conferences that are unsecured and only on IP Phones?  The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

46. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require a solution capable of adding on SIP capabilities that would allow them to re-use the existing Cisco phones currently deployed for investment protection? The government’s technical requirements are outlined in Appendix A and do not include SIP. 

47. Appendix A, Technical Requirements: Does the government require an IP Telephony solution with a demonstrated capability of operating over multi-vendor data networks or is it acceptable to have a solution that will only work over a homogeneous network that locks the government into that specific vendor and the ensuing pricing premiums associated with that model? The government requires a solution that is “generally available”prior to Jan 1, 2005 and is capable of meeting the specified technical requirements in Appendix A. 

48. What legacy PBXs, key systems does the proposed system need to interoperate with? It will interface with NSTS using T1 trunks. The government is not able to provide additional info about NSTS type, configuration, etc.

49. Item 1.2 - Please provide additional detail on the internal gateway requirement to place secure calls to other intelligence community users. Interface using 2-T1 trunks. 

50. Item 1.8 - Please specify type and quantity of WAN interfaces that need to be provided. The system will connect to the LAN at the RSC and the RSC LAN will interface with existing JWICS WAN.

51. Item 1.15.14 - Please provide specific definition of feature transparency across switches?  Is feature transparency only required between the sites being installed as part of this procurement? Ensuring features are maintained across 1) the proposed VoIP solution and 2) the proposed VoIP solution and NSTS.
