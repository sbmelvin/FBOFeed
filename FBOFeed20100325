<DESC>The Mind's Eye program seeks to develop in machines a capability that currently exists only in animals: visual intelligence. Humans in particular perform a wide range of visual tasks with ease, which no current artificial intelligence can do in a robust way. Humans have inherently strong spatial judgment and are able to learn new spatiotemporal concepts directly from the visual experience. Humans can visualize scenes and objects, as well as the actions involving those objects. Humans possess a powerful ability to manipulate those imagined scenes mentally to solve problems. A machine-based implementation of such abilities would be broadly applicable to a wide range of applications.<br /><br />Complete Announcement is Attached.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the Hydrospheric and Biospheric(HBS), ContractNNG09HP18C at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to procure a laser system andAttitude and position sensor system. The Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) is amedium/high-altitude wide-swath laser altimeter that has, for over a decade, demonstratedstate-of-the-art performance in measuring vegetation structure, and the topography ofland, oceans, ice sheets, and sea ice.	A new version of the LVIS sensor is beingdeveloped (LVIS-GH) specifically for operations in the Global Hawk aircraft.  The intentof this effort is to purchase upgrades to two key subsystems of LVIS-GH to make itsuitable for operations in a high-altitude, autonomous environment. The first is theLVIS-GH laser transmitter subsystem. This new laser system is required to have a fasterrepetition rate and higher pulse energy to compensate for the faster ground speed andhigher altitude experienced in the Global Hawk aircraft. The second system is thePrecision Attitude and Position Determination Subsystem consisting of a tightly-coupledGPS (Global Positioning System) and INS (Inertial Navigation Sensor). Currently, anApplanix POS/AV 510 unit is utilized with LVIS in lower altitude aircraft. To achieve therequired measurement accuracy from the high-altitude Global Hawk platform, a moreaccurate attitude determination system is required. Our analysis has determined that theApplanix POS/AV 610 has sufficient accuracy and performance to meet this requirement.This task under the HBS contract will be performed utilizing American Recovery andReinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.NASA/GSFC intends to award a new Task 055 under Contract No. NNG09HP18C with Sigma SpaceCorporation, 4801 Forbes Blvd, Lanham, MD  20706.  The Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) typecontract was competitively awarded to Sigma Space Corporation on June 15, 2009.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

INTRODUCTION 
Casa Grande Ruins National Monument (the Park) proposes expanding the Parks Visitor Center. The Visitor Center lies within the boundaries of the archeological site known as Compound A (Site Number AA:02:014 [ASM]). Compound A is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of Casa Grande Ruins National Monument (10-15-66). During Phase I testing for the proposed Visitor Center expansion, CAGR prepares a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the National Park Service and the Arizona State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) that addressed plans to mitigate the adverse effect of this proposed undertaking. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as invited to participate in the consultation leading to the completed MOA and recommended that CAGR solicit tribal participation in this process. The Gila River Indian Community was instrumental in the development and implementation of Phase I testing for this project. The Phase I testing identified, previously unknown, archeological features that require additional data recovery, beyond the scope of work included in the Phase I testing plan. This statement of work will address the need for full data recovery within Area 1, located immediately south of the existing Visitor Center building. 
TASK DESCRIPTION AND ACTIONS 
The Park has requested archeological assistance from the Gila River Indian Reservation (GRIC) in meeting its compliance obligations under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. In consultation with the Park and the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO),  a research design for Phase II data assessment in the proposed area of potential effect (APE) to 
mitigate adverse effect(s) of the proposed federal undertaking.
Research, data recovery, and artifact analysis will be conducted to determine the extent of intact deposits, 
stratigraphy and archeological features during this Phase II data recovery. The Phase II data recovery will be 
completed in fiscal year 2010. It will mitigate all archeological resources within the Area 1, as identified within 
the Phase I Archeological Data Recovery report. All data recovery will be conducted with prior concurrence of SHPO 
and notification of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). 
The proposed APE is located within the known site boundaries for Compound A which is listed on the NRHP, thus establishment of site significance is not an objective of the research. However, subsurface feature descriptions, 
research value, identification of any subsurface features that predate the Classic Period occupation of Compound A, archeological interpretations, and mitigation of subsurface archeological resources through data recovery methods are needed. Phase II data recovery will address these needs. GRIC will provide a research design for archeological assessment within the area of potential affect (APE) for this project following the guidelines outlined in 36CFR 800. 
The proposed APE for this project includes an area measuring approximately 376 square meters in area, located 
directly south of the 1963-1966 constructed, L-shaped addition. Hand excavation is preferred for this project, but limited backhoe trenching may be approved by the park if State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) concurrence is provided. Care will be taken not to disturb archeological resources outside of the proposed APE.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.eps.gov. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport will hold an Industry Day,  Wednesday April 21, 2010 to present and discuss Systems and Technologies for Port Security and the Detection, Classification and Tracking of Self Propelled Semi Submersibles (SPSS) and GoFast Boats used for illicit trafficking.  The DoD is interested in systems, technologies, analysis and integration that can lead to the detection, classification and tracking of SPSSs and GoFast boats used for illicit trafficking.  The DoD is also interested in systems and technologies that can be used for port and harbour security.   The overall objective of this effort is to develop detection, classification and tracking capabilities for vehicles used to transport illicit cargo on or under the water or that could have potential to provide harm to ports and harbors. Targets of interest operate in riverine, littoral and deep water environments.  There may be large amounts of other shipping and vessel traffic in the area (i.e. high clutter environment).  The search area may be very large area (>2000nmi2).   Systems and technologies can be stand alone or they maybe used in conjunction with or networked with other systems.  The systems and technologies must be able to be used in conjunction with existing Navy and DoD sensor systems, and command and control systems.  It is preferred that the sensor data be provided directly to existing command and control systems and not routed to another location prior to being sent to the existing command and control systems..  The detection, classification and tracking capability will be integrated into existing sensor systems and command and control systems. The evaluations will also allow us to identify technical avenues for future improvements to detection, classification and tracking sensor systems.  The goal is to develop a sensor system that will allow military forces to acoustically (or by other means) monitor long stretches of territory at a standoff range with minimal personnel and to automatically detect, classify and track and alert minimally-trained operators to vehicle movement.
To brief interested parties NUWC will host the Industry Day, April 21, 2010 at Building 80 to U.S. Citizens ONLY.  Registration will start at 8:30AM, presentations at 9:00AM and end at 11:00AM. The agenda will include Port Security, SPSS and GoFast Boat illicit trafficking overview, requirements, and end with technology discussions.  Questions regarding this Industry Day shall be directed to Gregory Cyr, (Gregory.Cyr@navy.mil), 401-832-8505.  The Government shall not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request.  
Attendees must register and submit their information by April 14, 2010.  For further information on security, directions and lodging please visit http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/ under visitor information.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541512   REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY:DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTEDPURPOSE
The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry input for the development of a solution to submit filings associated with the New Substance Notification Project for member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). The EPA, as a member of the OECD Clearing House on New Chemicals, has a vested interest in facilitating the development of a solution for industry submitters of New Chemical notices. With the advent of EPA's electronic PMN solution and it's scheduled deployment in the Spring of 2010 (see Annex 1), EPA has a particular interest in ensuring that efficiencies be established for related regulatory submissions and this includes the OECD's effort to streamline New Chemical notification submission processes. It is the intent of this RFI to receive creative ideas for a potential solution and gain an understanding of the level of effort necessary to provide a solution for industry in order to assist the OECD.  The OECD is in the early stages of developing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a solution for the New Substance Notification Project. Responses to this RFI will be used to inform the OECD in the development of an RFP.
BACKGROUND
Certain countries require that companies submit New Chemical notifications prior to manufacturing and importing new chemicals within those countries.  There are a broad array of required forms but many similarities exists in the forms, and in the data and information submitted, as well as specific procedures and processes governments used to review these submissions.  Recognizing that similarities in New Chemical submissions exist internationally, a Workgroup was convened under the auspices of the OECD Clearing House on New Chemicals to look for opportunities to collaborate.  "The OECD [New Chemicals Program] brings together government officials and stakeholders who review and assess notifications from companies who wish to market new chemicals and explores ways to share such work and harmonize activities to reduce work for governments and costs for industry".Various Workgroups were convened to navigate through issues ("Items") and in some cases perform pilot projects.  The specific goal of the "Workgroup Item C" was to determine the feasibility of and, if feasible, to develop a solution a company could use to more efficiently submit notifications to multiple government using a single company "repository" of potential New Chemicals' data.
Attempts have been made by the OECD to construct such a tool.  Previous work includes the construction of a mapping spreadsheet (Annex 4 Form fields.xls) using fields from the various notification forms of member countries (Annex 3). In addition, an attempt was made to build a solution using MySQL and PHP.  A developer was tasked to provide a document describing the effort that could be involved in expanding the most recent attempt to a system that would allow the import and export of xml-tagged information elements from a notifier's system into the required notification forms or into a notifier's or government's IT system.  A document identified as "Proposal for Completion of the New Substances Notification Project" (Annex 2) accompanies this RFI.  Also, the other documentation includes a list of the member countries for which the New Chemicals filings should be considered (in Annex 2), as well as their respective data elements (in Annex 4).
SCOPE
The solution will allow chemical companies to collect data required for New Chemical notifications across several countries into one system. When the data are collected, the solution will generate the forms/data of the New Chemical notification in the required format of each country, which will be submitted to the countries where the company intends to market their product.  It is desirable that this solution would be built to scale to electronic submissions using XML.  
In addition, the response should provide thoughts on how best to properly maintain such a solution including operations and maintenance, change management, documentation and configuration management.  Cost effective and creative strategies such as appropriate use of share ware and collaborative tools should be considered.  To minimize effort and costs and for efficiency use of existing data standards and templates is also encouraged, e.g. OECD's harmonized templates, but not required. 
WHAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI
Responses to this RFI should provide the following information for existing or near-term solutions that may address all or part of the requirements for providing the necessary solution or solutions:1.	Descriptive information to include product literature on existing or proposed software or services capabilities as well as succinct narrative statements that describe the innovative solutions and the new or existing technological capabilities.2.	Solution overview to include a general description including functionality and matters related to the overall design.3.	If a similar solution has been implemented, clients and a point of contact for whom the solution was or is being developed, and a high-level description of the client's problem space as compared to OECD's as documented in the attachments.4.	If options are provided compare and contrast both benefits and level of effort needed to develop and maintain the solutions.  The level of effort can be a subjective estimation of the work needed to maintain the system.  5.	In addition any information that helps to clarify what COTS or GOTS solutions are proposed leveraged in the solution and what level of customization maybe required?6.	Responses should also indicate willingness to offer "no cost" demonstrations projects or software. 
All responses should be provided in writing, either as Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word documents.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation willnot be issued.    This requirement is being issued per FAR 11.104, for brand name or equal components.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-38.  The associated NAICS code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $18.5 million.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is engaged in monitoring in coastal and offshore areas of the United States of America which often requires non-destructive sampling and characterization of sediment surfaces and benthic habitats using specialized photographic equipment referred to as a sediment profile imaging camera.  EPA currently utilizes an Ocean Imaging Systems 3731 sediment profile camera rated to 1000 meters.  EPA seeks an underwater digital still camera package supplied complete with mounting hardware that is specific to our existing sediment profile camera, so that this still camera can be easily retrofitted to the Ocean Imaging Systems 3731 frame to allow plan view images of the sediment surface to be captured.  The optics and geometry of the still camera must be configured so that neither camera will interfere with the operation of the other. This still camera package shall include a housed optics/camera/electronics assembly, two housed strobe assemblies, two scaling lasers and associated hardware, a bottom trigger switch, batteries and chargers, download cables, a technical instruction manual, and all other necessary equipment.  EPA Region 2 has reviewed commercially available packages via the Internet and with the assistance and consultation of experts within EPA Office of Research and Development and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This review identified the Ocean Imaging Systems cameras, strobes, housings, lasers, and hardware as particularly, perhaps uniquely well-suited for the proposed work.  Specifically, the Region has selected the Ocean Imaging Systems Model DSC 12000 Digital Still Camera/Housing with 2 Model 3831 Internally Powered Strobe/Housings with Model B-373-76 Bottom Trigger Switch, scaling lasers and Mounting Hardware.  The selection of the Ocean Imaging Systems products will ensure that the cameras, strobes, lasers, and mounting hardware are 100% compatible with the existing frame and thus minimize the field validation and verification needed for quality assurance.  Therefore the specifications provided above are those associated with a specific package available from Ocean Imaging Systems; other providers will need to demonstrate that they can meet the following salient characteristics: This package must meet the following specifications: 1 - Camera and strobes to be self-contained, requiring only a physical cable connection to the sampling vessel.  All deployed components to be rugged, constructed of materials resistant to corrosion in sea water, and rated at 1000 meter working depth minimum. 2 - Strobes to be capable of delivering at least 500 flashes between charges to facilitate survey applications. 3 - Digital imager to have a minimum 10 megapixel resolution, and to be readily available as a replacement. Unit shall have battery and memory capacity to capture at least 250 images before data download or battery recharge. 4- lasers allow for scaling of bottom features, and 5 - Most importantly, the attachment of the plan-view camera system to our existing Ocean Imaging Systems 3731 sediment profile camera, configured and tested so the plan-view camera will mount securely to the sediment profile camera frame, and both cameras will operate without interference.  The vendor must provide evidence that clearly demonstrates that the proposed equipment meets the salient characteristics identified above and include a list of Government agencies or contractors, including name and phone number for point of contact, that have utilized similarly configured equipment with a Model 3731 Camera and Frame.  Delivery of the instrument shall be FOB Destination (shipping cost included in the item price) within 60 days of receipt of order.  Delivery, inspection and acceptance will be at: US Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Environmental Planning and Protection, Dredging, Sediments, and Oceans Team, 290 Broadway, New York NY 10007.  The Government intends to issue a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsive, responsible vendor whose quote represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors, in order of importance, will be used for evaluation purposes: 1. Meets all salient characteristics described above.  Pictures, documentation and references must be provided to establish that the package meets the characteristics 2.  Repair and calibration facilities within the contiguous U.S. (lower 48 states)  3. Past performance of similarly configured camera  4.  Interchangeability and compatibility of probes with other EPA-owned equipment on the OSV Bold  (i.e. Ocean Imaging Systems 3731). 6. Price. Vendors doing business with the Federal Government are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registration information can be found at  https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.  All vendors are to include with their quote a copy of FAR Provision 52.212-3.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The SPSS Clementine shall consist of the following modules: Modeler Server Client Enablement Server Based, PASW Association Server Based, PASW Association Server Core Based, PASW Classification Server Based, PASW Classification Server Core Based, PASW Modeler Server Based, PASW Modeler Server Core Based, PASW Segmentation Server Based and PASW Segmentation Server Core Based.
 
This acquisition is being conducted on a sole-source basis because SPSS Incorporated is the owner and has full right and title to license the software package SPSS Clementine.  SPSS Incorporated is the sole entity permitted to license SPSS Clementine.
This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source.  Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 5 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb, Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or vial email at awebb@psc.gov.

Furthermore, NACE will continue to leverage public and private resources through partnerships to achieve long-term goals. The Center will have an Expert Panel that will continue to develop and sustain these partnerships.

<a href="mailto:nelson.cruhigger@us.army.mil">USACE District, Fort Worth</a>
<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:<BR>a. General: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Construction Phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <BR><BR>The proposed A-E contract will support the construction of an approximately $1.5B Hospital located at Fort Bliss, Texas and could include CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.<BR><BR>This announcement is open only to SMALL BUSINESSES.  The prime A-E firm must perform 50% or more of the work on this contract.  Anticipated contract award will be on or about May, 2010.  One (1) Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) with a minimum guarantee amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) only for the base period of 2 years with one 3 year option and for a term not to exceed five years combined.  <BR><BR>Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).  Provide documentation that the firm is an architect or engineering firm in Section H of the SF330.<BR><BR>Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. <BR><BR>There will be NO design services included in this contract.<BR><BR>Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement.  When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award.  Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required.  And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order.  A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract.  However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer.  Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<BR><BR>b. Nature of Work:  The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order.  Personnel provided by this contract will operate out of Government supplied facilities.<BR><BR>c. Contract Award Procedure:  The proposed services will be obtained by Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov .<BR><BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION:  Construction Phase Services are required to support construction activities and may include tasks supporting projects not yet in construction.

<DESC>The Personnel Recovery Center of Excellence project consists of three combined projects and includes the construction of a new HC-130J Squadron Operations Facility and HC-130J Simulator Facility and Infrastructure for the two projects at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona.  The HC-130J Squadron Operations Facility project will consist of the following:   This project provides for the construction of a 2,323 SM (25,000SF) HC-130-J Rescue Squadron (RQS) Operations Facility. The new building will house personnel supporting the Rescue Squadron (RQS) HC-130J flight operations mission and contains administration, planning, and briefing facilities. New site construction at the RQS Operations site consists of rigid pavement (concrete aprons), flexible pavement (access roads and parking area), an electrical yard, a dumpster enclosure, concrete stoops and pads, CMU walls, sidewalks, curb and gutter, drainage ditches and swales, and associated service utilities.  Concurrent construction (separate contracts), consisting of a Flight Simulator Facility and a Central Chiller Plant, will occupy the same site as the RQS Operations Facility.  The HC-130J Simulator Facility project will consist of the following:   This project provides for the construction of a 1,256 SM (13,517 SF) HC-130-J Flight Simulator Facility. The new building will house one simulator (for an HC-130J aircraft) and associated support facilities. Support facilities consist of administration, training, mission planning, and maintenance functions. New site construction at the Simulator site consists of rigid pavement (concrete aprons), flexible pavement (access roads and parking area expansion), an electrical yard, a dumpster enclosure, an aggregate surface turnaround, concrete stoops and pads, CMU walls, sidewalks, curb and gutter, drainage ditches and swales, a detention pond, and associated service utilities. Concurrent construction (separate contracts), consisting of a RQS Operations Facility and a Central Chiller Plant, will occupy the same site as the Simulator Facility.  The HC-130J Infrastructure project will consist of the following:  The PRCOE Infrastructure project is comprised of two main components, a utility infrastructure component and a road infrastructure component. The utility component of the project consists of the installation of new utility mains as well as the construction of a new 168 SM (1,817SF) central plant with 800 ton cooling capacity and a new fire suppression pump house.  The central plant and the pump house are located approximately one half mile apart.  Included with the pump house are two new 72k gallon water ground storage tanks to provide an adequate volume of water for the new fire suppression system. The existing water distribution system is not capable of supplying the large fire suppression flow rates needed to supply the fire pumps.  The second component of this project is to construct new paved roadways within the project area designated for the planned PRCOE program. The PRCOE program area is currently in the planning stage of development.

<DESC>This project is for replacement of the Snake River Excitation System.  The excitation system provides field current for a synchronous machine, including all power, regulating, control, and protective elements.  Each unit generator has a stand alone exciter. Twelve unit exciters are scheduled to be replaced:  Units 1 thru 6 at Little Goose Lock and Dam, Units 4 thru 6 at Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Units 4 thru 6 at Lower Granite Lock and Dam.<BR><BR>The contract will require the supply and installation of a digital excitation system for each of the twelve units.  The excitation system includes the following; new digital exciters, molded case circuit breakers, exciter cubicles, fuse cabinets, regulator cabinets, power potential transformers, digital controls, collector ring assemblies (collector ring, brush holders, brushes and supports), and associated cabling and wires.  Modifications to the existing switchboard will also be required. Additionally, the contract will require the removal, demolition and disposal of the non-rotating parts for these units, and removal of the existing excitation power, signal and control cabling, and slip rings for each existing excitation system.  Concrete Patching, grouting and repair will also be required.<BR><BR>The period of performance for the contract is approximately three years.  The period of performance for onsite work is dependent upon the spring runoff and fish passage windows that generally provide seven to nine calendar months of on-site work access, July through March.  Submittals, manufacture, delivery and site preparation outside of the allowable outage windows may start anytime after award.  Project site priority and coordination with other project work windows may also dictate other construction schedule requirements and restrictions.<BR><BR>Solicitation No. W912EF-10-R-0002 will be posted to the FBO website on or about April 12, 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS. Please reference Request for Quotation (RFQ) Number VA-791-10-RQ-0003. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Denver Acquisition and Logistic Center (DALC), 155 Van Gordon Street, Lakewood, CO 80228, intends to solicit for quotations from qualified and experienced community dialysis providers through full and open competition.  The intent of this RFQ is to execute multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) throughout multiple geographic areas, as listed at the end of this announcement. Community providers must be Medicare certified, capable providing, delivering, supervising, and monitoring dialysis services.  Community providers or their representative may offer to provide the following services: outpatient hemodialysis, outpatient peritoneal dialysis, home dialysis to include peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis, and home dialysis training beneficiaries. Outpatient dialysis and home dialysis training will be delivered at the community providers facilities.  Home and outpatient based dialysis services will utilize the community provider's resources, staff, and equipment necessary or required for peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis.  The offeror will provide the services and associated health care in a manner consistent with the clinical needs of the patient and extend the same or superior standards of quality care as delivered to non VA patients.The community provider's personnel rendering services will be certified, licensed, board certified, or board eligible as appropriate for the region of care. Services will be provided in a medically acceptable setting and employ medically safe practices. The RFQ and subsequent agreements will not include professional nephrology services.  All billings will be in Medicare compliant format.  All treatment modalities must be in accordance with the Medicare treatment guidelines. Offerors will be responsible for internal and subcontractor's Quality Assurance and ongoing Continuous Quality Improvement measures. Offerors must safe-guard the VA patient's information in accordance to the VA, Privacy Act, and HIPAA requirements.  The government intends to execute multiple BOAs with four 1 year renewal periods. BOA's are negotiated instruments of understanding that put in place terms and conditions for future orders. Orders will be placed by the VA Medical Center via an authorization to a offeror based on the proximity to the Veterans place of residence, the Veterans preference, the lowest per treatment price, and/or per clinical direction of the VA patient's physician or treatment provider (this include VA social workers). The VA intends to give priority to BOA holding providers where available when determining via which mechanism to place an authorization for care (i.e. BOA holding providers or Fee Basis Care), when it makes business sense to do so.  Offerors will be held to the terms and conditions of the BOA upon acceptance of an authorization, (which becomes a binding task order). By signing the RFQ offerors are attesting that they are Medicare certified, that all facilities are maintained in accordance with Medicare standards, and meet the terms and conditions set forth in the RFQ. An abbreviated technical proposal may be required to validate offeror qualifications. Offerors will offer a firm all inclusive per treatment price for dialysis services. Subject procurement adheres to the format defined in FAR 12 and will be conducted using the procedures of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 15 to the extent required for Basic Ordering Agreements.  These services are being procured under the authority of Title 38 U.S.C. Section 8153, Sharing of Heath Care Resources. The North American Classification Code is 621492, Dialysis Centers and Clinics. The Small Business Size Standard is $34,500,000.00. This acquisition will be conducted as a "full and open" competition for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entity(s) who can meet the requirements and whose pricing is considered reasonable. Agreements will be executed with the offeror(s) whose price is within reasonable range of Medicare's reimbursement for the services offered and meet the technical requirements in the locations where services are needed. Solicitation documents will be available electronically on or about April 8, 2010 through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. NO HARD COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. The anticipated closing date is April 28, 2010. Agreements will be executed utilizing a staggered award approach. The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Gabrielle Harris. Offerors interested in responding to this solicitation should provide their email addresses and contact information to nonvadialysis@va.gov. Respondents will receive updates and have the ability to participate in a web based pre-proposal conference.

<DESC>This "Sources Sought" Notice is being issued for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) South Atlantic Area (SAA).
<p>The SAA is conducting a market survey to identify the availability, interest, and capabilities of qualified members of the Small Business community [Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Historically Underutilized Business Zone businesses, and certified 8(a) firms] as potential sources of services for the project described below.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238140, Masonry Contractors.&nbsp; (This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in masonry work, stone setting, brick laying, and other stone work.&nbsp; The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs.)&nbsp; The small business size standard is $14,000,000 average annual receipts for the last three years.</p>
<p>The project is entitled RRC Cleaning, Caulking, and Sealing, Athens, Georgia.</p>
<p>The project primarily includes repairing of limestone and caulking, and cleaning and resealing of the exterior limestone panels on the Russell Research Center in Athens.&nbsp; The building was erected in the late 1960's and limestone panels have therefore been in place for almost 50 years.&nbsp; Some repairs and joint sealant replacement work has occurred over the years, but a comprehensive effort is desirable at this time.</p>
<p>Where possible, deteriorated panels are to be repaired. Both horizontal and vertical cracks are observable.&nbsp; In addition, the work is to include cleaning of all exterior windows.</p>
<p>EXISTING CONDITIONS:</p>
<p>The building is currently occupied and all work must be completed under this condition.&nbsp; As noted, the panels are nearly 50 years old and exhibit discoloration, joint failures, and horizontal and vertical cracking.</p>
<p>Discoloration is presumed to result from a lack of sealing and exposure to the elements over time. Joint sealant failures are attributable to the age of the sealants and exposure, resulting in a loss of elasticity.</p>
<p>Cracking also results from these conditions, as well as the methods in which panels were shimmed and secured. Joints are also considered to be slightly undersized at &frac14;" as normally they are closer to 3/8".&nbsp; The spacing cannot be revised at this time.</p>
<p>Rust stains are not due to corrosion on steel supports as originally presumed, but rather a result of other conditions.&nbsp; The two most likely causes are moisture migration through the cement-rich parge coat on the back of the installed panels or iron ore inclusions in the stone itself.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF NEW WORK:</p>
<p>The new work is primarily repair, cleaning and sealing of the panels, along with washing of the windows.&nbsp; Panels will be repaired as budget will allow.&nbsp; The project will be awarded to one prime contractor.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this project is estimated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000.</p>
<p>Interested firms or teams are invited to respond to this announcement by providing the following information: a) geographical location(s) of major and satellite offices; b) business size (large or small) and type of firm, such as 8(a) concern, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business; c) company literature/documentation supporting experience in projects of this size and scope; and d) experience in successfully completed projects of the nature of this project.&nbsp; It is very important to identify your business type as identified above.&nbsp; A document is attached to this notice to help you in gathering and providing some of the requested information; you are strongly encouraged to complete and submit this document (or use as a guide for submitting the requested information). &nbsp;NO SOLICITATION EXISTS, AND A FORMAL PROPOSAL IS NOT REQUESTED. THIS NOTICE IS INTENDED ONLY TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF THE REQUIRED SERVICES TO ASSIST IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE TYPE SET-ASIDE THAT MIGHT BE USED.&nbsp; The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought announcement. &nbsp;The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.</p>
<p>SPECIAL NOTICE:&nbsp; The Russell Research Center is a controlled-access facility . It is a minimum of eight stories high (in the front, with sub-basement and basement heights included at the rear).&nbsp; Your experience should identify not only the contracts for this type of limestone construction, but also buildings of this size.&nbsp; An attachment to this sources-sought announcement may help you determine the size of the building and some of the effort that might be required in the completion of the project.</p>
<p>No site visits to the facility are allowed at this time. &nbsp;No calls or inquiries will be accepted in regards to the detailed requirements of the project.</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to respond to this notice by April 5, 2010.&nbsp; The information about your firm shall be limited to no more than 10 pages.&nbsp; Interested firms are requested to submit written responses by e-mail to alan.moore@ars.usda.gov, by fax to (706) 546-3444 or by mail to Alan Moore, USDA ARS SAA APPO, 950 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605.&nbsp; Please cite the project name in your response.&nbsp; Your submittal will not be acknowledged, nor will you be specifically informed when (if) a solicitation is issued. Please monitor this FedBizOpps website for any presolicitation notice and solicitation that might be issued.</p>

<DESC>TITLE: Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) Sources Sought
THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT.   The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting market research in support of a forthcoming source selection for the follow-on T-6 COMBS services contract.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, the Government anticipates award of a five-year, predominately Firm-Fixed-Price contract (one year basic period, with four priced one-year options) with a small portion of Cost or Time and Materials effort.  The anticipated award date is no later than September 2011. 
As part of the market research, ASC will be holding Industry Days on 14-15 April 2010 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Foulois Hall in Bldg 145, Area B (reference map attached). This event is to communicate with industry regarding a potential T-6 COMBS source selection, specifically the draft requirements, and identify potential offerors.
All contractors wishing to participate in the Industry Day must provide a list of the attending individual(s) name, company, and contact information to the Government points of contact no later than close of business 7 April 2010, so the Government may arrange for base access.  The notification of attendance should specify whether the attendees will only attend the overall group session on 14 April 2010, or would also like a one-on-one session with the Government.  Should the 14 April 2010 group contractor discussion end early, the potential exists for one-on-one sessions that afternoon or on 15 April 2010.  Should multiple contractors want the same time slot(s), time slots will be assigned on a first-requested, first-scheduled basis.  All contractors wanting a meeting will be accommodated, thus specify in the notification of attendance preferred times to conduct one-on-one sessions (first, second, and third choices) in accordance with the schedule below.
Time slots for one-on-one sessions are approximately 14 April 2010, 1:30-2:30 PM and 3:00-4:00 PM;  and  15 April 2010, 08:30-09:30 AM; 10:00-11:00 AM; 1:00-2:00 PM; and 2:30-3:30 PM.   All times are Eastern Time.   
NOTE:  ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS ARE FOR CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS OR FEEDBACK ONLY.  ALL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES RAISED DURING THESE SESSIONS WILL BE DISCLOSED VIA PXIS FOLLOWING CONCLUSION OF INDUSTRY DAY(S).
T-6 BACKGROUND:  The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which uses Non-Developmental Items or derivatives of commercially available items to meet most system requirements. The T-6B is a further refinement which provides for upgraded avionics (including heads-up display). The original T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company, Wichita, Kansas (now Hawker Beechcraft Corporation - HBC) to replace the United States Air Force (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary training aircraft. HBC owns the data/data rights to the T-6A design and peculiar Support Equipment (SE).  HBC or their subcontractors own some data/data rights for T-6B parts.   The T-6 is a low wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer. The T-6 provides entry-level students with the skills necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and navigation during both day and night conditions. T-6 training will lead to a level of proficien! cy that permits transition into one of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks. 
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT: As of this PIXS announcement, there are over 500 T-6A and T-6B aircraft in the combined USAF/USN fleet.  The T-6A and T-6B aircraft are stationed at the following main operating bases (MOB): Randolph AFB, Laughlin AFB, Sheppard AFB, Vance AFB, Columbus AFB; NAS Pensacola (USAF), NAS Pensacola (USN), NAS Whiting Field, and NAS PAX River.  Additionally, the USN intends to begin bed-down of T-6B aircraft at NAS Corpus Christi in 2012. The T-6 production line is scheduled to continue through FY15 with the production of approximately 40 aircraft per year, building to a total fleet size of 768. 
HBC is the prime contractor for both T-6 production and COMBS efforts. There are approximately 6,000 aircraft part numbers and approximately 300 SE numbers that need to be managed; this figure may change as configuration changes are accomplished on the aircraft. Historically, the Government has processed approximately twelve configuration changes each year that involve (but are not limited to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear) and avionics subsystems. COMBS must accomodate these changes as they occur such that no gap exists between configuration change and COMBS services. Current estimates of the number of transactions conducted annually range from 500,000 to over 700,000.  The entirety of the COMBS inventory is Government Furnished Property (spares, consumables, and SE).  If the awardee of this contract is other than the incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft manufactu! rer/sustaining engineering contractor (currently HBC). The Government may also require ACA(s) with major subsystem contractors for avionics, engines, etc.  All aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified processes to maintain airworthiness certification. 
FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT DESCRIPTION:  The follow-on contract will procure COMBS services in accordance with FAR Part 15 for T-6A and T-6B aircraft at the associated USAF and USN sites.  The follow-on contract will be subject to the Service Contract Act.  The Government will provide the initial inventory of COMBS spare parts and SE.  The contractor shall establish, operate and manage a COMBS facility at each MOB (as detailed in the Performance Work Statement (PWS)), to provide a range and depth of spare parts/bench stock including parts for off-equipment/I-Level back shops, spare engines, engine Quick Engine Change kits, engine modular components, repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, SE, and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary to support the assigned aircraft at the base-specified utilization rates (provided in the PWS). The selected contractor shall ensure all COMBS components are FAA-certified in accordance with FAA Regulation Part 23. The contr! actor shall ensure all spare parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for immediate installation on aircraft in accordance with the approved government technical data. The contractor shall ensure all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within each item's allowable limitations and tolerances.  No aircraft component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished by the COMBS contractor within a COMBS facility. The contractor shall only store T-6-specific parts, TCTO/TD kits and SE in COMBS (parts shall not co-mingle with other platforms' assets). The contractor shall maintain data outlining required protective packaging and transportation requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items, hazardous materials, etc) for spare parts and SE subject to special packaging requirements. 
The contractor shall support the bases' and air stations' daily flight operations and any Operating Plan (OPLAN), exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by, incentive flight or open house that involves T-6 aircraft or COMBS. The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables available for the operating command as specified by the base-specific performance metrics in the PWS.  The COMBS contractor shall maintain the COMBS spare inventory and SE.  As T-6 configuration changes are accomplished, the COMBS contractor shall update COMBS services as appropriate.  The COMBS contractor shall perform or subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed reparable components.  The COMBS contractor shall provide their own office equipment, phones, furniture, material handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS beyond what is detailed as Government-furnished in the PWS. The COMBS contractor shall manage hazardous material IAW current Federal, State and B! ase regulations. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This announcement is a  sources sought/market research tool to determine the availability and capability of potential sources and ensure early industry involvement in validating the explanation of the requirement.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541614, Process, Physical Distribution and Logistics Consulting Services, applies to this acquisition. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database to be awarded a DoD contract. Interested sources are encouraged to first register on the PIXS Web Site (http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil). PLEASE INFORM THE GOVERNMENT IF YOUR FIRM INTENDS TO PERFORM THE WORK SOLELY OR IF YOU DESIRE T! O SUBCONTRACT WITH A PRIME CONTRACTOR.
No set aside decision has been made; however, the Government is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.  A key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is the small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  The clause reads, in part, as follows:  "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) . (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies).  The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percen! t of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials." 
Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.
Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion if a solicitation is issued.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements must be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.
SOURCES SOUGHT/ MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONS:  Technical considerations in addition to the information requested above: interested firms should submit sufficient information that will permit evaluation of their technical capabilities.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Natick, MA is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources capable of rapidly delivering portable solid waste incinerators or other solid waste thermal decomposition systems.  PM FSS is not seeking information on concepts or prototypes still under development, rather, systems that are immediately ready to be deployed to oveerseas Forward Operating Bases (FOBs).  This market survey is for the Government to assess existing market capability, and responses are voluntary.  This notice is not an Invitation for Bid or Request for Propsal.  The Army is interested in these systems to reduce the volume of mixed solid wastes at its non-permanent, deployable base camps under field conditions, and to eliminate the safety and health hazards associated with burning solid waste in burn boxes or open pits.  A secondary interest of PM FSS is in immediately available heat recovery (for hot water) or waste to energy capabilities to supplement the incinerator.  Required waste feedstock will be mixtures of organic and inorganic materials such as paper, plastic, glass, food, and metal.  The solid waste will not include medical or hazardous wastes.  In order to accommodate variously-sized and widely dispersed base camps, PM FSS is interested in learning of any immediately available, portable solid waste thermal decomposition systems that have a maximum throughput capacity of either 500 pounds per day, 1500 pounds per day, or 6000 pounds per day.  The system must be able to function with diesel or JP8 fuel, because gaseous and solid fuels are not available in the area of operation.<BR><BR>INFORMATION OF INTEREST:<BR><BR>To support this market survey, PM FSS requests that interested parties provide product literature, system characteristics, test data, and illustrations that provide the following information about their systems:<BR><BR>1.   Throughput capacity (pounds per day).  Capacities should fit into one of the following 3 categories:  200 to 500 lbs/day; 501 to 1500 lbs/day; or 1501 to 6000 pounds per day.<BR>2.   Solid waste weight and volumne reduction<BR>3.   Estimated lead time for delivery<BR>4.   Footprint size, cube and weight of the system in both transport and operation modes<BR>5.   Total unobstructed ground space required for the safe set up and operation of the solid waste system within a FOB, to include safe distances from fabric tents and other structures<BR>6.   Pollution controls and regulatory compliance status<BR>7.   Fuel consumption (gallons per day)<BR>8.   Other consumables (e.g., gallons per day of water, chemicals, filters)<BR>9.   Electrical power demand<BR>10.  Process by-products and effluents (e.g. ash, water, etc) that require separate disposal<BR>11.  Current locations and applications where incinerator is used<BR>12.  Material handling equipment requirements<BR>13.  Prohibited waste types or sizes<BR>14.  Moisture limits of waste<BR>15.  Waste pre-processing requirements<BR>16.  Waste feed process (batch or continuous)<BR>17.  Estimated man-hours and skills required for set up and break down<BR>18.  Estimated man-hours and skills required to support daily operations and maintenance<BR>19.  Shipping configuration (e.g., pallets, skids, ISO containers)<BR>20.  Unit price, assuming an order of 50 systems of a particular size<BR>21.  Estimated per unit delivery price to CONUS locations on the East Coast<BR>22.

SUBJECT:	SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

PROJECT:	Pantex Renewable Energy Project at Pantex Plant, Amarillo, Texas

Babcock &Wilcox Technical Services Pantex, LLC, is seeking interested parties for the competitive procurement of a renewable energy facility, to be located on US Department of Energy property at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas.

Background
The B&W Pantex Plant is located on FM 2373 approximately 17 miles northeast of Amarillo.  It is a Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) nuclear weapons plant managed and operated by B&W Pantex.  

General Scope Description
Electricity is a required utility as the Pantex Plant relies on electrical power to perform the functions of the Plant. The objective of the Pantex Renewable Energy Project (PREP) is to have a private entity design and build the wind farm on Government property, and subsequently execute a lease-to-own agreement with B&W Pantex.

The PREP will provide a potential research opportunity for the National Wind Research Center (NWRC) to perform research and educational opportunities to further the use of renewable energy.  The research entity or the NWRC shall have exclusive use of the wind farm to further energy technology, performance, reliability and effectiveness as part of the research effort.

This project shall provide turnkey Contractor services for B&W Pantex.  These services shall be for the design, equipment & material procurements, construction, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing "mark-ups") for the Pantex Renewable Energy Project. More specifically, the project is comprised of:

A.	 Wind Farm Requirements

1.	Design-Build-Operate a 15 MW name plate (NP) generating capacity Wind Farm on Government property to include;
a.	Design/Purchase/Installation of wind turbines generators (WTGs).  WTG size shall be between 1.5 - 3.0 MW generating capacity.  WTGs shall be new and use current technology.
b.	Design/Construction/Installation of electrical distribution lines and transformers for connection of the WTGs.
c.	Design/Construction/Installation of electrical distribution lines connecting wind farm to Pantex distribution substation(s).
2.	Wind Farm to be developed under a lease-to-own agreement with the Government.   Government shall own the wind farm upon completion of installation and system becoming operational.
3.	Government will make annual lease-to-own payments to the developer for no more than 25 years or until the mortgage is paid off to the developer after the wind farm is successfully operational.  The Government shall also have the option to pay down the lease-own contract in lump sum amounts at any time.
4.	Wind Farm Developer and Subcontractors shall comply with Pantex Security and site access requirements and the Wind Farm will be located in Pantex’s lowest Security Area.
5.	Wind Farm to supply power for Pantex Plant use.  DOE/NNSA has an approved Qualifying Facility (QF) application.  All electrical power generated per the QF (15MW NP) shall be property of the Government under the lease to own agreement.
6.	Wind Farm to be Constructed/Installed on Government owned property.
7.	Wind Farm WTGs to be available for research capabilities;
a.	Turbine operations to be interrupted as needed for equipment change out and instrumentation purposes.
b.	Turbine operations to be interrupted as needed for testing, instrumentation, maintenance, or training purposes.  
8.	Final location of WTGs (including height), size and design of wind farm to be approved by Pantex and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The FAA application has already been submitted for approval by the NNSA Pantex Site Office.
9.	Wind Farm construction shall include installation of roads, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, signage, fences, and other needed infrastructure for access and maintenance.
10.	Pantex is located in a Class 4 Wind Power area.  Meteorological data is available for the proposed site.
11.	The Developer shall be responsible for warranty and maintenance for the determined warranty period and maintenance for the useful life of the WTG’s.
12.	A potential research element might exist with the 15MW of WTG’s and any potential expansion.  
13.	Any future expansion of the Wind Farm under the project shall be on Government owned or Government controlled property up to 40 MW Average Generating Capacity (AGC). 
14.	Any future expansion on Government owned property will require the developer to pay land use royalties to the Government.
15.	Power generated from future expansion above the 15 MWs NP shall be the property of the developer.


The successful contractor will be required to submit a cutover strategy plan that identifies how electrical power will be provided to facilities during construction activities and how electrical power will be cut over from the existing system to the new.  The new wind farm shall be installed such that both systems (new & existing) can remain operational independently &/or connected together.  The maximum duration for facility outage to perform the actual cutover is limited and will require coordination with Pantex. 

We are seeking firms that would be interested in performing as the prime contractor.  If you are interested, please respond via email to Gary D. Moore, Contract Specialist, E-mail: gmoore@pantex.com  


Estimated cost range $25 million to $50 million

Interested Parties should be aware that federal stimulus funding under ARRA may become available for this project through the Department of Energy.   Up to $28 million may be provided to fund power production by wind energy for the Pantex Plant.   This could include purchase of the WTG’s and towers comprising the Wind Farm, the electrical distribution lines inter-connecting the WTG’s, and the electrical distribution lines connecting the Wind Farm to the existing Pantex Plant substation.   In the event such ARRA funding becomes available, the Request For Proposal (RFP)  will be amended to reflect appropriate changes to the scope of the project as described herein including Wind Farm ownership, lease-to-own agreements and other affected provisions.

No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.<br /></span></strong><br />BACKGROUND: &nbsp;The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) mission is to safeguard America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosives) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, and counter the threat, and mitigate its effects. DTRA's Research and Development (RD) Enterprise is the focal point for basic and applied research to identify and develop sciences and technologies to combat WMD. In March 2006, RD established the Basic and Applied Sciences Directorate (RD-BA) to foster and enable farsighted, high payoff research focused on the unique challenges related to reducing, eliminating, countering and mitigating the effects of WMD by advancing the fundamental knowledge and understanding in the sciences, facilitating the transition of basic research to the applied research stakeholders, and complementing Agency applied research efforts with university research capabilities. During the past 17 years, the Department of Defense (DoD) has supported a variety of international security-oriented activities within the framework of the DoD's Cooperative Threat Reduction program (CTR). A recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study in 2009 was conducted, at the request of Congress, to recommend ways to strengthen and expand the DoD CTR program. This study focused on a new model of the global security paradigm for cooperative threat reduction, with the additional goal of expanding the program beyond the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to engage a broader range of partners in a variety of roles. A logical extension of this NAS report is to promote "transparency" by engaging in quality research leading to publications, continual dialogue between scientists/engineers and young researchers; and foster host nation sustainment of global security initiatives. In September of 2009, RD-BA initiated a program focused on university-centric cooperative research, especially at the basic and early applied stages of science and engineering, between the United States (U.S.) and Foreign academic communities. Cooperative research promotes long-term relationships and builds capacity that can be the basis for future cooperative global security and counter-WMD activities. The initial emphasis for expanded cooperation is on global biosurveillance and early warning systems.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: Identify cooperative fundamental research to reduce the global threat of WMD in collaboration with a broad range of global research partners. This sources sought announcement involves identification of United States universities that have established partnering relationships with international universities, to address fundamental research (i.e. basic and early applied sciences) opportunities to reduce, eliminate, and counter WMD across the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Explosive (CBRNE) spectrum. The goals are to improve international collaboration to detect, characterize, and report WMD, and to advance host nation sustainment through a culture of long-term cooperation and scientific responsibility for C-WMD programs. Established, strong international relationships will foster smooth transition of C-WMD program ownership to the partnering country. Multidisciplinary research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics promotes transparency through quality research publications and continual dialogue between scientists/engineers and young researchers.</p>
<p>International university relationships would include those United States universities that have partnerships with foreign universities in Asia, Europe and Eurasia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. When responding to this announcement, provide the following information as well as concise abstract describing the relationship and the fundamental research program or project, as well as a list of key words.</p>
<p>- Name of U.S. University</p>
<p>- Name of International University, including country and region (Asia, Europe and Eurasia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa)</p>
<p>- Title and description of existing partnered Program or Project</p>
<p>- Area of fundamental research, must be one of the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Distributed Approaches to Comparative Infectious Disease Dynamics (Identify, evaluate and develop prototype applications, methodologies and approaches suited for providing a near-real time data capture and distributed services integration of potentially novel natural or manmade infectious disease-related outbreak information. Improve capacity to gain and maintain compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR))</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Infectious diseases prevalence and reporting (Characterize disease prevalence, and enhance disease incidence reporting and diagnostic capabilities)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Characterize pathogens endemic to university partner nation (Characterize viral or bacterial pathogens endemic to partner nation; conduct modern molecular studies of viral and bacterial pathogens endemic to partner nation and of interest to the mutual parties; studies will address the unique features of these agents and extrapolate these findings to help understand the emergence of new agents. Agents of interest include those on the U.S. Select Agent List (HHS/USDA) and others with syndromic similarity for differential diagnosis capability)</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration Aviation Safety Program (FAASTeam) currently communicates with and educates the world aviation community through online applications located at FAASafety.gov. Since its inception, in March 2004, this site has become the central portal through which the FAASTeam disseminates information, both electronically and through postal mail. This application currently allows the FAASTeam to alert airmen of safety events, seminars, important notices, and other safety related materials. These notifications are sent via email to registered users, and also through an automated postal mail based system to non-registered airmen. Airmen can register and manage their attendance for these activates and events online. FAASafety.gov also contains access to a large amount of online safety and training related materials and is the main focus of marketing for the FAASTeam.The system houses a number of programs and subsystems that facilitate a variety of work functions for FAASTeam Program Managers and their FAASTeam Representatives nationwide.  These include: Print Budget Management, WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program tracking, AMT Awards program administration and tracking, Lendable Asset System, National FAASTeam Directory, and a host of others. The system currently has approximately 556,000 registered users and airmen participation continues to grow at a rapid pace.

<DESC>Subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information of Planning Purpose," this announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes.  FISC Norfolk's intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide IT services for the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET), and to accomplish migration of business support and command and control (C2) systems from legacy networks to ONE-NET.  ONE-NET provides 24/7/365 NIPRNet/SIPRNet access, network connectivity and security, electronic mail and Blackberry, file and print services, voice over SIPRNet (VOSIP), web access, and desktop support via Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSCs) and the Local Network Support Centers (LNSCs) located at Fleet concentration areas throughout OCONUS.  
This 24/7/365 capability includes the functional areas of Network and Systems Operations (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Management, Network Defense (ND), Common Applications Support, and Transport Services).  Additional support extends into Service Desk, Field Services, Information Assurance, Network Technical Support, IT Service Management, Enterprise Management Support, Voice Over Internet & Telephone Support, and Theater Application Support. Through Program Executive Office (PEO) for Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), ONE-NET infrastructure is installed at fourteen (14) overseas fleet concentration areas, owned and operated by NAVY CYBERFOR. 
The ONE-NET infrastructure is comprised of three (3) TNOSCs located at Yokosuka (Japan), Naples (Italy), and Manama (Bahrain). TNOSCs function as the single point of contact for the network operations and the focal point for decisions for regional customers. These decisions involve service priorities, restoration priorities, and other enterprise-wide operational issues within their region. Service is primarily focused on Network and Systems Operations, Service Desk, Network Technical Support and Information Assurance.  The Yokosuka TNOSC services the Far East Theater and the Naples and Bahrain TNOSCs service the Europe and Middle East theaters respectively.  These three theaters are under the operational control of Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Pacific (PAC) and NCTAMS Atlantic (LANT).
LNSCs are extensions of a TNOSC where physical presence is required.  Service at this level shall be primarily hardware-related and limited to device and cable plant maintenance, component replacement, and providing the on-site touch labor to respond to service requests and system problems that cannot be resolved by the TNOSC remotely.  LNSC supports life-cycle maintenance activities and ONE-NET service level objectives by providing touch-labor associated with the refresh and warranty repair of devices attached to the ONE-NET network.
A chart of the TNOSCS, LNSCs and all applicable site locations with anticipated seat counts is available as Attachment A.
The operations model is anticipated to be two-fold.  NCTAMSPAC is expected to be a Government Owned/Contractor Operated model where the contractor provides operational support.  NCTAMSLANT is anticipated to be a Government Owned/Government Operated where the contractor provides support to augment the Government personnel performing operational support.
This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. It is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.   
NAICS CodeThe NAICS Code for this requirement is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, and the Size Standard is $25.0M.
Anticipated ContractThe proposed contract is anticipated to be a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The contract will utilize cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) / firm fixed price (FFP) pricing. The Government anticipates the award of competed task orders in response to the Government's requirement in accordance with FAR 16.505
Period of Performance The period of performance for this requirement will be a 12 month base year and four 12 month option periods.  This contract is estimated to commence on 03 January 2011.

<DESC>Request for InformationOffice of Information & Technology in support of theEmployee Education System SimLEARN Center1.	PURPOSETHIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  It is a part of the VA's OI&T (Office of Information & Technology) market research for a virtual patient authoring and delivery system for a new SimLEARN (Simulated Learning Enhancement and Advanced Research Network) national center.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Solicitation, a Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will award a contract for the items contained in this RFI.  It should be not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested, or reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI.  Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability to provide any/all of the requested information.   Based on the responses to this RFI, the government may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) at an undetermined time in the future.   Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used confidentially by the Government for the SimLEARN Center project.2.	BACKGROUNDThe Employee Education System (EES) is an administration-wide, comprehensive, virtual, education-focused organization supporting Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continuing learning objectives through all-employee training, education, performance support, development, and consultation.  SimLEARN is a new national simulation training, education and research program which is organizationally aligned under EES and will be responsible for developing the strategic vision and system-wide plan for simulation process modeling, training, education and research for VHA.  The program includes the creation of a national SimLEARN Center in 2010 in Orlando, Florida.  The planned physical layout of the national SimLEARN Center will potentially include:1)	Virtual Environment Space2)	Process Modeling Space3)	Mannequin Simulation Rooms with a control center.  The rooms will be configured to simulate a variety of hospital locations (ICU, Floor, ER, etc.) and levels of patient care.4)	A Reception Area 5)	A Task Trainers/Debriefing Room6)	A New Technology Lab7)	An Operating Room/Web Lab8)	A Library and Computer Training Room9)	Standardized Patient Rooms with a control center.  The rooms will be configured to simulate a variety of hospital locations (ICU, Floor, ER, etc.) and levels of patient care.10)	  A Conference Room11)	  Staff OfficesThe planned facility IT infrastructure of the national SimLEARN Center will potentially include:1)	One or more gig-E LAN(s) or better to support real-time simulators2)	10GE uplinks3)	Switches4)	Routers5)	Application Servers6)	Virtual Reality Support Servers7)	File and Print ServersThe SimLEARN Center also plans to include virtual patient clinical simulations (vendor yet to be determined).  A virtual patient is a computer-based clinical simulation used for medical education and assessment where the learner plays the role of a health care provider by interacting with the virtual patient. This typically includes making clinical decisions such as which diagnostic tests to obtain, determining a diagnosis, and prescribing therapy. More sophisticated virtual patients respond to learner interventions by dynamically changing and tracking performance metrics like time, cost, and patient satisfaction.  Virtual patients are not physical simulations such as standardized patient actors, mannequins, and part-task trainers. Simple computer-based cases that do not unfold based on learner input are not considered virtual patients either.3.

<DESC><p>1.0 Description<br /><br />1.1 The United States Air Force's (USAF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for FAA-certified light-emitting diode (LED) taxiway fixtures. The chosen strategy would provide an enterprise-wide, continental United States (CONUS), solution for converting taxiways from quartz/incandescent fixtures to LED fixtures. The awarded company/companies would supply the LED fixture as well as potentially manage the installation of the fixture. <br /><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />2.0 Background<br />The ESG CECC is investigating the availability of suppliers of innovative LED technology that will improve efficiencies in both energy and manpower, while at the same time, maintain or improve airfield operations on taxiways. <br /><br />The USAF operates and maintains 46 CONUS bases which maintain airfield taxiway lighting systems by in-house government and contract work forces. Current airfield lighting, which is typically quartz/incandescent, is inefficient in terms of energy consumption and associated costs for illumination and also has higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to the new LED alternative. Further, there is a higher cost for operations and maintenance associated with airfield taxiway incandescent lamps and fixtures based on their energy consumption and life expectancies. There is also the potential that LEDs could improve the situational awareness and level of guidance to the pilots since LEDs have a greater intensity, which could reduce the amount of incursions and accidents during periods of darkness and low visibility.<br /><br />In line with the Air Force's "20/20 by 2020" goal - to offset a 20% reduction in funds by achieving efficiencies and operational/spend improvements by 20% - the ESG CECC is seeking strategic suppliers of this new LED technology to replace these less efficient incandescent lamps and fixtures, and to contract the work required and/or partner with the USAF to perform the installations and related construction/electrical work on the CONUS bases, so that we can gain benefits from the transition in FY 2011. <br /><br />3.0 Requested Information<br />The primary intent of this RFI is to determine the available LED taxiway fixtures and installation options which can be sourced to meet our mission needs. We also are seeking to streamline our sourcing process and any associated training with installing/maintaining the new LEDs. <br /><br />3.1 Focus areas include but are not limited to the examples listed below:<br /><br />3.1.1 The features of your LED product in terms of energy consumption, ease of maintenance/installation, projected total cost of ownership, and compliance with FAA requirements.<br /><br />3.1.2 The ease of implementing your solution from an enterprise-wide perspective and in the required geographic scope (CONUS) for both product and installation options. See attached document for current list of potential installation locations.<br /><br />3.1.3 Your experience with similar implementations of taxiway LED fixtures, particularly at military installations.<br /><br />4.0 Responses<br /><br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI by answering the list of questions attached (4.1.1).<br /><br />4.2 Responses are due no later than 5PM EST 12 April 2010. Responses should be submitted by email to the following: <br /><br />Ms. Molly James<br />email: molly.james@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>4.3 The submitted documentation and content thereof becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request. This is a request for information announcement for planning purposes only. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. Although proposal terminology may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the Government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.<br /><br />4.4 This notice is part of Government market research. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by page, such that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.<br /><br />5.0 Industry Discussions<br />ESG CECC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.<br /><br />6.0 Questions<br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Ms. Molly James, molly.james@wpafb.af.mil. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted, accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for Control Document Index (CDI) verification and indexing at the Eastern States Office.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Eastern States Office within the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) is the custodian of the original land title records that date back to the late 1700s.  These land title records were issued by the General Land Office (GLO) starting soon after the United States became a republic.  These include plats (drawings), field notes, patents (deeds), and tract books.  
The documents are of great historical value and are often the only source that offers the identification of legal land descriptions and the transfer of property ownership from the U.S. Government to private landowners.  In 1989, the GLO Automation Records Project (GLOARP) was established.
GLO Automation Records Process (GLOARS) currently uses Internet and imaging technologies to scan, index, and access the land title data and imaged copies of the documents.  This system is a collection of subsystems consisting of the Automated Records System (ARS), for Internet access, Document Conversion System (DCS), which captures the images and data from the physical land patents, Cadastral Survey System (CSS), which captures images and data from the physical survey plats and field notes and Land Status Records System (LSR), which captures images and data from electronic images of existing Land Status records.  GLOARS is a complete document management environment.
The Bureau of Land Management requires contractor support for the indexing and verification of scanned Control Document Index into a new component of GLOARS called the CDI Application.  This new application will be integrated with the current components in the support for the DCS, CSS, LSR, and ARS applications.  The contractor will be required to verify that the scanned images reflect what is in the CDI database and maybe required to index documents or images that have not been scanned or that the data does not exist.  
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

Below is a general description of the services required.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office, Branch of Geographic Sciences, is responsible for the update and maintenance of BLMs official title, land, and mineral records.  This includes tracking federal interest in both Oregon and Washington, the production of Master Title Plats (MTP) and Historical Indices (HI), management of the tabular data stored in the Legacy Rehost system (LR2000) and the production and maintenance of the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB).

For areas with GCDB based geometry within the limits of the renewable energy priority townships; update the geometry to meet the level needed to satisfy the requirements for the Master Title Plats. The procedure will consist of evaluation of Deeds, Federal and State authority land surveys which have been filed since the creation of the GCDB townships to determine if the new information will improve the accuracy of the existing geometry. The evaluation will also determine if additional geometry is needed to satisfy the need to display additional parcels not yet present required for the MTP.  The result is intended to more accurately represent the present federal status to be depicted on the Master title plat.  
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

<p>The DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) annually assesses the high performance computing requirements of the DoD Research and Development and Test and Evaluation communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These requirements facilitate the definition of services the HPCMP provides to these communities in the form of high performance computing capability by mapping user computational applications to the stated HPC requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These requirements by application are used for a variety of purposes but most significantly as the foundation for a set of application performance benchmarks that represent the program's total computational workload.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, synthetic benchmark performance measurements are used to construct performance models of applications that can be used to predict performance of these applications on specific HPC system architectures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The HPCMP uses both application benchmarks and performance modeling to determine the optimum set of HPC systems to acquire each year.</p>
<p>The HPCMP plans to conduct a two-day HPC Performance Modeling Workshop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this workshop is to share with the community of HPC original equipment manufacturers, software developers and other communities constructing and using HPC system performance models and benchmarks the approach the HPCMP uses to measure HPC system performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A general session with all interested parties will<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>be provided to present overall performance modeling and benchmarking techniques, followed by optional individual sessions with each interested party to discuss in more specific detail performance modeling and benchmarking on HPC systems of their interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although these practices are used as a part of the evaluation during HPCMP HPC system acquisitions, this workshop is not directly associated with a specific HPCMP acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The workshop is scheduled for 11-12 May 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The general location for the workshop will be in the Washington DC or surrounding area but the facility location will not be determined until the level of interest is determined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please contact Dr. Larry Davis with the name, company/agency affiliation and title of each individual that would potentially participate in the workshop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Davis' email and phone number are <a href="mailto:larryd@hpcmo.hpc.mil">larryd@hpcmo.hpc.mil</a> and 703-812-8205.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please respond not later than 9 April 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after that deadline, respondents will be contacted and provided with the facility location and other logistical details.</p>

<DESC>National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to extend to the Information Assurance (IA) Service contract, HM1571-05-C-0002, with Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems, for up to three (3) additional option years until NGA Base Relocation and Closure (BRAC) relocation is fully operational and the BRAC related Automated Information Systems (AIS) are Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) compliant at NCE, and associated decommissioning and security clean up at six existing facilities is completed.
<p>Authority for this sole source procurement is under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. Services are deemed to be available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Three main factors support the rationale for extending the current IA Services contract: BRAC Schedule Slip, C&amp;A of BRAC Affected Systems, and Incumbent Expertise with years of practical experience of NGA mission and associated systems.</p>
<p>The contractor will monitor, investigate, and support the activities and equipment needed to safeguard NGA computer infrastructure. The contractor will provide the necessary Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) of the specialized equipment needed to provide this support. The IA contractor shall perform the functions and manage the programs, described below:<br />&bull; Program Management (PM) and Life Cycle Planning for the IA systems,<br />&bull; Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Program,<br />&bull; Information Assurance Officer Program (IAO),<br />&bull; Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program,<br />&bull; Technical Support Office (TSO) for the IA systems,<br />&bull; Vulnerability Assessment (VA) Program, and<br />&bull; Complete integration of these functions as a Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) within IA supporting the NGA Mission.</p>
<p><strong>This is not a request for proposal.</strong> Firms that recognize they can perform the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer, and provide supporting evidence to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of publication. <strong>This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.</strong> The final determination by the Government to open this requirement to competition based on any information provided is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources will be given full consideration. Only written responses will be considered. All written correspondence should be sent to Christina C. Griffin at Christina.C.Griffin@nga.mil.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  

This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and FAR Subpart 5.705.  

Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 69378 was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on September 8, 2009, in the amount of $972,566.02, including the base and all option line items. The period of performance is September 10, 2009, through May 31, 2010.

Work required under this task order will result in the delivery of all tooling and fixtures for a prototype of a shim safety rod.  The Contractor will also further update procedures and protocols based on theories established, but not tested, under the first task order.  Testing will be completed in conjunction with the fabrication of the prototype.

Modification T001 shall be executed to extend the period of performance, and incorporate a training requirement.   

The period of performance shall be changed as follows:
FROM: September 10, 2009 through May 31, 2010;
TO:   September 10, 2009 through June 24, 2010.

The Department of Commerce (DOC)/Inspector General (IG) requires that all Contractors who receive or have received contracts/ orders funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), train their employees on fraud, waste and abuse and be provided a copy of power point presentation developed by the DOC/OIG.  This modification will incorporate this task.

The total amount of the Task Order shall remain unchanged.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii), this modification is being executed  against a task order awarded on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract and all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with SPECS Surface Nano Analysis, Inc., 20 Cabot Blvd. Suite 300, Mansfield, MA 02048.
<p>This requirement is for a dual phase locked loop oscillation control system which is required to provide accurate detection and control of a mechanically vibrated AFM sensor for NIST research on dynamic mode nanomechanical property measurement. The system must integrate two oscillation controllers that operate synchronously in detecting and controlling two independent modulation signals in the range from 100Hz to 5 MHz with a resolution of 5pHz. The system must also utilize Labview programming interfacing to be compatible with NIST existing research AFM instrumentation. The required characteristics and measurement capabilities are only found in the Spec Nanonis Dual-OC4 system and could not be found in any other commercial instrument dedicated for the fine control of mechanical oscillations. The hardware and software are proprietary to Nanonis GmbH and the required dynamic AFM measurement capability cannot be provided by any other source.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other source that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide these services. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, FL intends to increase the ceiling on contract N65886-07-D-0001 with Tyonek Services Corporation. This increase is necessary due to continued escalation in work due to the Global War on Terror efforts and will allow for uninterrupted performance until a follow-on contract can be awarded. The contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Time and Material Provisions for support services to augment the Government workforce performing Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) work on aircraft and rework of associated components/materials. The current ceiling price will be exhausted in August 2010. This increase will cover a period of 2 months until the follow on contract is awarded in October 2010. Therefore, the requirement being synopsized here would be a 4 months effort when including the 2 months mobilization needed for a new contractor to assume the work. This sole source action is being requested in order for the FRCSE to have uninterrupted services until the recompeted contract is awarded.

Any firms believing they can provide these services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the services provided and without causing an interruption of critical services. The firm’s response should also illustrate how it can overcome the start-up costs necessary to assume this effort in the short period of performance that this synopsis represents.

The contract was originally solicited as a competitive procurement action pursuant to Section 8(a), of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637 (a)) and FAR 19.805. The NAICS Code is 336413 and the FSC/PSC Code is J015.
The procurement was a 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms whose numbers of employees did not exceed 1000. 

If firms are interested in the follow-on effort, a Sources Sought was completed on 29 June 2009 and the synopsis for this effort is expected to be published in March 2010. The resultant contract will be set-aside for an 8 (a) Small Business.

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center San Diego intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5 to Harris Corporation dba Harris RF Communication, 1680 University Avenue, Rochester, NY 14610-1839 for 6 each Radio Assy. MBHH, HB Suite B, GPS; P/N: RF-310M-HH006 and 2 each Cable Assy. MBHH Field Programming; P/N: 12041-7220-A1.  The radios are the only radios available that are compatible with existing VRC-110 Harris Amplifiers.  The command currently has all Harris VRC-110 Amplifiers in its fleet of 50 tactical vehicles that utilize these radios.  The Harris AN/PRC-152 is the only radio that has the exact look, feel, weight, compatibility and is the only suitable radio for training EOD students.  All other tactical radios do not use any of the PRC-152 interfaces or accessories currently on hand.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, and in conjunction with the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expeditionary Support Unit One's standardization program, only this specific make and model of technical equipment will satisfy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expeditionary Support Unit One's need for additional radios or replacement items.  Only one source is available to provide the radios and cable programming.  The radios and cable programming are commercial items.  Commercial procedures as outlined in FAR 12 and 13.5 are applicable.  This notice constitutes a Request for Quotations.  No other solicitation will be issued.  The closing time and date is 12:00 P.M. (PST), Tuesday, 30 March 2010.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Other brand names are not sought because any deviation from this brand name manufacturer would cost the Navy substantial amount of money in converting existing systems, not to mention the additional cost to re- training thousands of sailors on a new system.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and will be advised as to how to submit their product(s) for future evaluation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received by the closing date of the Request for Quotation set forth above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Point of Contact is Charles (Fletch) Fletcher II at phone number (619) 532-2658, fax number (619) 532-1088 or e-mail charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil.

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE EXISTING EPA CONTRACT-HOLDER THAT HAS BEEN AWARDED AN EPA LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK (LUST) REMEDIATION IN INDIAN COUNTRY CONTRACT
<p>The purpose of this Work Assignment is to obligate $5,000.00 for the Chief's Place and White Earth Grocery projects. The period of performance for this work is from August 13, 2009 to September 28, 2011. This work will require the contractor to conduct site assessment/ characterization to determine the Geology/hydrogeology of the sites, Nature and the extent of contamination, and Migration pathways and points of exposure.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>RECOVERY: </strong>Orlando, Florida, Industry Day: Modernization of the George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building</p>
<p>On Wednesday August 19, 2009, The United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors, for the construction phase of The George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building, Orlando, Florida. The Industry Day, or Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session, will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the:</p>
<p>The Sheraton Orlando Downtown Hotel<br />60 South Ivanhoe Boulevard<br />Orlando, Florida 32804<br />Hotel Tel: (407) 425-4455<br />Room: Anderson/Delaney.</p>
<p>The Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services contract for the project was awarded to Skanska USA Building Inc. in the amount of $35,000,000. In an effort to facilitate the Small Business Community participation in the construction of the main building project, Small Businesses are invited to network with Skanska as they continue to enter into agreements with qualified subcontractors.</p>
<p>The George C. Young Federal Building and Courthouse (FB-CT) is located at 80 North Hughey Avenue on the western border of Orlando's Central Business District. The FB-CT is located on the north-east corner of a 3.5 acre lot, co-located and connected to the new courthouse annex and parking garage.</p>
<p>The project is a major repair and full modernization of the 182,000 square foot FB-CT. The FB-CT constructed in 1975 has a square foot print and is six floors above grade with a full basement. The overall goal of the project is to convert the facility into a "high-performance green building", meeting the requirements of LEED program, Silver status.</p>
<p>Work items include: Modernization and upgrades to the public toilets, public spaces and space reconfiguration to meet tenant requirements. Replacement of Air Handling Units, Fan Coil Units, ductwork and insulation. Renovation and upgrades of the plumbing, lighting and fire protection systems. Replacement of the elevator cab finishes and controls and removal of asbestos containing materials in the buildings.</p>
<p>This Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialog between that community, GSA and the construction firms that have been selected for this project. Skanska, the Construction Manager as constructor (CMc) firm selected for this project submitted a Subcontracting Plan prior to contract award demonstrating a commitment to awarding a target estimated value of $11,214,602 within the following categories: Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including 8(a) - 8%; Woman-Owned Small Businesses - 5%; HubZone Businesses - 3%; Small Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses - 3%; Veteran-owned Small Business Concerns - 3% of the planned subcontracting dollars.</p>
<p>Prospective Small Business Subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with Skanska, GSA and other firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors. Although it is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist Skanska in identifying qualified subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals listed above for this project, because GSA is not permitted by law to be a part to contractual relationships between potential Prime and Subcontractors, any contracts that may be entered into as a result of this Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.</p>
<p>Questions about this Industry Day should be directed to David Gibson, GSA's Small Business Advocate, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail: DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV</p>

<DESC>Notice to Suppliers to Register in USPS eSourcing

All suppliers interested in doing business with the U.S. Postal Service should register their organization in the Supplier Registration module of the USPS eSourcing solution. Registration provides suppliers the opportunity to ensure their organization is included in this extensive supplier database.

USPS eSourcing is a web-based electronic solicitation and reverse auction application that automates, standardizes, and streamlines the sourcing of supplies, services, equipment, transportation, and facilities. The solution is also utilized as one additional method for USPS to search for viable suppliers.  

Supplier registration provides suppliers eligibility to participate in USPS eSourcing events. Suppliers can access the solution at https://uspsesourcing.emptoris.com. Once on the landing page, simply click on the “Register Supplier Organization” hyperlink to begin the registration process. Suppliers are encouraged to review the eSourcing Supplier Registration Guide (located at http://www.usps.com/suppliers/howto/registration.htm) prior to starting the registration process.  This guide provides insight to completing the registration entry. 

Once a supplier completes the registration process, the Postal Service will review the entry within one (1) business day to ensure it is complete and accurate. Upon approval, the supplier will be notified via e-mail of their log-in credentials.

USPS eSourcing event opportunities are not posted within USPS eSourcing. Suppliers should continue to check FEDBIZOPPS (www.fbo.gov) to learn of any USPS opportunities that may be available. When suppliers find an opportunity that is of interest, they should contact the USPS contracting official for that specific opportunity to express their desire to participate in the eSourcing event. The USPS contracting official can then invite the supplier to participate when the event officially opens. 

Information about doing business with the Postal Service is available at www.usps.com/suppliers/welcome.htm

Send questions or comments on supplier registration to:  esourcing@usps.gov

<p>2. DISPUTES (NOV 2005)</p>
<p>a. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute or claim concerning this contract which is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting Officer, who shall state his decision in writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy of it to the Contractor. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor may appeal by mailing or otherwise furnishing to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, and the decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive; provided that if no such appeal is filed, the decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive. The Contractor shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of any appeal under this clause. Pending final decision on such a dispute, however, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the contract and in accordance with the decision of the Contracting Officer unless directed to do otherwise by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. Contractors shall provide the certification specified below when submitting any claim. Any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim may execute the certification.</p>

<p>c. This "Disputes" clause does not preclude consideration of law questions in connection with decisions provided for in paragraph "a" above, provided, that nothing in this contract shall be construed as making final the decision of any administrative official, representative, or board on a question of law.</p>
<p>3. LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>
<p>5. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS (JAN 2005) - This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the Contracting Officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three years after the final payment.</p>
<p>6. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.</p>
<p>b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.</p>
<p>c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-</p>
<p>(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).</p>
<p>(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.</p>
<p>d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any</p>
<p>(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.</p>
<p>e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract.

<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.</p>

<p>17. TAXES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p>b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)</p>
<p>a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>
<p>b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.</p>
<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.<br />20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.</p>
<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.</p>
<p>b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):</p>
<p>a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following:</p>

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97 177):</p>
<p>(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. <br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. <br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received. When the notice is in writing, it shall be considered made on the date shown on the notice.</p>
<p>23. ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER PAYMENTS (AUG 2007) - Federal law 31 USC requires Federal payments to be made by electronic fund transfer.

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

<SUBJECT>Modification to Contract HHSN276200800005C
<SOLNBR>NLM-10-83SB
<RESPDATE>033110
<CONTACT>Sally Boakye, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email boakyes@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP)<br /><br />It it is the intent of the National Institutes of Health to modify contract No. HHSN276200800005C on a sole source basis.<br /><br />The Contractor, Brogan &amp; Partners,&nbsp;shall contract with Texterity to use technology to convert the printed page into vivid online text and imagery and add reader-friendly features to appeal to today's growing market of online and mobile readers; provide journal issues in Published Web Format (PWF), a plug-in, web-based solution; produce outstanding visual quality equal to that of the print version of EHP, including color, clarity and impact. Digital version should allow readers to search for topics in the issue, or click on links and transport additional background information or indexing information. The digital version's hierarchical table-of-contents, embedded page links, and phrase search and highlighting will make it easy to quickly access the articles or advertisements readers choose themselves. It shall also enable readers to clip pages and save them, or even forward them to share with colleagues. Neither a PDF nor a web page, the online solution will offer the advantages of higher circulation, increased revenue, stronger brands and increase readership. Ultimately, Texterity will distribute the locked versions of EHP subscriptions that are sold through Brogan and Partners as our contracted source for distribution.
<p>The Contractor currently procures the selected graphics for each issue of the journal and sets up the journal files for print and distribution by an outside vendor. After the print file is created some modification is necessary in order for the file to be sent to Texterity. In addition, the graphics that Brogan has purchased have copyrights to them so when they purchase, they get a quote for our online version and print versions. It is cost- effective for them to get another addition for the digital version rather than the government having to purchase them for distribution. It would cost the government the original fee since it is their first purchase of the graphic.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall arrange the production and delivery of unlocked digital versions of the journal and possibly special issues that may not be printed but produced solely as digital for cost savings, starting with volume year number 118, issue no 01, January 2010. With the exception of the January, February, March and April 2010 issues, all issues of the digital version will be delivered to EHP prior to the first of each month. No one digital edition of the journal will exceed a total of 228 pages including the cover pages. The digital version of the journal will be an exact replica of the issue currently being printed. However, there are alterations that have to be done to the files before they can be sent to Texterity for conversion. The Contractor currently handles all of the production files for EHP and will, in turn, make the requested changes for it to be convertible through Texterity. This task will be issued under task number 4 of the Contract, Production, starting with the January 2010 issue.</p>
<p>All deliverables may be subject to Editor in Chief and/or Project Officer approvals prior to final delivery.</p>
<p>Distribution of the unlocked digital version shall be handled by Brogan and Partners using current personnel paid under the fixed price of this contract therefore there are no new costs incurred for distribution. Distribution of the locked versions will be handled by Brogan and Partners by procuring Texterity's distribution services.</p>
<p><br />Optional Task<br />EHP Special Issues<br />The Government reserves the right to request conversion, production and or delivery of PWF for special issues at its discretions. The Special issues would be handled the same as regular issues. EHP provides content for the issue and contractor provides lay-out and production of the product. Materials provided by the contractor undergo a series of in-house reviews by EHP staff at various stages of production and ultimate approval by NIEHS management before publication. Finally the Contractor would procure services of Texterity to convert files and create digital version. Unlocked versions will be distributed by Brogan and locked versions will be distributed by Texterity through their procurement with Brogan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is not a RFP nor is an RFP available.&nbsp; All interested parties which can demonstrate their capabilities to provide the aforementioned modification may submit electronic responses to SAlly Boakye at <a href="mailto:boakyes@mail.nih.gov">boakyes@mail.nih.gov</a>.&nbsp; Response must be received no later than 12:00 PM Easter, on March 31, 2010.&nbsp; Please reference notice number NLM-10-83 on all correspondence to this notice.</p>

The following local clauses are incorporated by full text:
Contractor Access to (Unclassified) Information Systems (Sep 2008)(NAVSUP)																Department of Navy (DON) policy prescribes that all unclassified data at rest that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devices shall be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology.  A contractor employee, whose work involves access to sensitive unclassified information, warrants a judgment of	trustworthiness.  Therefore, each contractor employee will have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) to ensure the contractor employee assigned to the command will have an investigation equivalent to the National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC).  This investigation must be current within 10 years.								DON will no longer permit the assignment of non-U.S. citizen contractor personnel to IT-I and IT-II designated positions.  Requests to waive the U.S. citizenship requirement for designated IT-II	positions may be submitted through the command Security Manager to CNO (N09N2).  IT position designations are incorporated in paragraph 5B-2 of SECNAV M-5510.30.								For contractor personnel who currently have a favorably adjudicated NACLC, the Facility Security Officer (FSO) will use the visitor certification program in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a visit authorization request (VAR) to provide the individuals' investigative information to the Security Manager of the command visited.  The contractor will include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each person designated on a VAR.  The VAR will be renewed annuallyor for the duration of the contract if less than one year.
The contractor FSO or security representative will ensure that individuals assigned to the command are U.S. citizens and will ensure completion of the SF-85P.  The SF-85P along with the original signed release statements and two applicant fingerprint cards (FD 258) will be forwarded to the command Security Manager for receipt at least one week prior to reporting for duty.  The responsibility for providing the fingerprint cards rests with the contractor.  The Security Manager will review the form for completeness, accuracy and suitability issues.  The completed SF 85P alongwith attachments will be forwarded to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who will conduct the NACI investigation.  All contractor personnel will in-process with the Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the command and will out-process prior to their departure.  The completed SF-85P will be reviewed by the Security Manager for completeness, accuracy and suitability prior to submission.  If the contractor appears suitable after the questionnaire has been reviewed, the request will be forwarded to OPM.  If there are eligibility issues, the FSO will be advised that the contractor is unacceptable by the Security Manager. OPNAV Form 5239/14, the System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N), is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
Failure to provide the required SF-85P, signed release statements, fingerprint cards and the SAAR-N at least one week prior to the individuals' report date will result in delaying the reporting date.  Personnel cannot be properly processed and provided system access prior to their reporting date without receiving the investigative paperwork one week prior.
Once the investigation is complete, the results are forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  The DONCAF determination will appear in JPAS as either "Favorable" or "No Determination Made."  Decisions of "No Determination Made" indicate that significant derogatory information is present that prevents a favorable suitability determination. Please note that the determination of the DONCAF is final; there is no due processaccommodation for positions of trust.  That decision is final.  If the determination is "No Determination Made," the contractor employee will not be permitted to continue on the contract and will be removed immediately.			
In order to maintain access to required systems, the contractor shall ensure completion of annual Information Assurance (IA) training, monitor expiration of requisite background investigations, and initiate reinvestigations as required.

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before April 16, 2010.

BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below.  In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter’s technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.  

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.    

Factor 1 – Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements.  Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter’s ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, lodging, and secured storage.  Quotations must address the quoter’s ability to comply with the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking.  Quotations should reflect the quality of services provided and maintained.  (b) Availability of Dates.  Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested.  Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date.  (c) Location.  Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the following U.S. Postal Code areas: 60193; 60194; 60015; 60522; 60521; 60601; 60603; 60610; 60611; 60004; 60005; 60192; 60143; 60069; 60523; 60181; 60173, or 60195, with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters.  Site Visits:  The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable.  The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.  

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years.  The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client’s program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided.  EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and décor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc).  In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating. 

Factor 3 – Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate.  Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates.  

Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the quoter’s initial quote should contain the quoter’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52  Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services—Certification, apply to this acquisition.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 08 APR 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 08 APR 2010. Contact Sheila Midgette at 252-335-6493 or Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Provide a list of no more than three (3) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract. Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survery will be provided to the references provided. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the statement of work.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the statement of work</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each <br />company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in <br />accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p><br />(d) Completed performance surveys are not to be reviewed by the offeror. ONCE THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED, IT IS CONSIDERED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, and is only viewed by Government personnel directly involved in the evaluation process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performnace information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, credentials, magnitude of work (meaning size of church, number of choirs, breadth of experience), flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs, ability of contractor to work and respond kindly to various types of people, and the ability to respond to needs that are specific to the Protestant Evangelical faith.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower and it is in the best interest of the government to do so. <br />i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.</p>

<DESC>Amendment two 

Regarding:  Clarification on what equipment the Forest Service has available for off-loading at both delivery locations 

The Glacier Ranger District has a small front end loader that can off load lumber if the pallets are under 2000 lbs.  The 2000 pound limit is the upper limit when off loading a semi trailer. The other limiting factor is the height of the stacked pallets of lumber.  The pallets would need to be less than 8 ft off the driving surface.  If the stacks are too tall, Forest Service equipment will not be able to safely off load.  Because of these limitations, delivery drivers should bring their own fork lift.  

The Cordova Ranger District has equipment available to off load trucks and the load limit is 1,500 pounds max per bundle.  

The response date for this solicitation has not changed.

<CONTACT>Molly James, Contract Specialist, Email molly.james@wpafb.af.mil - Christopher L. Muntz, Contract Specialist, Email christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>1.0 Description<br /><br />1.1 The United States Air Force's (USAF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC) is in the process of&nbsp;determining a sourcing strategy&nbsp;for FAA-certified light-emitting diode (LED) taxiway fixtures. The chosen strategy would provide an enterprise-wide, continental United States (CONUS), solution for converting taxiways from quartz/incandescent fixtures to LED fixtures. The awarded company/companies would supply the LED fixture as well as potentially manage the installation of the fixture. <br /><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />2.0 Background<br />The ESG CECC is investigating the availability of suppliers of innovative LED technology that will improve efficiencies in both energy and manpower, while at the same time, maintain or improve airfield operations on taxiways. <br /><br />The USAF operates and maintains 46 CONUS bases which maintain airfield taxiway lighting systems by in-house government and contract work forces. Current airfield lighting, which is typically quartz/incandescent, is inefficient in terms of energy consumption and associated costs for illumination and also has higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to the new LED alternative. Further, there is a higher cost for operations and maintenance associated with airfield taxiway incandescent lamps and fixtures based on their energy consumption and life expectancies. There is also the potential that LEDs could improve the situational awareness and level of guidance to the pilots since LEDs have a greater intensity, which could reduce the amount of incursions and accidents during periods of darkness and low visibility.<br /><br />In line with the Air Force's "20/20 by 2020" goal - to offset a 20% reduction in funds by achieving efficiencies and operational/spend improvements by 20% - the ESG CECC is seeking strategic suppliers of this new LED technology to replace these less efficient incandescent lamps and fixtures, and to contract the work required and/or partner with the USAF to perform the installations and related construction/electrical work on the CONUS bases, so that we can gain benefits from the transition in FY 2011. <br /><br />3.0 Requested Information<br />The primary intent of this RFI is to determine the available LED taxiway fixtures and installation options which can be sourced to meet our mission needs. We also are seeking to streamline our sourcing process and any associated training with installing/maintaining the new LEDs. <br /><br />3.1 Focus areas include but are not limited to the examples listed below:<br /><br />3.1.1 The features of your LED product in terms of energy consumption, ease of maintenance/installation, projected total cost of ownership, and compliance with FAA requirements.<br /><br />3.1.2 The ease of implementing your solution from an enterprise-wide perspective and in the required geographic scope (CONUS) for both product and installation options. See attached document for current list of potential installation locations.<br /><br />3.1.3 Your experience with similar implementations of taxiway LED fixtures, particularly at military installations.<br /><br />4.0 Responses<br /><br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI by answering the list of questions attached (4.1.1).<br /><br />4.2 Responses are due no later than 5PM EST 12 April 2010. Responses should be submitted by email to the following: <br /><br />Ms. Molly James<br />email: molly.james@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>4.3 The submitted documentation and content thereof becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request. This is a request for information announcement for planning purposes only. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. Although proposal terminology may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the Government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.<br /><br />4.4 This notice is part of Government market research. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by page, such that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.<br /><br />5.0 Industry Discussions<br />ESG CECC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.<br /><br />6.0 Questions<br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Ms. Molly James, molly.james@wpafb.af.mil. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted, accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 2 April 2010 will be answered.<br /><br />7.0 Summary<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. It is intended to identify sources that can provide alternatives for sourcing LED airfield taxiway lighting and the associated installation thereof.<br /><br />The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Air Force has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<CONTACT>Deborah J Bullard, Senior Supervisor, Phone 303-384-6876, Fax 303-275-3109, Email deborah_bullard@nrel.gov
<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has a principal task to conduct research and development (R&D) for the next generation of technologies in support of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies and Vehicle Technologies Programs.  NREL’s support for the DOE programs integrates research and development, assessment of technology, manufacturing, and commercialization status and readiness, cross-cutting manufacturing R&D, market transformation, technical validation, computer modeling, outreach and other activities.  In addition to value-added work on fuel cells and other alternative fuel technologies, the integration of these technologies with other renewable energy technologies, and dissemination of the information is of increasing importance. 

NREL seeks sources to assist NREL in supporting the DOE and industry across these integrated activities on an as needed basis. The support required is excellent technical writing, communication, and customer service skills, working knowledge of alternative fuels and fuel cell technologies, and the ability to assist NREL with identifying future work needed to move the technologies forward.  The main focus is on fuel cell manufacturing and analysis/modeling.  The codes and standards focus is minimal.  Activities are anticpated to be participation in meetings and reporting back to NREL as well as participation in outreach activities to help improve those activities.

The effort will include the following:
Meet with industry and other pertinent organizations to gather research, technology, manufacturing, and commercialization information, as well as other information as requested;  Provide technical support to NREL; Report findings to NREL on a regular basis, as well as on an as-requested basis.

Type of effort is envisioned as follows:
Analysis:
1.	Perform analysis of codes and standards to identify gaps and make recommendations about how these gaps could be addressed
2.	Perform computational analyses, such as modeling analyses, to evaluate hazards and definite prevention and mitigation strategies
3.	Provide assistance on analysis of real-world stationary fuel cell installations to better inform stakeholders about both potential benefits and potential financial and technological risks.  These installations will include, but are not limited to, backup power, combined heat and power, and combined heat, hydrogen and power, and biogas installations.  
4.	Techno-economic analysis involving the use of the Fuel Cell Power model, as well as any other analytic support models needed to better understand particular installations or larger energy systems, such as use of hydrogen in vehicles or electricity arbitrage scenarios.  
5.	Collaborate with NREL to characterize a set of hydrogen vehicle deployment scenarios that account for hypothetical advances in particular technologies as well as adoption of commercialization strategies by particular stakeholders.  The analytic support will include, but is not limited to, cost estimation and infrastructure component performance estimates, spatial optimization of infrastructure rollout on a national scale, and economic analysis of multiple vehicle and fuel technologies competing in the light duty vehicle market under a range of policy conditions. 
6.	Quantitative assessment of a future carbon-constrained scenario in which multiple advanced vehicle and fuel technologies compete both within the household vehicle market and in related markets such as heavy duty vehicles, chemicals, distributed power and large-scale low-carbon electricity generation and storage.  The viability of different pathways will be assessed in terms of changes in cost and performance attributes over time and potential revenue streams from different future markets.  
7.	Develop and apply a spatial optimization model to project the cost and performance at a component level of future infrastructure developments needed for various biomass to vehicle fuel pathways.  The cost optimization routine must take into account the spatial distribution of existing biomass resources, limitations on potential locations of facility installations, changes in system performance and cost over time and the future spatial variation in fuel demand. The optimization model will be used to provide input to large scale infrastructure rollout studies, and will be developed in collaboration with NREL researchers to represent the future implications of meeting or not meeting particular technology and cost goals.

Data Collection:
1.	Perform tests or collect data required to support the development of codes and standards.
2.	Assist NREL in understanding manufacturing needs of various types of fuel cells, by gathering and assessing information from industry, academia, and other national labs.

Technical Support:
1.	Participate in the codes and standards development process by attending   meetings, coordinating projects, and helping draft codes and standards text.
2.	Provide technical input to the codes and standards test laboratory.
3.	Assist NREL in providing technical support to DOE’s Market Transformation activity, including supporting DOE at conferences and meetings, in developing planning and program documents, and in facilitating the specification, purchase, and installation of fuel cells and other hydrogen technologies at federal government facilities.
4.	Assist NREL in providing technical support in the area of fuel cell R&D to the DOE Fuel Cell Technologies program office.
5.	Assist NREL in providing technical support in the area of fuel cell manufacturing to the DOE Fuel Cell Technologies program office.
6.	Assist NREL by directly engaging with stakeholders and collaborating on both analysis of particular installations and development of case studies for publication as NREL reports. Material for the case studies will involve identification of technological and institutional barriers to deployment.  
7.	Provide NREL with feedback on how to revise the Fuel cell Power model to improve the representation of technological systems and to provide useful and relevant information to stakeholders and decision makers.
8.	Help in the development of outreach products such as workshops, web training materials, fact sheets, and videos

In order to determine qualifications of interested sources, please provide evidence of the following:
1.	Extensive computational and modeling software applications knowledge
2.	Database maintenance, development, and analysis capabilities
3.	Knowledge of codes and standards development processes
4.	Excellent communication and writing skills
5.	Experience and knowledge of fuel cell manufacturing and analysis
Preferred:
1.	Experience working with government officials
2.	Experience working with the public and outreach activities for the purpose of educating and/or disseminating information.

<DESC>Quotations for Solicitation AG-024B-S-10-0008 are due on 13 April by 4PM MT.


Project Description: The contractor will be responsible for bringing together a diverse team with expertise in the areas of wildland fire management, land management, risk management, and wildfire suppression strategies.  The contractor will recruit skilled personnel from other land management and response agencies, and possibly other countries, to review the agency’s response to wildfires.  This might include specialists from the military, academia, industry, and emergency agencies for expertise in land management, wildland fire management, risk management, and large field operations involving ground and air assets and catastrophic threats to the public. 

The contractor will coordinate and oversee the work of the Independent Panel. The panel is tasked with examining and reporting on fire suppression costs for wildfire incidents during Fiscal Year 2009 where federal expenditures exceeded $10,000,000.  The panel’s purpose will be to determine if the agency exercised fiscal diligence in managing specific incident suppression activities.  This panel is not expected to complete an exhaustive fiscal audit of all incident phases.  Rather, the focus will be on evaluating how these large fires were managed.   The Review objectives for this year’s panel should focus, as possible, on the following areas:

•Evaluating the risk-based management of these large fires from a systems standpoint – from planning and decision-making through implementation and the outcomes that resulted.  For each of these stages, people, skills, and technology should be assessed and what in the system worked well and what in the system needs to be improved should be identified.

•Assessing the utilization of new processes, guidance, expectations and tools that have changed the business of fire management in recent years in an effort to determine the impact these changes have had and develop a baseline for comparison in future years as these efforts mature.

•Determining whether the agency’s current review process is yielding positive changes and identifying ways to improve the agency’s current fire review processes.

If the panel finds instances where the agency may not have executed prudent fiscal decisions with respect to public/firefighter safety, natural resource, and private property protection, estimate the proportions of appropriate and excess suppression costs (recognizing that “excess costs’ would be earmarked for return to the treasury based on end of fiscal year 2009 balances). 

Summarize findings in a report to the Secretary of Agriculture.


Participation: This project is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acqusition is 541620. The small business size standard is $7.0 million average income over the last three years.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, FL intends to increase the ceiling on contract N65886-07-D-0001 with Tyonek Services Corporation. This increase is necessary due to continued escalation in work due to contingency operations and will allow for uninterrupted performance until a follow-on contract can be awarded. The contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Time and Material Provisions for support services to augment the Government workforce performing Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) work on aircraft and rework of associated components/materials. The current ceiling price will be exhausted in August 2010. This increase will cover a period of 8 months until the follow on contract is awarded in February 2011. Therefore, the requirement being synopsized here would be an 8 months effort including the 2 months mobilization needed for a new contractor to assume the work. This sole source action is being requested in order for the FRCSE to have uninterrupted services until the recompeted contract is awarded.
<p>This is an update to a previous synopsis posted on January 27, 2010 for the same effort.</p>
<p>Any firms believing they can provide these services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the services provided and without causing an interruption of critical services. The firm's response should also illustrate how it can overcome the start-up costs necessary to assume this effort in the short period of performance that this synopsis represents.</p>
<p>The contract was originally solicited as a competitive procurement action pursuant to Section 8(a), of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637 (a)) and FAR 19.805. The NAICS Code is 336413 and the FSC/PSC Code is J015.<br />The procurement was a 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms whose numbers of employees did not exceed 1000.</p>
<p>If firms are interested in the follow-on effort, a Sources Sought was completed on 29 June 2009 and the synopsis for this effort is expected to be published in July 2010. The resultant contract will be set-aside for an 8 (a) Small Business.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>RECOVERY: </strong>Orlando, Florida, Industry Day: Modernization of the George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building</p>
<p>On Wednesday August 19, 2009, The United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors, for the construction phase of The George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building, Orlando, Florida. The Industry Day, or Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session will be conducted from 6 PM&nbsp;to 8 PM, with registration&nbsp;from 5 PM to 6&nbsp;PM&nbsp;at the:</p>
<p>The Sheraton Orlando Downtown Hotel<br />60 South Ivanhoe Boulevard<br />Orlando, Florida 32804<br />Hotel Tel: (407) 425-4455<br />Room: Anderson/Delaney.</p>
<p>The Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services contract for the project was awarded to Skanska USA Building Inc. in the amount of $35,000,000. In an effort to facilitate the Small Business Community participation in the construction of the main building project, Small Businesses are invited to network with Skanska as they continue to enter into agreements with qualified subcontractors.</p>
<p>The George C. Young Federal Building and Courthouse (FB-CT) is located at 80 North Hughey Avenue on the western border of Orlando's Central Business District. The FB-CT is located on the north-east corner of a 3.5 acre lot, co-located and connected to the new courthouse annex and parking garage.</p>
<p>The project is a major repair and full modernization of the 182,000 square foot FB-CT. The FB-CT constructed in 1975 has a square foot print and is six floors above grade with a full basement. The overall goal of the project is to convert the facility into a "high-performance green building", meeting the requirements of LEED program, Silver status.</p>
<p>Work items include: Modernization and upgrades to the public toilets, public spaces and space reconfiguration to meet tenant requirements. Replacement of Air Handling Units, Fan Coil Units, ductwork and insulation. Renovation and upgrades of the plumbing, lighting and fire protection systems. Replacement of the elevator cab finishes and controls and removal of asbestos containing materials in the buildings.</p>
<p>This Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialog between that community, GSA and the construction firms that have been selected for this project. Skanska, the Construction Manager as constructor (CMc) firm selected for this project submitted a Subcontracting Plan prior to contract award demonstrating a commitment to awarding a target estimated value of $11,214,602 within the following categories: Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including 8(a) - 8%; Woman-Owned Small Businesses - 5%; HubZone Businesses - 3%; Small Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses - 3%; Veteran-owned Small Business Concerns - 3% of the planned subcontracting dollars.</p>
<p>Prospective Small Business Subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with Skanska, GSA and other firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors. Although it is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist Skanska in identifying qualified subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals listed above for this project, because GSA is not permitted by law to be a part to contractual relationships between potential Prime and Subcontractors, any contracts that may be entered into as a result of this Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.</p>
<p>Questions about this Industry Day should be directed to David Gibson, GSA's Small Business Advocate, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail: DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management utilized BPA L10PA00578 and awarded the subject task to Premier Data Services.  Below is a description of the requirement.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office, Branch of Geographic Sciences, is responsible for the update and maintenance of BLMs official title, land, and mineral records.  This includes tracking federal interest in both Oregon and Washington, the production of Master Title Plats (MTP) and Historical Indices (HI), management of the tabular data stored in the Legacy Rehost system (LR2000) and the production and maintenance of the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB).  This Statement of Work includes the creation and or maintenance of parcel level geometry of existing GCDB data to support MTP production in areas where GCDB based geometry exists.  
For areas with GCDB based geometry within the limits of the renewable energy priority townships; update the geometry to meet the level needed to satisfy the requirements for the Master Title Plats. The procedure will consist of evaluation of Deeds, Federal and State authority land surveys which have been filed since the creation of the GCDB townships to determine if the new information will improve the accuracy of the existing geometry. The evaluation will also determine if additional geometry is needed to satisfy the need to display additional parcels not yet present required for the MTP.  The result is intended to more accurately represent the present federal status to be depicted on the Master title plat.

<DESC>Contractor Requirements:
<p>The contractor shall provide eighty Applied Biosystems Taqman MicroRNA Arrays.</p>
<p>Unique features of the Applied Biosystems TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays include:</p>
<p>1.)	Reaction vessel uses microfluidic technology in a 384-well plate format.<br />2.)	The reaction vessel has 8 sample loading ports and must use centrifugation to distribute the samples into each of the 48 wells serviced by each port.<br />3.)	The reaction vessel is compatible with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System (a real-time PCR instrument).  NCI already has this system in the lab, so there is no need to purchase additional equipment. <br />4.)	The reaction vessel is pre-loaded with pre-designed 5'-nuclease assays using TaqMan&reg; probes. <br />a. 	The assay contains the necessary primers and probes to perform both reverse transcription of the 	targeted miRNA, and real time PCR detection of that miRNA transcript only. <br />b.  	The assay id specific for the mature form of the miRNA transcript.<br />c.	The real time PCR detection method includes TaqMan&reg; probes (5' nuclease chemistry) with MGB 	quenching the 3' end of the probe.<br />d.	The TaqMan&reg; probe is cleaved when the probe hybridizes to the target.<br />e.	The assay has a minimum dynamic range of 6 logs.<br />5.)	The vendor shall supply all the necessary consumables to perform real-time quantitative PCR, including PCR reagents designed for use with the fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay. All PCR reagents contain a passive internal reference dye to minimize well-to-well variability.<br />6.)	The vendor shall provide comprehensive assay design and development guidelines for real-time quantitative PCR.<br />7.)	The vendor shall offer Telephone Technical Support and Field Applications/Sales/Service Support to help solve chemistry and instrumentation problems encountered with real-time quantitative PCR.<br />8.)	High specificity: single base pair discrimination of mature miRNA.<br />9.)	Sensitivity: single copy of target<br />10.)	Linear Dynamic Range: 7-9 logs of linear dynamic range<br />11.)	Ease of use: Easily implementable on existing 7900HT, with only 2 steps that take approximately 3-10 minutes total hands on time average per sample when operating in high throughput (15-30 minutes per sample hands on time in low throughput)<br />12.)	Low sample input: Ability to assess single cells or low cell population (Non-biased assessment of single cells with the TaqMan Array). Ability to do Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), FFPE (Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded) tissues, and every other tissue with minimally 1 cell and no limitation on abundant sample.<br />13.)	Highly parallel miRNA profiling/detection in the TaqMan Array Cards (TLDA) with TaqMan miRNA Gold Standard Assays</p>
<p>These Arrays must be compatible with the 7900HT Real-Time PCR machine and Sorvall Legend RT+ centrifuge.</p>
<p><br />Brand name justification:  Use of a different platform would result in a decrease of sensitivity and specificity.  Further, alternate platforms would require procurement of additional, costly equipment and re-training of staff.</p>

<DESC><strong>RECOVERY:</strong>&nbsp; "Lung Health Study (LHS)" - This is a case-cohort study of approximately 2,170 symtomatic asthma cases and 2,430 randomly selected cohort member controls from the "Agriculture Health Study", and will be based in Iowa and North Carolina.&nbsp; The LHS is introduced as a within scope modification No 0014 under contract HHSN291200555546C with Social and Scientific Systems, Inc. The aims of the study are to examine the relationship between pesticide and farm exposure and the development and severity of asthma, allergens, and genetic susceptibility to asthma.&nbsp; Asthma is a major public health problem and its complications can be severe.&nbsp; Farmers have high rates of morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; Farmers early life exposures to endotoxins may change their later response to farm exposure asthma triggers.&nbsp; This study will help to understand the interactions between pesticides and asthma in farmers.&nbsp; <br /><br />The original contract was competed as a small business set-aside.&nbsp; A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract was appropriate because the uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient confidence to permit the use of any type of fixed price contract (FAR 16.302-1).

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to proclaim that the Work Assignment Amendment is to obligate a total of $123,497 in Recovery funding to perform this requirement at the site. for preparation of a work plan that shall outline, describe and include the technical approach, resources, timeline and due dates for deliverables, and a detailed cost estimate by task and a staffing plan. The general requirement of this work is to review previous work performed at this site and excavate, transport and dispose of petroleum contaminated soil above Tier I cleanup levels. The site is located on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation in Fort Thompson, South Dakota.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO AN EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDER. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>NOAA's investment in IDL as a NOAA standard is significant, and IDL operations support the core of NOAA's mission to deliver satellite data processing, weather forecasts, climate predictions. &nbsp;For NOAA's 6000 sites that requiring mathematical modeling and visualization software, nearly all the source code is written in the IDL language. &nbsp;Workstations, servers, and super-computer are extensively processing IDL programs. &nbsp;If NOAA were to try to change to operations using other software the disruption to current operations would be immediately catastrophic, services to end users halted, cost would be both prohibitive and not funded, conversion would take at least 5 years, and benefits none. &nbsp;One third of NOAA's workforce is directly tied to using IDL. &nbsp;All of the nation depends on their output to understand weather and environment. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Previous maintenance contracts for IDL expired and NOAA seeks to renew the IDL contract for another 5 years. &nbsp;The current investment in IDL is so considerable, that the justification for IDL is not only because the cost of the recommended NOAA enterprise site license for IDL is the lowest cost to the government for the software alone. &nbsp;NOAA's investment in its human resources (the skillset of its scientific community), the computing infrastructure (computer hardware and networks), and shared software libraries and system interfaces, which are all heavily invested in IDL, prohibit any ability to change just based on weighing the renewal of a maintenance contract. &nbsp;The effort to change would require a long-term plan and budget to move NOAA to another technical architecture, and neither intention, plan, nor budget exist amongst any of the NOAA Line Offices using IDL. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ''times new roman''; mso-fareast-font-family: ''times new roman''; mso-bidi-font-family: ''times new roman''">The Sole Source Justifications and Requirements for using IDL is: &nbsp;there is only one single source, distributor and seller of IDL. &nbsp;That source is the owner and&nbsp;manufacturer.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ''times new roman''; mso-fareast-font-family: ''times new roman''; mso-bidi-font-family: ''times new roman''">If IDL operations were interrupted there would be immediate&nbsp;Unusual and Compelling Urgencies. &nbsp;Without continuity of IDL, there will be&nbsp;operational emergencies in NOAA - OAR, NESDIS, and NWS. &nbsp;At risk is the ability to continue NOAA's mission to provide the public the&nbsp;weather and climate forecasting&nbsp;products from NOAA, on which the nation depends.</span><span> </span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span>NOAA scientists use IDL to support the NOAA mission. &nbsp;IDL is used to analyze, mathematically manipulate and visually display satellite algorithm results, and satellite data. It is used in stellite remote sensing, with the ability to read raw satellite data files, then process the data using IDL-libraries and NOAA-written IDL software procedures. IDL statistical analysis for publications and presentations, data imagery, file creation and general data manipulation of large satellite data sets. All satellite data processing is done in IDL. The tasks are spread across different servers and laptops. For example, IDL is used in the wind applications to ingest the satellite data, calibrate the data, map the earth, calculate winds, map the output, and produce display products and output files that are used by other NOAA systems. &nbsp; Similarly IDL is used to analyze wave data. &nbsp;These are one some of the projects that use IDL, this list being limited to NESDIS: </span></p>

<DESC>Upon the basis of the following justification for other than full and open competition, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action pursuant to the authority cited herein.1.	Contracting Activity	Department of Veterans Affairs	Office of Administration Procurement Section (033C1)	810 Vermont Avenue, NW	Washington, DC  204202.	Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for a Purchase Order, with LV COMM-SEC, 4007 Sanders Lane, Catharpin Virginia 20143 to continue work on the expansion of the Physical Access Control System (PACS).  Amount of award is $72,982.213.	Description of Services:  The contractor shall install the PACS System and provide maintenance for the security system at the EES Crystal City Office and Conference Center, Arlington VA 22202.4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority for this justification is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A),"(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for:(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition	5..         Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The is required to maintain the continuity of the PACS System. The contractor has installed and maintained all aspects of the current PACS System. The contractor is also responsible for the maintenance of the system which is covered by a service/maintenance contract which will cover future service/maintenance of the equipment to be installed. If any other vendor would be selected it would void the warranty from the manufacture as LV COMM-SEC is the only vendor trained and authorized by the manufacture to provide this installation and maintenance in the DC Metro Area..   6.	Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources:  This is a follow on contract for services already being provided by LVCOMSEC to VHA. The follow on will ensure system continuity within the PACS System used by VHA. The PO# for the installation that this is a follow on to is 101-J05088 and the maintenance PO establish that service on this equipment will fall under is 101-J05089.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost:  The labor costs associated with this Order was competitively negotiated by the Contracting Office prior to award of the original contract. This was done using the competitive process. 8.	Market Survey:  No market was done as this is a follow on contract and in order to fall under the existing VHA maintenance contact we have to use this vendor.9.	Additional Support for Other than Full and Open Competition:  LVCOMSEC is performing satisfactorily and no formal complaints or discrepancies have been filed with the Contracting Officer.  They are thoroughly familiar with the systems and requirements of the current contract and are the only contractor authorized to work on the system in place. Full competition will not result in cost savings or higher quality service for VA due to the short timeframe provided for a new contract award prior to the expiration of current Task Order agreement.  Award to any other source would most likely result in substantial increase of cost.  This requirement is time sensitive and must be responded to thoroughly and expeditiously in meeting the Department's needs.10.	Other Interested Sources:  Not available as this is the only vendor authorized provide this services without voiding the warranty. 11.	Future Competitive Plans:  We do not anticipate competing this contract for the next two years due to the unique capabilities of the personnel assigned and the need to maintain consistency for our telecommunications support activities.TECHNICAL AND REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATIONREQUIRED BY FAR 6.303-1I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification forms a basis for this justification are complete and accurate, and meet the minimum needs and scheduled requirements.Technical/Requirements Cognizance_____________________________				_______3/25/10_________________									DateCONTRACTING OFFICE CERTIFICATIONI hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.______________________________				______3/25/10 ___________George T Curtner							     DateContracting Officer
