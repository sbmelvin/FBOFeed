<CONTACT>Florence P Black, Email fpblack@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) / National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/ Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) in Pittsburgh, PA, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price Purchase Order to Rohmac, Inc., of Mount Storm, WV. The contractor will provide eleven (11) full-scale mockup longwall roof supports to be used as test fixtures in the full-scale simulated longwall laboratory at OMSHR's Pittsburgh facility as a part of the NIOSH-OMSHR research project entitled, "Controlling Respirable Dust in Coal Mining Operations".
<p>In order to correctly function and simulate the underground mining environment, the roof supports contemplated in this procurement action must be compatible with the existing full-scale mockup longwall shearing machine and other full-scale mockup longwall roof supports previously manufactured by Rohmac Inc. As the roof supports and shearing machine must interface closely when simulating longwall mining activities and movements, in order to ensure compatibility, avoid issues with physical interference, and maintain safe operation, these items must be manufactured to consistent specifications. These new roof supports must be manufactured to the same exact dimensions as the existing roof supports to provide a consistent testing domain and a consistent basis for future adjustments and movements. As small changes in shape and size can result in large variations in air flow patterns and the resulting airborne dust dispersion along the longwall face, even small changes in the provided roof supports could hinder work in designing appropriate dust control measures. In the event that incompatible roof supports of differing forms are provided, existing research efforts may be delayed and future work would be potentially limited in fulfilling the broad range of testing required. Because of their unique and proprietary design, only Rohmac Inc. can ensure that the supplied roof supports will be 100% compatible with the existing installation.</p>
<p>This Procurement is for Commercial Items as defined by FAR Parts 2 &amp; 12.</p>
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within 15 business days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any quotation/response must be emailed to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov before 11:00 AM on December 18, 2014.</p>

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 2590-01-569-3285- Bracket, Vehicular Component, bought in accordance with AM General (34623) part number 6039447. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. The required quantity is 7,224 units with no option shipping (W62G2T) DLA Distribution Tracy, CA 95376-5000. This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at destination are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 12/19/14. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 150 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil.

<p>Manufacturer's Code and Part Number:<br />Industrial Gas Springs, Inc. (6CSH4), P/N GS-3039-2</p>
<p>Unit of Issue: EA</p>
<p>Quantity: 780</p>
<p>Various Increments Solicited: 1-780, 781-850, 851-950, 951-1050</p>
<p>Destination Information: FOB Origin, Inspection and Acceptance at Destination</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 183 days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The solicitation (RFP) will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 12/21/14 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/. Solicitation number is SPE7MC15R0031.</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. <br />TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management (OAAM), on behalf of the Biomolecular Measurement Division (BMD) within the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Bioinformatics Solutions Inc. of Ontario, Canada under the authority of 41 USA 253(c)(1) - only one responsible source for PEAKS Studio Desktop7 mass spectra analysis software, software training, and software maintenance for a base period of one year up to four one-year option periods.<br /><br />The BMD is responsible for the development of peptide tandem mass spectral libraries. These libraries are constructed by searching hundreds of millions of mass spectra against theoretical fragmentation patterns derived from protein sequences. The theoretical matches are then refined to produce high-quality reference spectra for on-line distribution. NIST has successfully used multiple technologies for the evaluation of protein mass spectra including software systems developed at NIST and publicly available software platforms such as Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA), Mascot Search Engine, and MS-GF+. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Basis for Sole Source:</span></strong><br />The aforementioned PEAKS software examines mass spectral data to identify sequence tags, finding mass values corresponding to amino acids or post-translationally modified amino acids. This capability is unique to PEAKS Studio Dekstop7 and is not available from other software products. This capability is necessary for NIST to distinguish spectra derived from proteins.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210 - Software Publishers. The small business size standard is $38.5M.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 17, 2014 will be considered by the Government.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

A proper invoice is an "Original" which must include the items listed in subdivisions 1 through 12, below, in addition to the requirements of FAR 32.9. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the Contractor will be notified of the defect within 7 days after the date the designated billing office received the invoice (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish, and 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils) with a statement of the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. (See exceptions under II., below.) Untimely notification will be taken into account in the computation of any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</p>
<p>1. Vendor/Contractor: Name, Address, Point of Contact for the invoice (Name, title, telephone number, e-mail and mailing address of point of contact). <br />2. Remit-to address (Name and complete mailing address to send payment). <br />3. Remittance name must match exactly with name on original order/contract. If the Remittance name differs from the Legal Business Name, then both names must appear on the invoice. <br />4. Invoice date. <br />5. Unique invoice #s for all invoices per vendor regardless of site. <br />6. NBS document number formats must be included for awards created in the NBS: Contract Number; Purchase Order Number; Task or Delivery Order Number and Source Award Number (e.g., Indefinite Delivery Contract number; General Services Administration number); or, BPA Call Number and BPA Parent Award Number. <br />7. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) or DUNS + 4 as registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). <br />8. Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

The VIN is the number that appears after the contractor's name on the face page of the award document. <br />9. Identify that payment is to be made using a three-way match. <br />10. Description of supplies/services that match the description on the award, by line billed.* <br />11. Freight or delivery charge must be billed as shown on the award. If it is included in the item price do not bill it separately. If identified in the award as a separate line item, it must be billed separately. <br />12. Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price, Extended Price of supplies delivered or services performed, as applicable, and that match the line items specified in the award.*</p>
<p>* NOTE: If your invoice must differ from the line items on the award, please contact the Contracting Officer before submitting the invoice. A modification to the order or contract may be needed before the invoice can be submitted and paid.</p>
<p>B. Shipping costs will be reimbursed only if authorized by the Contract/Purchase Order. If authorized, shipping costs must be itemized. Where shipping costs exceed $100, the invoice must be supported by a bill of lading or a paid carrier's receipt.</p>
<p><br />C. Mail an original copy of the itemized invoice to:</p>
<p>National Institutes of Health <br />Office of Financial Management, <br />Commercial Accounts <br />2115 East Jefferson Street, Room 4B-432, <br />MSC 8500 <br />Bethesda, MD 20892-8500</p>
<p>For inquiries regarding payment call: (301) 496-6088</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the prompt payment of invoices, it is recommended that the vendor submit a photocopy of the invoice to the "Consignee" designated for the acquisition in blocks 6A - 6E of the face page of the Order/Award document.</p>
<p>II. Invoice Payment</p>
<p>A. Except as indicated in paragraph B., below, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events:</p>
<p>1. The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice. <br />2. The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed.</p>
<p>B. The due date for making invoice payments for meat and meat food products, perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, and edible fats or oils, shall be in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act, as amended.</p>
<p>III. Interest Penalties</p>
<p>A. An interest penalty shall be paid automatically, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed below are met, if applicable.</p>
<p>1. A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office. <br />2. A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with an term or condition. <br />3. In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>B. Determination of interest and penalties due will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, the Contract Disputes Act, and regulations issued by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>IV. PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS, 52.232-99 (DEVIATION) (August 2013)</p>
<p>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012, and the extension to that policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-13-15, Extension of Policy to Provide Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2013.</p>

Include the substance of this article, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns. <br />c.

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice Information
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) founded the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) in 2009 to conduct basic and applied research relevant to malaria immunology and vaccine development, to pursue novel vaccine concepts, to produce prototype malaria vaccines, and to conduct early-phase clinical trials of promising vaccine candidates. The overarching goal is to develop malaria vaccines that will reduce severe disease and death among African children and pregnant women and will eliminate malaria from low-transmission areas of the world.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>NIAID intends to solicit proposals for contracts entitled Operation of a Facility Testing Malaria Vaccines in Adult Human Subjects to advance development of candidate malaria vaccines in order to reduce the number of malaria cases worldwide. The LMIV requires clinical trials to investigate initial safety, immunogenicity, and biologic impact of promising vaccine candidates. Clinical trials may also be conducted as part of pathogenesis research to facilitate vaccine development. These may include a Phase 1 Malaria Vaccine Trial, Phase 1-2 Challenge Trials, and Experimental Infection Trials.</p>
<p>Draft clinical protocols will be provided by LMIV investigators. LMIV will develop protocol objectives and overall design. The Contractor will then assist in completing the final draft protocol. Upon LMIV review of the final draft, the Contractor will be responsible for submitting each protocol to the Contractor's Institutional Review Board (IRB) and obtaining approval. This effort shall be coordinated with LMIV staff for parallel approval by the NIAID IRB. The Contractor shall provide all final IRB documents to LMIV. Where investigational applications are required, approved protocols will be filed with the Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by NIAID as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application.</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated on the ability to conduct Phase 1 Malaria Vaccine Trial, Phase 1-2 Challenge Trials, and Experimental Infection Trials. The ability of offerors to ensure delivery of fresh specimens according to protocol requirements (human PBMCs) to LMIV in Rockville, MD within two hours of initial processing and to deliver cryopreserved PBMCs to LMIV by 4:00pm EST on the next business day after the COR's request will also be evaluated. Evaluation of the proposals will be based on the following technical evaluation criteria: (1) Technical Plan/Approach, (2) Scientific and Technical Personnel, and (3) Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources.</p>
<p>NIAID expects to issue task orders for clinical trials of LMIV's promising vaccine candidates under approximately 5 Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts. These IDIQ contracts are expected to be awarded in June of 2015 for a period of 5 years.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 18, 2014 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract or Task Order. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals to be submitted via two methods: (1)<br />Disc (CD or DVD) and (2) Online via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website. The content of the disc and online proposals must be identical. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable.</p>

<DESC><br />Outreach Partnership Program<br />Pre-Solicitation Notice - HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-RFP-15-34
<p>Title:<br />National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Outreach Partnership Program</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>
<p>Introduction: <br />This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice of Intent. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. A solicitation will be issued on a later date.<br /><br />The purpose of this pre-solicitation is to notify potential offerors that the NIMH intends to solicit proposals for their Outreach Partnership Program from qualified contractors having the capability to perform the tasks identified in this pre-solicitation. <br />Requirement Background Information:</p>
<p>NIMH, one of 27 institutes and centers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the lead Federal agency for research on mental disorders. NIH is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIMH envisions a world in which mental illnesses are prevented and cured. The mission of NIMH is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. This public health mandate demands that the Institute harness powerful scientific tools to achieve better understanding, treatment, and eventually, prevention of these disabling conditions that affect millions of Americans.<br /><br />The Outreach Partnership Program supports 55 Outreach Partners: one (1) in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The states of California, New York, and Texas each have two (2) Outreach Partners. The Program works to increase the public's access to science-based mental health information through partnerships with state organizations.<br /><br />Purpose and Objectives for the Requirement:<br />The purpose of this anticipated procurement is to establish a contract with a company/ organization or companies/organizations that have specialized experience in mental health outreach and education to disseminate NIMH research and resources, and promote research participation.</p>
<p>Project Tasks/Requirements:</p>
<p>NIMH requires outreach support services for the following three (3) task areas:</p>
<p>Task 1:	Program Management</p>
<p>Staffing: Outreach Partner organizations must have a designated person who will be responsible for the management of the organization's participation in the Program, including accomplishing the tasks, ensuring that all education and outreach efforts are based on current science, and preparing contract deliverables. This person serves as the primary point of contact for NIMH. This individual should have experience in mental health education and outreach, and will be involved in the organization's day-to-day NIMH Outreach Partner activities. Outreach Partner organizations also must have a designated backup contact person, preferably with mental health outreach and education experience.</p>
<p>Monitoring and Reporting: Outreach Partner organizations are required to submit online progress reports (3 times a year), and an end-of-year narrative report. The online progress reports collect data and information about Program-related activities such as: <br />&bull;	Types of NIMH materials (e.g., publications) and information (e.g., Science News) disseminated;<br />&bull;	Methods and channels (e.g., listserv, social media, newsletter, website, traditional and online media, health fairs, exhibits, conferences, etc.) used to disseminate NIMH materials and information; <br />&bull;	Number of individuals who received these materials (e.g., number of listserv and newsletter subscribers, website visitors, conference attendees, etc.); and<br />&bull;	How NIMH information was incorporated into dissemination, outreach, and education activities, and/or materials (e.g., flyers, insertion in organization's newsletter, etc.) produced related to those activities.</p>
<p>Active Participation: Either the primary or the backup contact person must participate in the NIMH Outreach Partnership Program annual meeting, and also is asked to participate in Program-related educational opportunities offered by NIMH such as teleconferences and webinars.<br />&bull;	The Outreach Partnership Program annual meeting brings together researchers, Outreach Partners, the Program's National Partners, NIMH staff, and representatives from other federal government agencies. At this meeting, Outreach Partners learn about research advances related to the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders, and participate in partner sharing activities such as poster, breakout and plenary sessions. NIMH covers the costs for one (1) staff member from each Outreach Partner organization to attend the meeting. <br />Additionally, Outreach Partners are periodically asked to: <br />&bull;	Prepare a brief presentation about the organization's outreach activities and deliver it in the Program's annual meeting (i.e., breakouts, plenaries, and/ or sharing session) and in the Program's educational activities (i.e., teleconferences and webinars);<br />&bull;	Submit descriptive text and photos about the organization's outreach and education activities for inclusion in the Program's e-newsletter, Outreach Connection; and/or <br />&bull;	Participate in the Program's Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is an informal working group of 5-6 Outreach Partners which meets two (2) to three (3) times annually via teleconference, to provide input to Program staff about Program-related activities.</p>
<p>Link to NIMH Resources: Outreach Partners are required to post and maintain the links listed below on their organization's website:</p>
<p>&bull;	NIMH Clinical Trials webpage (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/trials); <br />&bull;	NIMH home page (http://www.nimh.nih.gov);<br />&bull;	NIMH Outreach Partnership Program webpage (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/outreach/partnership-program); and <br />&bull;	NIH Clinical Trials website (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).</p>
<p>Task 2:	Statewide Dissemination, Outreach, and Education</p>
<p>Outreach Partner organizations are required to disseminate NIMH research findings and educational materials statewide through mental health outreach and education to the general public and a variety of targeted audiences. For the states of California, Texas, and New York, where there are two (2) Outreach Partners, dissemination activities are specific to the region of the state they are serving for the Program. Outreach Partners are required to incorporate NIMH materials and research findings into these efforts. Additionally, Outreach Partners are expected to leverage their relationships with state, regional, and local networks (e.g., coalitions and committees), and government agencies to enhance the reach of statewide dissemination activities.</p>
<p>NIMH expects Outreach Partner organizations to use a variety of methods and channels on a regular basis to disseminate NIMH information and materials. Listed below are examples of methods and channels that Outreach Partner organizations may use in their statewide dissemination efforts: <br />&bull;	Member/partner/affiliate listservs;<br />&bull;	Conferences, meetings, trainings, and support groups;<br />&bull;	Community events such as health fairs, exhibit booths/tables, walks; <br />&bull;	Website and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter;<br />&bull;	Traditional and online media;<br />&bull;	Electronic and print newsletters/publications; and/or<br />&bull;	Presentations by researchers funded by NIMH.</p>

<DESC>Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) No. 14-23773, approved on 2 April 2014, authorized a sole source procurement with Logos Technologies LLC, for operations, sustainment, refurbishment, and maintenance of Kestrel Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) systems and sensors deployed on Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) and Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) aerostats in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM as requested by the U.S. Central Command's Joint Urgent Operational Need CC-0424. At time of award, the contract was fully funded by Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 Operations and Maintenance, Army (OMA) and FY14 Other Procurement, Army (OPA) funds totaling $39M. The contract's original period of performance was from date of award through 31 December 2014.&nbsp;A request from the U.S. Army Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors was received to extend Kestrel WAS operations and sustainment on the PGSS and PTDS aerostat systems through 31 March 2015 due to unforeseen theater requirements and the U.S. Army's internal acquisition challenges. Due to this request and subsequent NAWCAD approval,&nbsp;the period of performance is planned to be extended 90 days.

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, Acquisition Management Services, Program Support Center, 12501 Ardennes Avenue, Suite 400, Rockville, MD 20857</p>
<p><br />Description</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start, through the Program Support Center (PSC), has a requirement to procure twelve (12) Regional Training and Technical Assistance contracts that will provide local grantees with high-quality, sustained, and intensive training and technical assistance that, "to the maximum extent practicable," improves the capacity of local programs to deliver services that, at a minimum, meet or exceed the priority areas described in section 641 (A)(a)(1): correction of findings identified through the federal monitoring system; school readiness; and, training/professional development needs of staff.</p>
<p>The twelve ACF Regions include the following states and entities:</p>
<p>&bull; Region 1 - Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont <br />&bull; Region 2 - New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands<br />&bull; Region 3 - Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia <br />&bull; Region 4 - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee <br />&bull; Region 5 - Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin <br />&bull; Region 6 - Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas<br />&bull; Region 7 - Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska<br />&bull; Region 8 - Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming<br />&bull; Region 9 - Arizona, California, Nevada, and Hawaii/Outer Pacific (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau)<br />&bull; Region 10 - Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington<br />&bull; Region 11 -American Indian/Alaska Native grantees in 26 states across the country<br />&bull; Region 12 - Migrant and Seasonal grantees in 37 states across the country</p>
<p>Each ACF Region will include several Early Childhood (EC) Specialists, with the number of EC Specialists proportionate with the number of grantees and delegates within that region. The work of these specialists will be directed toward two of the three priority areas: school readiness and the training/career development needs of teaching staff.</p>
<p>The Early Childhood (EC) Specialist position requires a minimum of a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree. The degrees for at least 75% of the EC Specialists must be in Early Childhood Education/Development or related field. If the highest degree was awarded more than ten years ago, the resume should be specific regarding courses, conferences, seminars attended that ensure the specialist remains current in the field of early childhood education/development.</p>
<p>Individuals proposed as ECs who are infant toddler specialists must have a minimum of a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree, in Early Childhood Education/Development with coursework specific to infant and toddler development.</p>
<p>EC Specialists must have a minimum of 5 years' experience in programs for young children with a preference for experience spanning the birth to five continuum. This experience should include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers/home visitors and/or education managers in early childhood programs.</p>
<p>The experience of EC Specialists who are infant toddler specialists must include experience with programs serving infants and toddlers. This experience must include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers, home visitors, family child care providers, and/or education managers.</p>
<p>The experience should include experience related to supporting family engagement and/or family wellbeing.</p>
<p>Individuals proposed as birth to five specialists must have experience across the birth to five spectrum.<br /><br />All EC Specialists must obtain CLASS certification before providing TTA to grantees related to CLASS.</p>
<p>In addition, the government is seeking to secure the services of several Grantee Specialists for each region. These specialists will be deployed by the regional office to work on the third priority area: deficiencies identified through the monitoring system. In regions with few grantees with identified deficiencies, the grantee specialists may also be deployed to work with grantees with multiple areas of noncompliance, grantees with concerns raised through risk management meetings, or with grantees about which concerns have been raised though other data sources, such as the Program Information Report (PIR).</p>
<p>The Grantee Specialist position requires a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree. A minimum of 5 years of experience related to program design and management of fiscal operations in or with Head Start/Early Head Start programs and the development and implementation of comprehensive management systems.</p>
<p>In each region, there will be a TTA Coordinator who will work with federal personnel to coordinate the work of the various states and provide ongoing supervision of TTA staff. The TTA Coordinator will also be responsible for the implementation of quality assurance processes to ensure the appropriate provision of TTA and contract deliverables.</p>
<p>The TTA Coordinator position requires a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of 7 years' experience is required with 10 years preferred. This experience must include at least 3 years with the provision of high level technical assistance and consultation to Head Start programs; 3-5 years of progressive supervisory/management experience with a preference for experience managing remote-located staff/teams; and expertise and experience in budget oversight and management.</p>
<p>The place of performance for all contract staff, with the exception of the TTA Coordinator who will be located in the Regional Office, will be at a physical location within a state in the region for which the awarded contract is providing services. To provide economies of scale, the use of home offices is strongly encouraged. Virtual offices may not be substituted for a physical presence in the region.</p>
<p>Services may be provided off-site, on-site, through virtual media, or a combination thereof. Other places of performance include, but are not limited to, contractor physical locations, Head Start grantee facilities, hotel meeting rooms, ACF Regional Offices, at third-party sponsored conferences and other locations throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Twelve cost-reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for a 12 month base period and four 12 month option periods for a total of 60 months. Responses to the Request for Proposal package will be due within 60 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. Award of this requirement is anticipated by June 30, 2015. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government intends to conduct a FAR Part 15 acquisition.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award to AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in Redwood City, CA.  The Government is seeking to develop a fast-acting, easily dispensed, sufentanil-based, sublingual battlefield pain management product designed to relieve acute pain with minimal side-effects usually associated with the use of common analgesics currently in use.  The current lead candidate for an alternative Battlefield Pain Management product that is safe, fast-acting, and administered without the necessity of starting an intravenous or intraosseous infusion is the Sufentanil  Nanotab under development by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.  The US Army and the US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) Pharmaceutical Systems Project Management Office (PSPMO) have selected the Sufentanil  Nanotab program for clinical development to satisfy the capability for an alternative pain management product on the battlefield.  The Sufentanil  Nanotab Program is scheduled to begin a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of single and repeat dosing of the sufentanil microtablet.  AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the only source capable of rendering services required to initiate the Phase 3 clinical trial.  The Army has no knowledge of any additional efforts for development of a sufentanil-based battlefield pain management product, thus this procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.   <br>  <br>  <br> This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing.  Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above.  A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.  If no responses are received, within fifteen (15) days, 18 December 2014, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable supplies and services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this notice should be sent to toloria.s.duvall.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION / SOURCES SOUGHT <br>  <br> This is a sources sought synopsis and is solely for informational, market research and planning purposes only.  This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) or a request to submit prices.  Only contractors capable of performing this type of work should respond. <br>  <br> 1.  The 409th Contracting Support Brigade in Kaiserslautern, Germany, is considering establishing a pre-priced BPA(s) for the supplies or services described below: <br>  <br> Emergency and between-occupancy facilities maintenance for the buildings that comprise the controlled monitoring area (CMA) on the U.S. Army installation in Baumholder.  <br>  <br> Snow and ice control for the streets that comprise the controlled monitoring area (CMA) on the U.S. Army installation in Baumholder.  <br>  <br> 2.  Understanding a BPA:  A BPA is not a contract, but a simplified method of satisfying anticipated repetitive requirements for supplies or services by establishing  quote mark charge accounts quote mark  with qualified vendors.  BPAs are designed to reduce the administrative costs associated with small purchases by eliminating the need to issue individual purchase documents.  The Government and the vendor agree in advance to all of the terms and conditions applicable to individual purchases made under a BPA.  The Government is only obligated to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the BPA and there is no minimum monetary amount the Government is obligated to purchase. <br>    <br> 3.  BPA Pricing:  A BPA may be pre-priced or prices for covered supplies or services may be negotiated between the Government and the vendor at the time orders are placed.  For pre-priced BPAs, the vendor submits a signed itemized price list for the covered services to the Contracting Officer (CO) for approval.  The period during which prices are effective must be stated on the face/cover of the price list.  The CO reviews the price list to determine which supplies or services qualify to be included in the BPA and if prices for qualifying items are fair and reasonable.  The CO may approve none, some or all of the items in the price list.  At any time during the life of the BPA, the vendor may submit revised prices subject to the approval of the CO.   <br>  <br> 4.  Period of Agreement:  The BPA may be written for a period of up to 18 months.    <br>  <br> 5.  The following attachments (if checked) are provided for your review and to further assist you in understanding the BPA being considered. <br>  <br> _X__  a. Map of the CMA, _1_ Pages  <br> _X__  b. Memo regarding PPE, _1_ Pages  <br>  X _  c. Sample Price List, _1_ Pages <br>  <br> 6.  If after reviewing this letter and the attached documents you are interested in entering into a BPA for services described therein, contact Margaret Maine by email at margaret.c.maine@mail.mil.  DEADLINE FOR RESPONSES IS 14:00, 10 DECEMBER 2014. <br>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying Legacy Archive Tape Management Services as listed below:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The USDA Forest Service (FS) is interested in acquiring a service that effectively allows the agency to manage legacy IT information currently residing on archive tapes and stored in multiple third party facilities. It is estimated that the FS has on the order of 100,000+ tapes containing raw, non-deduplicated data, currently housed offsite in these commercial archive centers and other locations. Much of the data on these tapes were archived by the FS using IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (version 5.3) as well as other means. The commercial archive facilities are geographically located in 10 different major city locations around CONUS. Data on these tapes are being held primarily to comply with retention policies and open legal hold orders. Periodically, there is a need to retrieve specific, often narrowly scoped, information that exists only on these tapes. Lotus Notes email is most commonly retrieved. For example, to satisfy Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or legal discovery orders received by the agency. While agency disposition plans for legacy content have been suspended for some time, it is expected that these will resume in the foreseeable future. The FS will need to implement tape destruction practices that meet federal storage media destruction guidelines at that time.</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>The new archive service must resolve several problems the FS is experiencing with its current process. Today the FS relies on maintaining a legacy infrastructure of hardware and software to enable the restoration of content on archive tapes. This legacy infrastructure is not upgradeable and vendor support has gone end-of-life. The outcome of this situation continues to be an unreliable system and an ineffective process for recovering specific information in a timely manner to meet deadlines. The broad geographical distribution of these storage media in multiple facilities no longer serves a purpose and is adding both cost, time, and risk when tapes must be handled and shipped to the legacy system for restoration. In addition, having this storage media dispersed across these locations adds significant complexity to our business and operational management processes involving these facilities. In most cases, our need to acquire and restore legacy information is driven by regulatory or litigation orders, such as FOIA or legal eDiscovery requests. The current process cannot meet the typical delivery time constraints put on such requests. In addition, there remains a significant quantity of legacy content (primarily tapes) not currently held in the commercial facilities mentioned, and need to be relocated. Legal holds involving the agency may require continued preservation of these tapes into the foreseeable future. However, the likelihood of needing to restore and collect information from these sources is very low.</p>
<p>Desired Outcome:</p>
<p>The service sought by the FS would enable an efficient and value added process for storing, retrieving, deleting/destruction, and generally managing the lifecycle of legacy information currently on tape, or other portable, storage media. The service must eliminate the agency's need to maintain legacy IT infrastructure to restore information. The service should also result in shorter delivery times from initial request to receiving the readable, native/original format data from the provider. The ability to cull (eg. search and filter) information prior to delivery is highly desirable to limit FS data ingestion to that which is relevant to the requesting project. Easy management and use of the service, through a simplified account structure and web accessible customer interfaces, is also important. The service must also be scalable to accommodate data volume expansions, or contractions, throughout the life of the service. The service should also provide tiered storage options to accommodate varying data value and access needs for low priority storage media as a means to minimize costs. In summary, the FS is seeking a service that greatly increases our ability to access and manage legacy information while reducing the overall time and cost associated with handling the storage media.</p>
<p>RESPONSES:</p>
<p>Responses are to include the following:<br />a) Name of corporate point of contact, telephone number, full mailing address, e-mail address, CAGE Code, NAICS identifier and any other pertinent information.<br />b) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to providing Legacy Archive Tape Management Services.<br />c) Whether your company's interest in the Legacy Archive Tape Management Services a prime contractor, a subcontractor, or other as specified.<br />d) Describe any key considerations in when considering Legacy Archive Tape Management Services.<br />e) Companies should present their responses in the form of a whitepaper no more than 25 pages in length describing the information requested in this RFI. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the whitepaper. <br />f) Responses shall be in Microsoft WORD <br />g) The format of your response shall be as follows:<br />1. Font size of Times New Roman 12 or a font of similar size and clarity.<br />2. 8.5 X 11 paper with 1 inch margins on all sides.<br />3. While there is no page limit, overly verbose qualification statements are strongly discouraged.<br />h) Companies should submit their response no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on 02/02/11.<br />i) Companies will submit their responses electronically to mdesouto@fs.fed.us, E-mail file sizes shall not exceed 6Mbs.<br />j) Technical questions may be directed to Kevin Hadley khadley@fs.fed.us 406.791.7747 and shall include the Contracting Officer Michael DeSouto mdesouto@fs.fed.us in the Cc block on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing silane vapor deposition tool for PDMS-based soft lithography application to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The tools will be sited and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the CNST NanoFab. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the tools that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>A silane vapor deposition tool is a stand-alone tool that is capable of depositing monolayer of silane based chemicals on the surface of the PDMS master to prevent PDMS from adhering to the master. Silanization is a critical step for soft lithography fabrication, especially when fabricating thin film PDMS devices with micro and/or nanometer features on the master. CNST is in the process of establishing a user based soft lithography laboratory that requires a silane vapor deposition tool. In order to increase NIST's capability to serve users and provide improved process performance and productivity for nanofabrication, NIST has a need for one silane vapor deposition tool. The tool shall meet the specifications described below.</p>
<p>1. General<br />The silane vapor deposition tool is intended to be used by researchers to deposit monolayer of silane based chemicals on the surface of the PDSM master without exposing the researcher to the chemicals during the process.</p>
<p>2. Tool configuration<br />a. Each tool shall be a stand-alone desktop system and include the following components:<br />(1) A process chamber that is exhausted;<br />(2) A process chamber with substrate holder;<br />(3) A programmable process controller and associated process control hardware and software. <br />b. The tool should have multiple chemical reservoirs and chemical vapor lines for different chemical delivery.<br />c. The tool shall be facilitated with the chemical delivery system within the footprint.<br />d. The tool shall provide safety feature to alarm users and shutdown process in case of any chemical leaks.<br />e. The process chamber shall always be under vacuum when not in use.</p>
<p>3. Wafer compatibility and wafer heating<br />a. The tool shall be able to process substrates with various sizes including 75 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm round and square substrate, and substrate pieces with irregular shapes that is smaller than 150mm.<br />b. The tool shall be able to process silicon, silicon dioxide, quartz, fused silica, GaAs, metals and ceramics.<br />c. The tool shall be able to heat substrate to minimum 120&deg;C.</p>
<p>4. Chemical compatibility and delivery<br />a. The tool should be able to perform vapor deposition using following chemicals: <br />i. Fluorosilane;<br />ii. Chlorotrimethylsiloxane;<br />iii. Trichloromethylsiloxane;<br />iv. (Tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)trichlorosilane. <br />b. The tool shall be able to deliver the chemical solution to the process chamber as specified in a process recipe under microprocessor control. <br />c. The tool shall be able to control substrate exposure to chemical by programming minimum volume delivery and exposure time.<br />d. The tool is desired to be able to perform chamber cleaning between runs to prevent cross contamination between different chemicals.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture silane vapor deposition tools are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(s) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice: Seeking Sources for X-ray Imaging Systems for Security Screening of Vehicles and Cargo Containers for Inclusion in Comparative Evaluation<br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is seeking Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and near COTS X-ray Imaging Systems capable of screening wheeled vehicles and cargo containers for the detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), IED components, and other threat items. A priority is placed on systems possessing material discrimination capabilities via dual energy x-ray sources or other methods.<br />The purpose of this sources sought notice (SSN) is to learn about x-ray imaging systems for security x-ray screening of vehicles and cargo containers. The SSN solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance.<br />BACKGROUND: NSWC IHEODTD plans to select systems for inclusion in a comparative field test and evaluation to take place in the continental United States (CONUS). Ideally, these systems will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to effectively and reliably find IEDs, IED components and other threat items while inspecting or pre-screening vehicles for authorized entrance at military installations.<br />Operational testing will be completed in a field environment. Test items imaged will consist of: test fixtures enabling the measurements of baseline capabilities (e.g. resolution, penetration, and material discrimination) and representative IEDs, IED components and other threat items. Systems will be evaluated according, but not limited, to the following performance parameters:<br />&bull; Image Resolution<br />&bull; Material Discrimination<br />&bull; Penetration Depth<br />&bull; Successful Threat Detection<br />&bull; Field of View<br />A final report of findings from the test and evaluation will be published and will provide comparisons and recommendations as to the limitations, capabilities and utility of the systems with a focus on the utility that material discrimination capabilities provide. This report will only be made available to Department of Defense (DoD), federal agencies and other law enforcement agencies as needed for official use.<br />This announcement serves to survey product availability. This announcement is NOT a formal solicitation, and is NOT an RFP. No direct contract awards will be made based on the outcome of the evaluation. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Our intent is to test technologically mature and market-ready equipment. <br />Interested entities are encouraged to respond by providing their company name, points of contact, a technical description of five or fewer pages and one Quad Chart for each model (only one version per model) of their proposed X-ray imaging system.<br />Technical information may be obtained from Stephen Cockey at 301-744-5161 or stephen.cockey@navy.mil. <br />Each submission shall be transmitted electronically to: robyn.moore@navy.mil and a copy to stephen.cockey@navy.mil.<br />

</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">The United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&amp;C) issues this initial RFI, in a planned series of RFIs, to collect information for planning purposes only regarding the concept of an Enterprise Automated Security Environment (EASE).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EASE is a concept; it is not an entity, system, or program. The EASE concept envisions an environment in which automated and dynamic enterprise-level cyberspace<sup>1</sup> defense capabilities&mdash;such as adaptive sensing, sense-making, decision-making, and acting&mdash;provide shared situational awareness and support response in cyber-relevant time<sup>2 </sup>.&nbsp; EASE itself is not a capability, but the concept aims to enable the government to improve its own cyberspace defense capabilities, benefiting from the enhanced interoperability and automation that EASE should create. In addition, other enterprises may voluntarily leverage this concept to augment their own cyberspace defense capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Making the EASE concept a reality will require the concerted, collaborative efforts of government, private sector, industry, academia, and other stakeholders, such as critical infrastructure<sup>3</sup> and key resources (CIKR) end users. This RFI represents just the first step in this direction.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Stryker Hip Retractor System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard is for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Howmedica Osteonics Corp. (DBA Stryker Orthopaedics), 325 Corporate Drive, Mahwah, NJ, 07430-2002. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 10:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Thursday, 4 Dec 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The part numbers, descriptions, and quantities required are as follows:<br />-1120-1000, Slotted Mallet, QTY 2<br />-1440-0010, Small Incision Retractor Tray, QTY 2<br />-1440-1010, Femoral Head Retractor Tray, QTY 2<br />-1440-1020, Retractor Impactor, QTY 2<br />-1440-1105S, Left Acetabular Retractor, QTY 2<br />-1440-1110S, Right Acetabular Retractor, QTY 2<br />-1440-1120, Femoral Elevator, QTY 2<br />-1440-1130S, Narrow Hohmann Retractor, QTY 4<br />-1440-1135S, Wide Hohmann Retractor, QTY 2<br />-1440-1140, Blunt Narrow Cobra Retractor, QTY 4<br />-1440-0001, Single High Case, QTY 2</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Stryker Hip Retractor System allows optimal retraction thus reducing the number of staff required in the Operating Room. The Orthopedic surgeon has trained using these Stryker hip retractor systems, and if these items are not purchased, the items would need to be rented at a substantial duplication of cost of approximately $30,000.00.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Laura.Caravantes@us.af.mil no later than 10:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Thursday, 4 Dec 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>

If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services. This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides the Government's intent to award a sole source modification to increase the ceiling of the CPFF labor CLIN 4002 under task order GST0010AJ0044. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This task order was originally competed (under the COMMITS NG GWAC) and awarded to Catapult Technology Ltd, 11 Canal Center Plaza, Floor 2, Alexandria, VA 22314 on March 23, 2010. The task order is scheduled to end on March 23, 2015 and has a current ceiling value of $66,752,000. As stated in a previous sole source synopsis posted on FedBizOps on October 6, 2014, the Government also intends to extend the period of performance of the task order for a period of 6 months under a separate modification. The current proposed modification will increase CPFF labor CLIN 4002, for Tasks 3 - 5. These tasks are: System Development and Maintenance Support, IT and Communications Response Readiness and Field Operations Support, and IT/Communications Equipment Management. The proposed modification will also decrease CLIN 4003, Tools, Not to Exceed, by approximately $100,000. The total value of the Task Order will remain unchanged. This sole source action is necessary to allow for uninterrupted OFDA support to handle current international disasters, such as for the Ebola crisis, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>that could not have been anticipated by the Government and Catapult at time of original award. This task order supports the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance's (DCHA) Office of Foreign Disaster and Assistance (OFDA), and requires end-to-end Information and Communications Technology (ICT) support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The task order requires the Contractor to plan, staff, and implement all of OFDA's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) support requirements, both for OFDA's operations at headquarters and in the field, to respond to natural or man-made disasters around the world. The proposed modifications are for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Catapult is the only contractor who can ensure continuity of services to ensure Government response to current and unknown disasters at this time. This sole source action is necessary to allow for uninterrupted OFDA support to handle current international disasters while the competitive follow-on acquisition under the GSA Alliant GWAC is being solicited and awarded. The competitive follow-on Alliant GWAC task order is anticipated to be awarded by February 2015, with a 90 day transition time frame. At this time, OFDA requires a contractor who will be able to provide immediate support, without experiencing reduced quality of performance during a learning curve period. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this sole source modification requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government as to whether or not to compete this proposed modification action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any questions/responses regarding this sole source action shall be directed to the GSA FEDSIM Contracting Officer, Victor Angkico, via email, at <a href="mailto:victor.angkico@gsa.gov">victor.angkico@gsa.gov</a>, and the FEDSIM Contract Specialist, Millicent Hawkins, at <a href="mailto:millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov">millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov</a>, no later than 17 December 2014.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The final Justification &amp; Approval supporting this sole source action will publically be made available as required after contract modification award.

<SUBJECT>License Opportunity for Artificial Recharge System
<SOLNBR>G15PS00071
<CONTACT>Benjamin Henry, Technology Enterprise Specialist, Email bhenry@usgs.gov
<DESC>US Geological Survey in Reston, VA, is soliciting inquiries from companies interested in licensing rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued as exclusive or nonexclusive, and may include specific fields of use. USGS is not providing any funding in conjunction with the potential license. Technology title, "Artificial Recharge System," US patent application 13/562,891.
<p>Background. The present invention relates to a system and method of artificially recharging groundwater reservoirs. Artificial recharge of ground water reservoirs has been used to augment water supplies and to improve water quality of some aquifers. For example, severe dewatering of the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer in Arkansas has occurred over the last 50 years, resulting in falling water table levels over large areas and decreased water yields to existing wells. Thus, there is a need to recharge the aquifer more efficiently than what occurs naturally. Because of the large amount of water removed from the alluvial aquifer, a substantial storage reservoir exists, which, if used effectively, could be an effective alternative to above-ground reservoir storage.</p>
<p>Abstract. The present invention is directed to an artificial recharge system and method for recharging an aquifer. The artificial recharge system includes a constructed wetland, a settling pond, and a porous recharge reservoir. The constructed wetland receives water from a surface water source and has aquatic vegetation used to remove sediments and chemicals from the water. The settling pond receives the water from the constructed wetland and provides additional sediment removal. The porous recharge reservoir, which is hydraulically connected to the aquifer, receives the water from the settling pond. The water flows by gravity from the porous recharge reservoir to the aquifer. A back-flush tube installed within a sand layer in the porous recharge reservoir is used to remove sediment and particulates from the sand layer.</p>
<p>Opportunity. Recharging techniques have been used over the past century, with previous attempts to recharge aquifers being costly and ineffective due to several variables. Water utility and preservation continue to threaten global economic and environmental stability. It is imperative to induce water recharging. The method described is an improvement over previous designs. It provides a low cost, low energy system with minimal moving parts while removing the requirement for chemical treatment of the recharge of water. Further, this recharging method is less expensive and invasive than traditional surface methods consisting of diversions and dams.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to bhenry@usgs.gov with the title of this technology in the subject line. Include your preferred contact information and the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about other USGS technologies available for licensing, please visit http://www.usgs.gov/tech-transfer/available_patents.html</p>
<p>These responses are provided to members of USGS's Office of Policy &amp; Analysis for the purpose of promoting public awareness of USGS owned technologies and conducting market research to determine commercial interest. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, USGS will follow the required formal licensing process. No follow-on procurement is expected to result from the responses to this notice.</p>

<SUBJECT>License Opportunity for Safe, Directional, Drought-Resistant Dug Well
<SOLNBR>G15PS00073
<CONTACT>Benjamin Henry, Technology Enterprise Specialist, Email bhenry@usgs.gov
<DESC>US Geological Survey in Reston, VA, is soliciting inquiries from companies interested in collaborating to further develop or licensing rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued as exclusive or nonexclusive, and may include specific fields of use. USGS is not providing any funding in conjunction with the potential license. Technology title, "Safe, Directional, Drought-resistant Dug Well," US patent application 14/488,097. <br /><br /><br />Opportunity. In northern New England, water from private wells often contains naturally occurring contaminants, such as arsenic, at concentrations that exceed the USEPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water. Residents who use drilled bedrock wells may find that they require expensive treatment to reduce exposure to arsenic; however, many people do not treat, treat incorrectly, or do not maintain their treatment systems. The shallow glacial aquifer can provide a safe alternate water source, but, traditionally designed dug wells, constructed in these sediments frequently have low yields and are susceptible to bacterial contamination. A newly designed shallow well has the potential to provide water without high arsenic while also providing high yields and protection from bacterial contamination. The new USGS well design uses a trench filled with crushed stone, constructed in glacial sediment, in which a 6-inch diameter (potable-water grade PVC) well casing with horizontal collectors is installed. The constructed aquifer is capped by an impermeable geotextile fabric and is covered with low-permeability materials to prevent bacterial contamination. The large volume of water that can collect in the constructed aquifer, along with the large vertical area through which groundwater can flow in to the well, provides a much greater well yield than traditional dug wells, while maintaining sanitary conditions.

<SUBJECT>License Opportunity - Spectral method for determining the source of expanded vermiculite insulation in attics and walls
<SOLNBR>G15PS00074
<CONTACT>Benjamin Henry, Technology Enterprise Specialist, Email bhenry@usgs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, VA, is soliciting inquiries from companies interested in licensing rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued as exclusive or nonexclusive, and may include specific fields of use. USGS is not providing any funding in conjunction with the potential license. Technology title, "Spectral method for determining the source of expanded vermiculite insulation in attics and walls," US patent 8,751,169. <br /><br /><br />Background. Vermiculite is a naturally occurring mineral that has the unusual property of expanding into worm-like accordion shaped pieces when heated. The expanded vermiculite is a light-weight, fire resistant, absorbent, and odorless material. Prior to its close in 1990, much of the world's supply of vermiculite came from a mine near Libby, Montana. This mine had a natural deposit of asbestos which resulted in the vermiculite being contaminated with asbestos. Attic insulation produced using vermiculite ore, particularly ore that originated from the Libby mine, may contain asbestos fibers. This insulation was mostly used between 1920 and 1990. Today, vermiculite is mined at three U.S. facilities and in other countries which have low levels of contamination in the finished material. <br /><br />Abstract. A method for identifying the source of vermiculite insulation in situ, using a portable spectrometer with a light-emitting contact probe and a personal computer. Identification is accomplished using NIR reflectance spectroscopy and absorption band depth ratios to differentiate between vermiculite sources and to test for the presence of amphibole, talc, or serpentine contaminants in vermiculite insulation.<br /><br />Opportunity. The present invention relates in general to a method for classifying the source of insulation and, in particular, to a method for determining the source of expanded vermiculite insulation used in attics and walls. Visually differentiating vermiculites according to their source locations can be difficult. Traditional methods used to determine the source of expanded vermiculite samples involve time-consuming laboratory analysis using microscopic, electron probe microanalysis, x-ray fluorescence, and x-ray methods. These methods involve collection of vermiculite samples from an attic or wall, transport of the potentially hazardous samples to an off-site laboratory, and subsequent analysis to detect amphibole fibers. The methods are costly and generate hazardous waste that must be disposed of properly. In addition, property owners typically get the results of their analyses a week or more after the samples are collected. This invention allows for insulation inspectors to cost effectively test vermiculite insulation in a timely efficient manner. <br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to bhenry@usgs.gov with the title of this technology in the subject line. Include your preferred contact information and the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about other USGS technologies available for licensing, please visit http://www.usgs.gov/tech-transfer/available_patents.html<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of USGS's Office of Policy &amp; Analysis for the purpose of promoting public awareness of USGS owned technologies and conducting market research to determine commercial interest.

<DESC>***Please see attachment for easier viewing.***<br /><br />Long Range Research and Development Plan (LRRDP) Request for Information<br />This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to identify current and emerging technologies and/or projections of technology-enabled concepts that could provide significant military advantage to the United States and its partners and allies in the 2030 time frame.<br /><br />The Department is soliciting this information to focus the study and prioritization of novel or unconventional applications of technology in ways that would provide significant, enduring capability advantage to future US warfighting capabilities in conducting operations against a peer or near-peer competitor. We anticipate using this information to aid in the internal analysis and prioritization of DoD research and development investments.<br /><br />As part of the broader Defense Innovation Initiative, this RFI seeks to glean information that will explore and develop new technologies and approaches to warfighting, balancing DoD's investment between platforms, payloads, and networks. Our long-term security will depend on whether we can address today's crises while also planning and preparing for tomorrow's threats. Our superiority has never been guaranteed, and today it is being increasingly challenged. Technologies and weapons that were once the exclusive province of advanced nations have become available to a broad range of militaries and non-state actors. The current effort seeks to leverage the information collected in response to this RFI to draw on the lessons of previous offset strategies and ensure that America's power-projection capabilities continue to sustain our competitive advantage over the coming decades. <br /><br />Many, if not most, of the technologies that we seek to take advantage of today are no longer only the domain of DoD development pipelines or traditional defense contractors. DoD no longer has exclusive access to the most cutting-edge technology. This RFI actively seeks proposals from the private sector, including those firms and academic institutions outside DoD's traditional orbit.<br />Submissions should describe the operational opportunity; discuss the enabling technologies, and discuss the proposed methods for employing the technology. <br />Submissions to this RFI should be focused on technology-enabled capabilities that could be matured and would be available to enter formal development in the next 5-10 years, so as to provide an opportunity to offer significant military advantage in the 2025 to 2030 time frame. This focus restricts consideration to 1) relatively mature technologies that may be applied in novel or unique ways to field a fundamentally different type of system capability, 2) emerging technologies that can be rapidly matured to offer new military capability or 3) technologies under development for, or being applied in, non-defense applications which can be repurposed to offer a new military capability. <br /><br />Abstract Format
<p>Submissions shall not exceed ten-pages in length. Respondents are encouraged to provide multiple submissions if covering multiple technology concepts.<br />Submissions should include:<br />a) A one-page cover sheet that identifies the contact information including the title, organization, responder's points of contact (names, addresses, phone number, and e-mail addresses). This cover sheet does not count against the ten-page limit.<br />b) A one-page executive summary, summarizing key aspects of the response. This executive summary does not count against the ten-page limit.<br />c) The body of the response.<br />d) Figures, tables and drawings should be included within the ten-page limit. <br />e) References, if included, do not count against the ten-page limit.<br /><br />On the submission cover sheet, please annotate one or more of the following five categories to aid in assessing the submission<br />1. Space Technology<br />2. Undersea Technology<br />3. Air Dominance and Strike Technology<br />4. Air and Missile Defense Technology<br />5. Other Technology-Driven Concepts</p>
<p>Submissions are requested in electronic format as PDF (Portable Document Format) files (or equivalent).<br />Background</p>
<p>An examination of military history provides striking examples where an enduring advantage over potential adversaries was obtained through the introduction of new and innovative systems and technologically-enabled concepts that had a disruptive effect on the status quo. By identifying, maturing and leveraging key technologies to enable new military capabilities, nations have been able to reshape the balance of military competition to the advantage of the early adopter of these disruptive technical capabilities.<br /><br />The United States applied this way of thinking to great effect in the 1970s and 1980s, in addressing concerns about Soviet armored forces in Europe. The introduction of new precision-guided munitions capabilities, new platform concepts and reconnaissance and targeting capabilities shifted the nature of the military competition, negating the superior mass of Soviet armor through the ability to conduct precision strikes. The introduction of these new technology-enabled military capabilities disrupted the symmetrical nature of the competition, and enabled a shift in strategy that offset the natural advantages of the threat.<br />Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program (LRRDPP) of the 1970s<br />The offset strategy of the 1980's relied on a combination of technologies that grew out of a research and development plan developed in the mid-1970s. The purpose of the 1970s LRRDPP effort was to assess the potential shifts of emphasis in the U.S. Defense R&amp;D program required to offset emerging peer and near-peer capabilities. The LRRDPP analysts sought to identify the following information:<br />1. Those military capabilities that had the potential to make a significant difference in U.S. ability to cope with aggression;<br />2. Possible weapon and support system concepts that show considerable promise of providing these capabilities more effectively; and<br />3. Those technology programs that would have to be initiated or expanded to bring these concepts into reality.<br /><br />The LRRDPP effort approached the task by identifying improved military capabilities needed by the United States and its allies to fight and win conflicts more effectively in future conflicts, and by assessing the future state of the art of, and possible contributions to, advanced weapons systems by certain key technologies.<br /><br />The ultimate result of the effort was a set of recommendations to pursue specific technologies the LRRDPP participants deemed to be of strategic importance to reshaping the battlefield of the future. These recommendations for technology investment supported the development and maturation of capabilities such as advanced sensors for weapon guidance, data links, high-mobility vehicles, improved communication systems, cruise missiles, and remotely piloted vehicles. These capabilities first saw large-scale, integrated application in Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. In fact, the core of the U.S. military force structure and operational employment approach over the past 30 years is rooted in the technologies highlighted by the 1970s LRRDPP recommendations.<br /><br />Long-Range Research and Development Plan (LRRDP) of Today<br />With similar motivations, the department seeks to develop a new LRRDP. Rapidly advancing technologies provided the catalyst for the first LRRDPP effort, and today we see significant changes in the global technology landscape that compel a strategic evaluation of our research and development investment strategy. The current LRRDP study seeks to identify opportunities for enduring innovation and opportunities to sustain future U.S. military capability advantage in an era of increasing technology globalization, rapidly evolving technology, and tightening budgets. <br /><br />The current LRRDP effort is loosely modeled after the 1970s activity described above. The effort will be organized into the following five focus areas:<br />1. Space Technology<br />2. Undersea Technology<br />3. Air Dominance and Strike Technology<br />4. Air and Missile Defense Technology<br />5. Other Technology-Driven Concepts<br /><br />The objective is to identify high-payoff enabling technology opportunities that could shape key future U.S. materiel investments and offer opportunities to shape the trajectory of future competition for technical superiority, with a focus on technology and technology-enabled concepts that could provide significant military advantage to the United States and its partners and allies in the 2030 time frame. The effort emphasizes the innovative application of technologies that can be leveraged for asymmetric advantage.<br /><br />Abstract Submission</p>

The position provides planning, operational and logistical support, and contract oversight for a US Department of State (DoS) bilateral counter-narcotics (CN) aviation program in Colombia and its fleet of Department of State INL Office of Aviation (INL/A)  aircraft.   The objective of the bilateral CN aviation programs in Colombia is the curtailment of the supply of illegal drugs from Colombia into the United States through aerial eradication of illicit crops, interdiction of refining laboratories and trafficking activities, and related enforcement operations.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this personal services contract (PSC) position is to act as the Aerial Eradication Program Manager and provide as an advisor for the bilateral CN Aerial Eradication program in Colombia.

<p>ALTERNATIVE LINE ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(b) Evaluation. The Government-</p>
<p>(1) Will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of Part 225 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; and</p>
<p>(2) Will evaluate offers of qualifying country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program.</p>
<p>(c) Certifications and identification of country of origin.</p>
<p>(1) For all line items subject to the Buy American and Balance of Payments Program-Basic clause of this solicitation, the offeror certifies that-</p>
<p>(i) Each end product, except those listed in paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this provision, is a domestic end product; and</p>

<p>(2) The offeror certifies that the following end products are qualifying country end products:</p>
<p>Line Item Number Country of Origin</p>
<p>(3) The following end products are other foreign end products, including end products manufactured in the United States that do not qualify as domestic end products, i.e., an end product that is not a COTS item and does not meet the component test in paragraph (ii) of the definition of "domestic end product":</p>
<p>Line Item Number Country of Origin (If known)</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The infographic shall help the audience learn something and/or challenge them to think about the information in a new way.</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall be able to deliver the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Icons<br />&bull; Infographics<br />&bull; Banners for social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr)<br />&bull; Logos</p>
<p>In addition, information provided to the government by the prospective contractor should also address whether or not the contractor can deliver the following services, <em><strong>which are not required but which the Department has an interest in using</strong></em>, as well as the impact on any resulting contract, i.e., additional Labor Categories needed, higher labor rate(s) required, subcontractor needs, etc.:</p>
<p>&bull; Video infographics (10 seconds - 5 minutes) <br />&bull; Microsite layout design<br />&bull; Landing page layout design<br />&bull; Email layout<br />&bull; Power Point presentations or slides.</p>
<p>The projects shall offer compelling data and unique designs that magnify information and explain data and shall need to be delivered under extremely tight deadlines.</p>
<p>The Department contemplates issuing a Time &amp; Materials or Labor-hour (T&amp;M/LH) contract/purchase order. A contract ceiling amount will be established at the time of award. Infographic design for social media entails responding to trending issues that need to be addressed as soon as possible, and involves ever-changing operational requirements. It is not possible to determine how many projects will be required or how long individual projects will take. Due to this uncertainty, a T&amp;M/LH contract is needed. The purchase order period of performance will not exceed one year. The graphic designer or company that is selected shall be able to give OCO deliverables under extremely tight deadlines, ranging from as little as one hour notice to be delivered within an hour to one day notice with a few hours or an overnight deadline. There may also be longer term projects, as needed.</p>
<p>The work required under this purchase order will be driven by &lsquo;trending' information and influenced by daily events. Projects will be driven by the news cycle, data-driven reports and responses to what's trending in the education arena, which are difficult to predict. As a result, ED does not know what the required information/updates to the Department's social media presence may be at the time of award. In addition, the success of any project will be based upon the publics' subjective reaction to and understanding of the visual presentation.</p>
<p>ED anticipates individual tasks taking anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, a whole day or possibly longer term projects that require a few weeks. At the time of the assignment, ED may be able to estimate the amount of time it thinks will be required for the individual project.&nbsp; Assignments will be made by a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and, on occassion, other OCO staff.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of each significant task/assignment the contractor may be required to submit a cost estimate and brief project plan, to include description of the work to be performed, resources assigned (name, labor rate, hours), schedule/deliverables, and milestones (start date, completion date). Project significance will be determined by the scope, schedule, and cost of the subtask. Urgent and quick-hit (&lsquo;few minute') projects described above will be handled verbally between the Department and the contractor.</p>
<p>The contractor shall apply widely-accepted "best practices" of project management and technical oversight to all work conducted under this purchase order to monitor and control project progress, cost, and resources in relation to planned graphic tasks. The contractor's monthly invoice shall include burn-rate information and describe work-in-progress and funding status against the established contract ceiling for the T&amp;M/LH contract.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, labor, equipment, materials, supplies, supervision, staff, training, and other items and services necessary to perform the requirement. The contractor shall be responsible for performing the requirements in the contractor's facility and, on occasion, at Department headquarters in Washington, DC.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quotation Requirements:</span></strong></p>
<p>The quote must contain all information necessary to determine that the individual or organization can meet the technical requirements. The quote shall include a brief capabilities/experience section which demonstrates understanding of, and the capability to meet, the requirements, short list of client or organization references, and a detailed cost quote including labor categories, labor rates, any materials costs, etc. Quotes shall include links to samples of completed graphic projects. Quotes shall have a list of staff that will be doing the work and their experience, if it will involve more than one person.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria:</span></strong></p>
<p>The Department will negotiate with the contractor providing the quote determined to offer the best value based on the following: 1) contractor approach to meeting the work requirements described, including managing a T&amp;M/LH type contract; 2) labor rates; 3) experience and quality of individual or personnel; and 4) the demonstrated ability to deliver goods and services under tight deadlines. Technical quality will be evaluated based on demonstrated expertise in designing graphic materials to magnify information/messaging and aesthetic appeal of samples. Quoters that can meet all of the requirements, including the desired but not required services (Video infographics, Microsite layout design, Landing page layout design, Email layout, Power Point presentations or slides) will receive greater consideration for an offer. However, the Contracting officer shall determine whether any difference in technical evaluation is worth any differences in price. The Department will consider award to other than the lowest price quote or other than the highest technically rated quote.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provisions and Clauses:</span></strong></p>

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.</p>
<p>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200031 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78 effective 25 November 2014.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:</p>
<p>RIGHT HAND FUEL PIPE ASSY<br />P/N: 366A08-0540-15<br />NSN: 4730-01-HS1-7900<br />QTY: 4 EA<br />MFGCD: F0210<br />RDD: 10/18/15</p>

<p><br />All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France (Cage Code: F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.</p>
<p>Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Surge Staff Supervisor will be responsible for the overall management of the OTI Bullpen, an intermittent workforce consisting of approximately 35 high-level professionals and experts that support OTI overseas and domestically in a surge capacity. The Surge Staff Supervisor is a member of the Field Program Division (FPD) management team with the Division Chief and the Administrative Program Assistant, and a member of the FPD Regional Team Leaders group.</p>
<p>OTI uses the Bullpen to support a variety of functions throughout the office in Washington, DC and the field. The Surge Staff Supervisor is charged with managing the Bullpen and will have additional responsibilities of monitoring and evaluation, mentoring, and training (including on-the-job training). The incumbent will ensure that individuals serving in the Bullpen possess a minimum standard of knowledge about OTI and its country program functions throughout the standard OTI program cycle, in an effort to continually improve this important office resource.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS A FINAL SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
<p>1.&nbsp;This requirement is to provide a full range of responsive environmental remediation actions necessary to protect human health &amp; the environment. It includes rapid response and removal of environmental media contaminations and site restoration activities located on Base Realignment and Closure Bases (BRAC) in EPA regions 5-8 (Central). The BRAC Environmental Construction and Services Requirements Contract (BECSRC)&nbsp;will include a 5 year ordering period with 24 additional months for performance completion.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of soliciting and awarding this Requirements Contract is to have a tool in place for "pop-up" interim Environmental Remediation requirements. "Pop-ups" are unplanned, out-of-cycle requirements that occur periodically, but erratically on installations included in the BRAC Program Management Division portfolio. The BRAC Program Management Division, responsible for remediation and transfer of Air Force property affected by BRAC legislation, manages the disposal of Air Force property in accordance with BRAC law and the BRAC Master Plan to achieve early environmental resolution and early property disposal to return value to the Air Force and local communities. Requirements contracts are set up with&nbsp;ONE contractor to provide service and construction requirements&nbsp;(FAR 16.503). Generally speaking, an IDIQ obligates the Government to a minimum quantity/dollar amount at the time award, while a Requirements Contract guarantees the contractor no such minimum. <br /><br />3. The Contracting Officer (CO) will conduct this source selection using a phased evaluation process which is sometimes referred to as a "down-select." To make the process more efficient, the CO is limiting the amount of information that offerors must submit initially. The CO shall notify offerors promptly in writing when their proposals are excluded from the competitive range or otherwise eliminated from the competition after which Evaluation Notices (ENs) will be sent to offerors within the competitive range as needed. Those offerors considered by the CO to be within the competitive range will be asked to submit the Volume III (Pricing) and Volume IV (Sample Task Order) in Phase II of this source selection.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Questions concerning the Request for Proposal (RFP) and attachments are due by 2:00 PM CT on&nbsp;December 17, 2014 to: <a href="mailto:rita.leal@us.af.mil">rita.leal@us.af.mil</a>.</p>
<p>Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Jonathan Swall (Jonathan.Swall.1@us.af.mil) and Contract Specialist, Ms. Rita Leal at rita.leal@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&nbsp;AS OF DECEMBER 03, 2014</strong><br /><br /><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>The drawings you sent are excellent, the only issue is they reference other drawings that apparently contain additional information?<br /></strong><br /></span>The drawing itself is "sheet M3 of 5". <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the notes it also says to see M2 for elevation and other runway details?<br /><br /></span></strong>Yes, there are other prints with this project. We have added an item description with the package that gives the lift length for the hoist, the overall height from the floor to the bottom of the W12 x 58 beams that the Loudan Rail part number 605.1850 will attach is 22 feet 3 inches please see drawing.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can you please check and see if there are in fact other drawings available to be included?</span></strong>
<p>The drawing M3 of 5 is the only drawing pertaining to the crane we are requesting.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is someone else supplying and installing the runway and electrification for these cranes?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is a reference to drawing M2 for runways which is not included in the package.</span></strong></p>
<p>We already have the Loudan rail, and duct-o-bar. We are requesting only the cranes and delivery to us not insulation. The runways are referenced on drawing M3 of 5 and are on the item description Loudan Rail part number 605.1850.</p>

All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The Offeror who is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-price factors will be awarded the contract.    <br>    <br>  The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.  <br>  	  <br>  The Government reserves the right to award based on initial proposals.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the contract without discussions with the Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306).  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.    <br>    <br>  Minimum Acceptability: If an Offeror takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the solicitation, the offer may not be considered for contract award.  All Offerors are urged to ensure that their initial proposals are submitted with the most favorable terms in order to reflect their best possible potential.  <br>    <br>  FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED:  <br>    <br>  The Government will evaluate each proposal and the SSA will assess the results of the following Factors, listed below:  <br>    <br>  Factor 1 - Technical  <br>  Factor 2 - Price  <br>    <br>    <br>  Factor 1 - Technical  <br>    <br>  The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.  <br>    <br>  In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the Offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements:   <br>    <br>  a. Technical Approach: The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work (SOW) to provide commercial digital instrumentation in support of the Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS).  The proposal will be evaluated in terms of the contractor's ability to provide the exact items identified in the SOW, in the exact quantities identified in the SOW, and provide deliveries in the allotted period of performance. The Offeror shall provide the Government with a delivery schedule for the delivery of all items. The schedule shall indentify the entire period of performance of the contract broken down into monthly increments. The increments shall identify the number of deliverables for the months including hardware and associated documentation and shall include the number of instruments that shall be returned to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for credit and its ability to minimize negative impacts on the NGATS Mission.  <br>    <br>  Proposals will be evaluated to determine an Offeror's Understanding of the Requirements and Feasibility of Approach.    <br>    <br>  (1) Understanding the Requirements - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear and complete understanding of all requirements involved, including capabilities, knowledge and expertise as defined in the SOW.   <br>    <br>  (2) Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the SOW requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.   <br>    <br>  ADJECTIVAL      DEFINITION  <br>  RATING 	  <br>    <br>  ACCEPTABLE	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>    <br>  UNACCEPTABLE	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the 			solicitation.  <br>    <br>  Factor 2 - Price  <br>    <br>  1. The Total Evaluated Price is the summed value of CLINs 0001, 0002, and 0003. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b).  Price will not be scored.   <br>    <br>  2. Adequate competition is anticipated for this contract.  However, in the event that only one offer is received, the Government reserves the right to perform a cost analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(c).  Therefore, in instances when only one offer is received , the Contracting Officer shall obtain Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data.  Offerors shall utilize a Microsoft Excel file format with formulas intact when submitting their Price/Cost quote (FAR 15.403-5(b)(1)).  <br>    <br>  3. Price/Cost Inconsistencies:  A proposal is presumed to represent an Offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation.  Each initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms for award for this contract.  Any inconsistencies in performance or price should be explained in the proposal.  Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the Offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of work required and its financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.    <br>    <br>  DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY:  <br>    <br>  As an element of determining the responsibility of Offerors, a Certificate of Competency may be required by the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 19.6.  <br>    <br>  A Pre-award Survey may be required by the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 9.106.  <br>

Award will be made to the offeror who provides the lowest total evaluated price, who is deemed responsible, and who is compliant with all the requirements of this solicitation, to include submission requirements listed under  quote mark Quote Submission Requirements quote mark  below.  Award will be made on a Firm Fixed Price basis.  Price evaluation is as follows:          <br>                    <br>          1. The offeror will enter unit prices for all shoe styles for the base year and each evaluated option year on the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet's first tab titled Summary of Unit Prices.  All unit prices shall be binding.          <br>                    <br>          2. The Government reserves the right to require submission of any data necessary to validate the reasonableness of an offer.          <br>                    <br>          3. Based on procurement history, the majority of purchases have been for the 5 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix.  The Government will evaluate offers based on unit prices proposed for these 5 shoe styles on the base year and each evaluated option year.  If an offeror fails to propose all of the unit prices for the base and evaluated option years, the Government may reject that offer as unacceptable.          <br>                    <br>          4. For each proposal, the Government will calculate a weighted evaluated price by multiplying the proposed unit prices for the 5 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix, by their respected weights, and summing their totals.  The weight associated with each unit price, represents the likelihood among the most 5 prevalent shoe styles purchased, that an order, if placed, would be placed for that shoe style at the quoted unit price.          <br>                    <br>          5. A Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the weighted evaluated prices for the 5 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix for the base year and each evaluated option year.          <br>                    <br>          6. Price Analysis shall be used to determine price reasonableness.  Additional analysis techniques may be used as determined necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer.  These methods of evaluation may include the use of information/input from sources such as (but not limited to) other Government agencies and personnel.          <br>                    <br>          7. As part of the evaluation, proposals may be reviewed to identify any significant unbalanced pricing found between the base year and evaluated option years.  In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), i.e., Unbalanced Pricing, a proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.          <br>                    <br>          CLAUSES:          <br>                    <br>          See Attachment 0002 - Contract Clauses for the clauses which are applicable to this solicitation.          <br>                    <br>          QUOTE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:          <br>                    <br>          Offerors shall submit quotes by completing Attachment 0003 - Price Evaluation Spreadsheet.            <br>                    <br>          In the event an offeror is not registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), the offeror shall fill-in and return FAR Clause 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items located in Attachment 0002 - Contract Clauses.

The Government will award the contract to the offeror that meets all the evaluation criteria with an  quote mark Acceptability quote mark  rating, and has the lowest price.  Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors will not be permitted.    <br>        <br>    As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price.  Offerors are required only to price the base and option periods.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential six month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period.  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.    <br>        <br>    In the event of an unacceptable Past Performance evaluation rating for an otherwise Technically Acceptable low price offeror, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event an offeror receives a rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the offeror would remain  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.     <br>        <br>    Discussions or Negotiations:  The offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final offers will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial offers.      <br>        <br>    Award for All of the Work:  The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation.  Offers received with less than the stated number of items listed in the Bid Schedule will be considered non- responsive and therefore, not considered for award.    <br>        <br>    Evaluation Criteria.    <br>         <br>    (1)	Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  Offers will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:    <br>        <br>    Factor I:  Technical Capability    <br>    1.	Acceptability Standard 1: Experience    <br>    2.	Acceptability Standard 2: Capability     <br>        <br>    Factor II:  Past Performance 							    <br>    Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  In evaluating Past Performance, Quality of Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated.    <br>        <br>    Factor III:  Price    <br>        <br>    Factor I:  Technical Acceptability:  The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.      <br>        <br>    Acceptability Standard 1: Equipment Offerings: Offeror provides evidence that provided equipment is in compliance with paragraphs 4.2; 4.2.1; 4.2.2; 4.2.3; 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 of the PWS. Offeror shall provide sufficient descriptive literature so that the Government may determine that the offeror products meet the salient characteristics listed in the aforementioned PWS paragraphs. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.    <br>        <br>    Acceptability Standard 2:  Experience:  The offeror demonstrates experience in providing the washers and dryers required along with outlined services as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The offeror shall submit a list of recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant contracts/subcontracts that demonstrate an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation.    <br>        <br>    The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.     <br>        <br>    Table 1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings    <br>    Rating	Description    <br>    Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.    <br>    Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.    <br>        <br>    (2)	Factor II: Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.    <br>        <br>    There is no minimum or maximum number of references required; however, the offeror shall submit sufficient past performance information to demonstrate the depth and breadth to successfully satisfy all areas of the proposed effort.  It is incumbent upon the contractor to present the past performance information in such a manner and in sufficient detail to ensure the Government clearly understands the information provided.    <br>        <br>    Each offeror will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.      <br>        <br>    Recency Assessment:  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.    <br>        <br>    Relevancy Assessment:  To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offeror's contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the offer and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.    <br>        <br>    The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.      <br>        <br>    The Past Performance Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.    <br>        <br>    Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings    <br>    Rating	Description    <br>    Acceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.    <br>     Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.    <br>        <br>        <br>    Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered acceptable.    <br>        <br>    (3)	Factor III: Price:  The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b).  Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.    <br>        <br>    Options.  Pricing submitted for the Offeror Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, and one-half of the second option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the offeror whose offer represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable offer.    <br>        <br>    Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.    <br>        <br>    Offers are due no later than 24 November 2014; 4:00 PM CST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency.  In accordance with 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, paragraph (f), quotes received after the established closing date will be viewed as late, and therefore not considered.  Offers may be submitted via email (preferred) to jennifer.m.snook2.mil@mail.mil or via mail to MICC - Fort Campbell, ATTN: SFC Jennifer Snook, 6923 38th and Desert Storm Ave, Fort Campbell, KY  42223-5355.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Subject to the provisions contained herein, the Government intends to award a single contract resulting from the Solicitation, to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose Proposal conforms to the Solicitation's requirements (to included all stated terms, conditions, and all other information required by the Solicitation), and provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to satisfy the requirements of this Solicitation and the PWS.  <br>    <br>     a. Evaluation criteria consist of two (2) evaluation factors. The Proposals will be evaluated under the following evaluation factors:   <br>    <br>  	Factor 1: Technical Capability   <br>  	  <br>  	Factor 2: Price  <br>    <br>     b. Evaluation Factors. The Government's technical evaluation team will evaluate proposals to determine either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable (price excluded).   In order to be considered technically acceptable, the proposal for Factor 1 must be determined acceptable and must demonstrate an understanding of the requirements for all task areas described in the PWS. The proposal must demonstrate a practical/functional technical approach that meets the needs of the Solicitation. Failure to meet the criteria will render the proposal to be technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.  <br>    <br>        1) Factor 1: Technical Capability - To be deemed technically acceptable, the Offeror's Mission Capability must demonstrate:  <br>    <br>  a) An understanding of all tasks specified in this solicitation and describes how the requirement will be satisfied through clear methodologies, techniques, and detailed technical approach to meet the required objectives in the performance of technical requirements identified in PWS.  In evaluating, the assessment will concentrate on the offeror's plans for accomplishing the PWS requirements, to include proposed processes, schedule, and approaches.  Each proposal shall be evaluated on its ability to demonstrate a clear understanding of the contractual requirements and a corresponding plan to fulfill those performance requirements in the most effective and efficient manner possible for each functional task area.    <br>     <br>  b) Organizational Structure.  The organizational line and block chart shall demonstrate a feasible structure to successfully manage the PWS requirements. An effective organizational structure that demonstrates whether the Offeror has all the necessary personnel qualifications, processes and plans in effect to ensure contract performance in accordance with the requirements of the PWS.  Personnel qualifications and minimum requirements for job standards must adequately support the requirements of the PWS.   The proposal must clearly demonstrate that all requirements of the PWS are met through identifying what parts of the organization are responsible for managing and accomplishing what work and clearly and rationally identify how the Offeror will successfully manage multiple tasks.   <br>    <br>        2) Factor 2: Price. The Offeror's price submission of all CLINs and Options will be evaluated considering the response to the solicitation.  The techniques and procedures described under FAR Part 15.404 will be the primary means of assessing price reasonableness.  <br>    <br>     2. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  As part of price evaluation, the government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the Offeror's final option period price to the Offeror's total price.  Thus, the Offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the Base Period, 1st Option Period, 2nd Option Period, 3rd Option Period, 4th Option Period, and 1/2 of the 4th Option Period. Offerors are not required to enter a price for the six-month period.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).    <br>    <br>     3. A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <br>    <br>  (End of provision)  <br>    <br>  As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding six (6) months of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price.  Offerors are required only to price the base and option periods.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential six month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period.  <br>    <br>  (x) Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

<p>The Truckee River Bridge Project proposes improvements to resolve the existing, deteriorated condition of the Truckee River Bridge (locally known as "Fanny Bridge") and the existing traffic congestion at the wye intersection of State Route (SR) 28 and 89, located in Tahoe City, Placer County, California. The project site extends approximately 1.15 miles on SR 28 and 0.8 mile on SR 89. The proposed improvements are designed to enhance motorized and non-motorized mobility, reduce traffic congestion, accommodate anticipated future increases in traffic, increase access across the Truckee River, address existing pedestrian and traffic safety concerns, and encourage revitalization of the local Tahoe City community.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Under one of the Alternatives being evaluated, SR 89 would be realigned as a new two-lane segment of highway that would cross through USFS's 64-Acre Tract. The western end of the new segment would begin at a new single-lane roundabout, which would serve as the new SR 89/SR 28 intersection. A new bridge over the Truckee River would be constructed immediately to the southeast of the roundabout on the new roadway segment. The new alignment would continue east and reconnect to existing SR 89 at a single-lane roundabout near the existing changeable message sign and sled hill. Realignment of SR 89 and construction of the new bridge would include modifications to the existing Caltrans maintenance facility, construction of retaining walls, realignment of an existing sewer main line, and realignment of existing bike paths. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fanny Bridge would be rehabilitated or replaced to address the existing structural deficiencies and resolve safety and community concerns. Traffic calming and aesthetic features would be installed within this section of roadway (e.g., reduced speed limit, bulb-outs, landscaped areas, raised landscaped median, on-street parking, sidewalks, street lighting, benches, etc.). New parking or landscaping may replace the existing free-right turns.</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Meeks Bay Shared Use Path Project comprises of a 0.6-mile long, 10 foot wide, Class 1 Bike Path commencing near the southern boundary of the Sugar Pine Point State Park and extending southward to the Meeks Bay Resort. Currently, the west shore trail system terminates at Sugar Pine Point State Park which requires bicyclist and pedestrians to share right-of-way (ROW) with auto traffic on California State Route 89 (SR 89) or terminate their trip altogether prior to reaching Meeks Bay Resort.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Project is located on the west shore of Lake Tahoe approximately 2 miles south of Tahoma and 19 miles northwest of South Lake Tahoe in eastern El Dorado County, California. The Project area extends eastward from the centerline of SR 89 to the eastern extent of land disturbance necessary for project construction. The proposed bike path generally maintains a northeast inclination adjacent to SR 89.</p>

<DESC>General Information<br />Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive Room 1E140 Rockville, MD 20850.
<p>Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with ProteinSimple , 3040 Oakmead Village Dr. Santa Clara, CA 95051-0808 maintenance services for two (2) ProteinSimple Peggy Sue Instruments, serial numbers MV-0108 and MV-0111.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.<br /><br />The laboratory currently houses two (2) ProteinSimple Peggy Sue instruments which are used for nanoscale quantitative proteomics assessment, quantitative dissection of cell signaling events, biomarker development, therapeutic target identification, and proteomic analysis of clinical specimens. These instruments are in daily use and are one of the primary research tools in the core facility. Many experiments, if unable to be run on the instrument as scheduled, cannot be rescued, particularly patient samples from the clinical center. These samples are very precious and are unfortunately impossible to rerun after an instrument failure. Maintaining these instruments in their optimal condition is essential to the work LCB does and for the services LCB provides to the CCR community. It is also critical that LCB receives quick response time, unlimited technical and software updates and support. ProteinSimple is the patent holder of this proprietary technology; in addition, they are the only company that can provide the LCB facility with unlimited technical and software support including software updates.</p>
<p>SPECIFICATIONS/SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED:</p>
<p>In order to maintain optimal performance and to minimize down time, the LCB requires maintenance services for the two (2) Peggy Sue Instruments that includes:</p>
<p>1) REPAIR SERVICE: Telephone support and On-site repair service shall be provided during the term of this contract at no additional cost to the government. The services shall be available during the hours of 9am and 5pm within the time zone where the instrument resides, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays during the duration of this maintenance contract. The Government may contact the contractor via telephone during the hours of operation to report any malfunction of the instruments. The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of a service request within two (2) hours. If the service request cannot be resolved over the telephone, the contractor shall dispatch a field engineer within three (3) business days after a service request is made to restore the equipment to normal and efficient operating condition. The Contract covers the instruments in its entirety, unless specifically excluded in this contract. The contractor shall provide unlimited technical support and trouble-shooting for the instruments, reagents, and applications during normal working hours, except Federal holidays.<br /><br />2) REPLACEMENT PARTS: The contractor shall furnish all required replacement parts at no additional cost to the Government, with the exception of consumables. Parts shall be new or re-manufactured to the original equipment specifications.</p>
<p>3) SOFTWARE UPDATES/SERVICE: The software support and maintenance services include the following services at no additional cost to the Government:</p>
<p>a. The contractor shall answer technical questions concerning functions and features of the software; <br />b. The contractor shall provide error verification, analysis and corrective efforts for the software; and <br />c. The contractor shall provide, without charge, updates of the software released during the term of this Agreement. <br />As used herein, "Updates" means those releases of the software that the contractor provides to licensees to correct errors, fix bugs, or create minor improvements, incremental features, or enhancements of existing features. Updates do not include those releases of the software that provide substantial new features or additional functionality. Any update of the software will be deemed part of the software and will be used in accordance with the requirements and obligations in the license agreement for the software. <br />The contractor will not be obligated to provide the software support services if a malfunction is caused by third party hardware/software (not installed by the Contractor) or if the Government fails to incorporate the latest software recommended by the Contractor. <br />4) EXCLUSIONS FROM SUPPORT: In addition to the exclusions provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, the Contractor shall not be responsible for any repairs necessitated by abuse, neglect, vandalism, Acts of God, fire, or water. These repairs shall not be performed under this contract.</p>
<p>5) WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER: The contractor shall warrant that the replacement parts will be free from defects in materials and workmanship during the period equal to the greater of (i) ninety (90) days after the date of the installation or (ii) the remaining term of this Agreement. For breach of the foregoing warranty, the Contractor will, at its option and expense and as the Government's exclusive remedy, repair or replace the defective replacement during the warranty period.</p>
<p>6) SERVICE EXCLUSIONS: The contractor shall not be responsible for any repairs necessitated by abuse, neglect, vandalism, the use of unauthorized parts or reagents, Acts of God, fire or water. These repairs shall be the subject of a separate purchase order and shall not be performed under this contract.</p>
<p>7) PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Performance shall be from January 01, 2015 to December 31, 2015.</p>
<p>8) PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: Personnel shall be certified&nbsp;by the manufacturer in the servicing of the equipment herein. All primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support person.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, especially small businesses, they may submit a tailored statement of capabilities email. In addition, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the NCI.

<DESC>The purpose of this Special Notice is to conduct market research as required by the Acquisition Planning Process outlined in Part 7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS; NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE.  <br>    <br>  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), South Atlantic Division (SAD) is contemplating the reissuance of the Regional Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Maintenance Dredging within the Boundaries of USACE, SAD.

Task orders for work that has been historically set-aside for small business will be set-aside under the MATOC in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).  Task orders will range in value from $1M to $25M.   <br>    <br>    <br>  Source Selection:  <br>    <br>  The award of the MATOC will be based on factors other than price; thus, competitive proposals will be requested and evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 15 and FAR Part 6.401(b)(1).  <br>    <br>  The Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process will be used to award contracts and Task Orders under the MATOC in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 based on the following technical evaluation factors: Technical Acceptability of Equipment, Bonding and Past Performance.  <br>    <br>  - Technical Acceptability of Equipment - Offerors must prove that they OWN at least one of the following: Coast Guard Certified Hopper Dredge, Coast Guard Certified Mechanical Dredge or a 14 inch or larger Cutter Suction Dredge.   <br>    <br>  -Technical Acceptability of Equipment for Task Orders- Offerors must identify the MATOC approved equipment (dredge) which will perform the work as stated within the RFP.

In addition, the Government intends to include paragraphs materially similar to the following in the MATOC regarding the release of information after the receipt of task order proposals:  <br>    <br>   quote mark (a) Within two (2) working days of receipt of proposals, all contractors in the Group/Pool will be notified of the apparent successful offeror regardless of whether or not they submitted a proposal. However, the Contracting Officer reserves the rights to extend the notice period as needed. Task Orders will be awarded within 60 days from the receipt of proposals, unless otherwise stated in the task order RFP.  <br>    <br>  (b) If at the time of initial review it cannot be determined as to the apparent successful  <br>  offeror, no notification will be provided. Offerors who submitted a proposal will be notified within two (2) working days of receipt of proposals if additional review and/or discussions will be required. The name of the apparent awardee will not be provided until the time of award if discussions are necessary.  <br>    <br>  (c) Offerors may withdraw (in writing) their proposal for any Task Order at any time prior to award of the task order in accordance with FAR 15.208(e).  <br>    <br>  (d) All parties agree that the release of the name of the apparent successful offeror under the conditions described in this modification is in compliance with the Procurement Integrity Act, the Competition in Contracting Act, and the Trades Secret Act.  The contractor hereby releases the Government from any and all liability under this contract for release of this information. quote mark   <br>    <br>  - Request a waiver of the requirement for bid guarantees to be submitted with proposals for both the basic contract and all task orders.  <br>    <br>  - Request a legal determination that task order proposals may be submitted electronically.    <br>    <br>  - Incorporate all technical specifications, to the maximum practical extent, into the basic contract eliminating the need to include the same technical specifications in every task order.  <br>    <br>  - Allow the use of the Continuing Contracts Clause in task orders if proper approval is granted.  Specific approval will be required for each task order that includes the Continuing Contracts Clause.  <br>    <br>    <br>  - Request a blanket waiver of DFARS 215.371-2 for emergency projects and projects that affect National security.  DFARS 215.371-2 requires the re-advertisement of contract actions for 30 additional days that have been advertised for less than 30 days and resulted in the receipt of only one offer.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Public Communication:  <br>    <br>  - Once the Acquisition Plan is approved and the MATOC is initially drafted, the Government intends to hold an Industry Day to present the draft MATOC for comments and questions from Industry to increase awareness of the procurement and further refine the MATOC before the solicitation is issued.  <br>    <br>  - Once the solicitation is issued, the Government intends to hold a Pre-Proposal Conference to review the solicitation requirements with Industry.  <br>    <br>  - After award of the MATOC, the Government intends to continue to utilize the Federal Business Opportunities Website for issuing task orders and task order award notices.  The Government will also communicate to the maximum extent practicable with contractors through electronic mail (e-mail).  <br>    <br>    <br>  Response Instructions:  <br>    <br>  If you are interested in participating in this procurement please respond to this Special Notice.  Your response should include: your name and contact information, your firms name, which equipment types your firm owns (see list above), your firm's socioeconomic status, if applicable (i.e. Small Business, SBA Certified 8(a), HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, etc.) and any questions you have regarding this procurement.  <br>    <br>  Responses to this Special Notice must be received not later than 14 January 2015 and shall be sent to the attention of Mr. John Vohlken via e-mail to john.d.vohlken@usace.army.mil.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA.    <br>    <br>  After responses are received, the Contracting Officer may conduct a Follow-Up Conference to publically discuss this procurement.  An amendment will be issued under this Special Notice with specific instructions if a Follow-Up Conference is to be held.  <br>

This amendment also revises the estimated solicitation release date to state, The solicitation will be issued on or about 11 December 2014.  <br>    <br>  1. Question:  We have also followed the track of this solicitation and have noticed that an US construction company have asked you on December 2013 if the solicitation requirements could be satisfied by having these categories made available through a written agreement with suitable companies through the Italian process of quote mark avvalimento quote mark as per D.P.R. 207/2010 and D.L. 163/2006 art. 49. Since 2010 a new D.P.R. 207 was issued which supersedes the D.P.R. 34 of January 2000, and you have answered that the U.S. does not acknowledge that method as a means of qualification.  I am wondering if since then has been changes on the origin of this answer and if actually a partnership with Italian companies which satisfy the requirements could be valid for qualification of the JV.   <br>    <br>  Answer: The U.S. Government will allow the qualification by means of the avvalimento procedure. As such, the U.S. does acknowledge that method as a means of qualification.  <br>    <br>  2. Question: The Pre-Solicitation Notice states that interested offerors may fax, hand deliver, or mail their Pre-Qualification packages. Could the pre-qualification documents be e-mailed? In the case that the U.S. Government may still require hard copies, please specify submittal requirements (number of copies that are required, etc.)    <br>    <br>  Answer: The Government will allow one (1) copy submission of fax, email, hand deliver, or mail the requirements of all Italy pre-qualifications due by Thursday, 04 December 2014 at 1500 hours Central European Time (CET). However, the offeror must provide one (1) hard copy of all original Italy pre-qualifications in response to the solicitation or your firm will not be considered.  Only those offerors who meet the requirements of the prequalification phase are allowed to enter into the solicitation phase.  <br>    <br>  3. Question:  Referring to presolicitation No. W912GB-15-R-0003, the undersigned company asks for clarification on the following point:  Are we allowed to COMPLETELY SUBCONTRACT the OG3, OG6, OG12 categories and then absorbing the relative amounts with the main OG1 category?  If it is allowed, in the pre-qualification phase, is the name of the subcontractor the only thing to be specified?  <br>    <br>  Answer:  The prime is required to pre-qualify in the prevailing category OG-1. However, if the prime is not pre-qualified in all minor categories, the subcontractor is required to be qualified in the remainder of the minor categories in order to pre-qualify for the S.O.A. requirements.

<DESC>This is a modification to the pre-solicitation notice posted on 31 October 2014. <br>  <br> The Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide non-personal, healthcare housekeeping and related services in support of multiple Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the health service area of Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) to include MTFs located in Fort Hood, TX; Copperas Cove, TX, and Killeen, TX.  This acquisition is solicited as an 8(a) set-aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.204(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720.  This solicitation will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria.  The agency proposes to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare housekeeping services will be issued.  An IDIQ contract is the optimum contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type Ill, IV, V, etc.) cannot be determined on a MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award.  The resultant FFP task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe CRDAMC MTF-specific healthcare housekeeping requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the 8(a) contractor's cost experience in performing this contract.  All services shall be firm-fixed price and subject to the Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. 351).  The solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line items (CLINS) with 5-year ordering periods.  The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for post-award conference.  The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against FY 15 funds.  Further obligations will arise as task orders are awarded and obligations will be charged to the fiscal year in which the order is placed.  Healthcare housekeeping services are required for 60 months starting 1 July 2015 through 30 June 2020.  All elements of the RFP shall be submitted by the Offeror with a proposal no later than the date/time shown in block 8 of the Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/Contract Order for Commercial Items.  The square feet (SF) for cleaning of each MTF is varied; however, the estimated SF for CRDAMC MTFs is 1,663,626 SF.   <br>  <br> This solicitation will be available in electronic format only.  The official access point to the solicitation is via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.

<DESC>*********************************************************
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VISA Contingency Contract - Liner T&amp;C's - Pricing Update</strong></p>
<p>As previously noted in the VISA contingency contract renewal announcement, the specific liner terms and conditions were not included and were being validated and reconciled with current Universal Services Contract (USC) and Regional Domestic Contract (RDC) liner requirements as applicable. As the process evolved, questions regarding redundancy and needs in an activated VISA state were discussed and internal government recommendations considered. In addition, the VISA liner pricing bid schedule was analyzed and strings of service and rates on contract reviewed. In the end, we agreed that we may be best served by seeking industry recommendations prior to revising or validating historic VISA contingency contract terms, conditions and pricing that may already exist within our peacetime contracts and sufficiently meet our needs in a contingency state. Additionally, the Rate Methodologies previously approved and utilized will remain unchanged (Revenue Based, Peacetime and Negotiated) for pricing both charter and liner service; however, we will propose revising how the DCAA audits are to be conducted.</p>
<p>Beyond improving the VISA contingency contracts, our goal in moving forward with the FY16 VISA renewal is to keep the process less onerous for industry. Linking VISA to the USC and RDC contracts of record and supplementing only the VISA liner contingency terms and conditions is something we'd like to explore at the industry day and may serve both industry and government best. Following discussions, we'll post the recommended supplemental VISA liner terms and conditions as well as pricing instructions. The purpose of this Industry Day is to discuss the draft documents already posted and recommended ways forward for the FY16 VISA contingency contract renewal. We look forward to lively discussions and your recommendations. An agenda is being formulated and will posted within the next few days.<br /><br />In light of our planned way forward with liner terms and conditions, we request VISA contingency contract questions, comments, thoughts, concerns for industry day discussions be submitted via email no later than noon <strong>8 December 2014</strong> in addition to planned attendance. Carriers interested in attending the Industry Day need to submit an email to Melinda Lewis (melinda.j.lewis9.civ@mail.mil), Dave Hoag (david.m.hoag.civ@mail.mil), and Nick Weiss (nicholas.e.weiss.civ@mail.mil) that includes your company name, number of attendees and contact information.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-14-101-Secondary Electrical Panel Correction, projected at the George E. Wahlen Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt Lake City, Utah 84148. This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB) Set-aside. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The George E. Wahlen Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) is seeking an Architect/Engineering (A/E) firm to provide all A/E services for the investigation, preparation of working drawings, construction documents and cost estimates for the "Secondary Electrical Panel Correction" project at the George E. Wahlen VAMC 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt Lake City, Utah 84148. This project will design electrical systems in order to separate the existing electrical system of the main patient care building, building 14, into three zones so that each zone can be isolated electrically from each other. The building is currently separated into zones A, B, and C and the electrical towers that will house each zoned electrical system will be built as the third phase of this project (not part of this design) will match this zoning for the electrical system.  There are multiple runs of electrical feeds for the various panels that must route through each floor of the towers and the towers (towers designed in a subsequent project) must be sized to accommodate these feeds and still leave appropriate clearance per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70 for panel placement.  The A/E vendor is to consider future construction that will be in the vicinity of the towers in their design.  The designs must coordinate appropriately; as such the selected A/E will need to interface with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) on all aspects of the project to ensure compliance with the other projects.

VISN 5
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  

Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 5, 849 International Drive, Suite 215, Linthicum, MD 21090

Requisition No. Funded/Paid thru VA Form 138, Obligation or Change in Obligation, in accordance with Volume II - Chapter 6 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 
 
Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), the VA has a requirement which can only be reasonably met by a single supplier.  This action is to establish a new Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor Easter Seals Adult Day Care for Adult Day Health Care services.  Services at this time may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow on contract, when it is likely that an award to another source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The Martinsburg VA Medical Center (MT VAMC) anticipates entering into a sole source acquisition negotiation for eligible Veterans to "continue" receiving Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) services located in Hagerstown, Md.

Easter Seals Adult Day Care Center is currently supporting the Martinsburg VAMC by providing service which would otherwise require nursing home placement.  ADHC services will be furnished to Veterans in the community for whom such care is specifically authorized by the Martinsburg VAMC.  Provided services include Registered Nurse/Case Manager to VA veteran patients.

The Government anticipates awarding a Basic Ordering Agreements, in accordance with FAR 16.703. A binding contract is will be formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this BOA, when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agrees non-VA is required and the contractor agrees to accept the patient and provide direct patient care services. Upon acceptance by the Contractor of beneficiaries of VA, all clauses and terms and conditions of this BOA shall apply and become a part of the resultant contract during such time as VA patient remains in the contractor care at the expense of VA. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 
    
A sole source award will be made to Easter Seals Adult Day Center for continuous services to veterans and eligible beneficiaries.  Easter Seals Adult Day Center hereafter referred to as "ADHC" will provide care to include: activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, adult day health care services.  Striving to meet and maintain the healthcare needs and promote maximum wellbeing, a break in continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and "negatively" impact the quality of life for this aged Veteran population who require critical assisted services and supportive environment.

This Basic Ordering Agreement cost estimate is as follow:
(5)-Five Year Cost Estimate:  $236,566.34.

Period of Performance	Annual Amount	Annual Income	Increase Amount	Annual Amount
Base Period	$45,915.00	0.00%	$0.00	$45,915.00
Option Period 1	$45,915.00	1.50%	$688.73	$46,603.73
Option Period 2	$46,603.73	1.50%	$699.06	$47,302.78
Option Period 3	$47,302.78	1.50%	$709.54	$48,012.32
Option Period 4	$48,012.32	1.50%	$720.18	$48,732.51
Grand Est. 5 Years	 	 	 	$236,566.34


"	COR's IGCE: $236,566.34
"	Contracting Officer's (CO) Cost Estimate: Placements will be made in contract facilities based in availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility; the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.  However, based on a usage rate of one 1 veteran for 108 days, a reasonable estimate for the value of any particular contract would be around $8,152.69 per year, with many facilities experiencing authorized Veteran populations in excess of 5 per year.  Daily rate differ depending on negotiated terms based on the Medicare Rate. Five-(5) Year estimate: $236,566.34
								      
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) (A): Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.	

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

As noted in paragraph 3, ADHC services are essential to the provision of planned programming designed to promote social and health related services to aging Veterans in the service area who are no longer able to manage independently or who are isolated without an essential support network to facilitate needed care services.  A break in the continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and negatively impact the wellbeing of the aged Veteran population who require assisted services and supportive environment.  Recompleting the services would result in a change in services to the existing Veterans who already are enrolled and receiving service based on medical necessity for years.  

Veterans with long term psychiatric conditions or organic brain dysfunctions would likely experience a decline in functioning or experience an exacerbation in their level of functioning mentally, emotionally, and physically resulting from a disruption or change in vendor.  A decrease in stability could potentially lead to irreversible harm or even death. (Note: stability with respect to such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of an individual from a vendor).  Consistency in their therapeutic milieu is warranted.  The primary goal is to maintain or restore the Veteran to the highest attainable level of health and well-being, thus Veteran treatment should be focused on stabilizing symptoms as much as possible.  The benefit of a supportive environment would serve both veterans and their caregivers.

Discontinuation of the current contract services will cause an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirement for Veteran support and cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

The current facility have and will continue to meet all state licensing requirements including the state requirement pertaining to level of medical liability insurance.
  
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
	
	A notice of Intent to sole source will be published on FedBizOpps.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

Payment to the ADHC is subject to the State Medicaid rates which change semi-annually; however, our agreement allows only an annual change to reduce administration.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Research was conducted on a limited basis due to the limitation of the geographic area. Research was conducted to establish ADHC contract services located throughout the local VA's catchment area to provide homemaker services to Veterans near or as near as possible to family or friends.  Market research for future agreements is dependent on the needs of the patient's population in the catchment area and resources availability of the VA Medical Center. The objective is to maximize patient care while maintaining compliance with VA regulations.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Continuing service is critical to Veterans to sustain a quality of life at an acceptable level.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

Not Applicable for this requirement. 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  				
The Contracting Office has identified way to improve and increase competition for the medical services in areas where completion can be considered. Approval not to compete does require VA Director and Chief of Staff approved prior to acquiring the medical services.  The procurement action will be posted to the Government Point of Entry.  Any responses will be referred the GEC coordinator for future consideration and marker research of source availability.

<DESC>Contract HSHQWA-10-A-00002 was awarded on March 17, 2010, with a performance start date of May 1, 2010 for PSO services throughout the State of Alaska. The current contract Ordering Period, Ordering Period IV, is set to expire on September 30, 2014. This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limited sources justification and approval." The proposed 4-month BPA extension is to acquire continued PSO services from October 1, 2014 through January 31, 2014 at an approximate value of $1,507,268.89. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is there is only one source capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. <br />
