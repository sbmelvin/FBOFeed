<DESC>A.  DIGITAL RESOURCE ACQUISITION 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO), in preparation and planning for an apparent transition from aerial film to direct digital acquisition for natural resource aerial photography projects, is requesting information related to price factors.  The hypothetical project proposed in this RFI, in the geographic area listed in Paragraph C, is for planning purposes only.  This request for information is strictly an exercise for planning and pricing purposes only that will NOT result in any contract.  The Government is requesting this information to gain a better understanding of costs associated with digital acquisition and be able to prepare more accurate price estimates so that future digital acquisition will be adequately planned for and funded.

B.  BACKGROUND
APFO is responsible for contracting and administering USDA "Resource Projects," including those for the U.S. Forest Service and other government agencies.  Historically, resource photography has been strictly aerial film acquisition in stereo triplets and when needed, scanned and then orthorectified.  Resource imagery is typically used for such things as vegetation mapping, resource inventory, land use management and planning, fire assessment, etc.  Characteristically resource projects are forested areas with high elevation and steep terrain.  The area size of past projects have ranged from 50 to 6,000 square miles.

Customer requirements appear to be steering the direction of the aerial photography industry to direct digital acquisition, therefore the Government must be prepared for and respond to this transition.  In preparation, and in order to maintain a high level of service to our customers, the Government seeks information and feedback.  Such feedback and information serves to foster our relationship with our contractors and customers.  

C.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The Government is soliciting responses from industry, academia, and the public regarding costs associated with direct digital acquisition of "Resource" (U.S. Forest Service) type aerial photography projects.  Please respond to the questions listed below by using the following project parameters and ground rules:

Project Parameters:  Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming, 5,374 sq miles (see attached shapefile).  Acquisition Requirements: Leaf-on, June - August flying season, 45 degrees minimum sun angle.  Image Product:  4-band, 8-bit TIFFs (or GeoTIFFs), with FGDC compliant metadata.

Please note the Bridger Teton National Forest project is a hypothetical project for planning purpose only and was chosen as a representative resource project.  Resource projects in the western U.S. are typically in very mountainous areas with extreme terrain relief and in order to provide accurate price information for this fictional project, some preliminary flight planning may be required.  The U.S. Government does not expect to award this project as an actual contract.

Stereo Coverage:

Question 1:  What is the price (per square mile) for 12-in GSD stereo coverage?  What assumptions were made that could impact price (i.e. side/overlap)?

Question 2:  What is an approximate increase/decrease in price if GSD requirement was changed to 6-in or 2-ft?  An approximate price factor is all that is needed.
		
Question 3:  Describe how you would be performing quality control on the digital product (i.e. how would you be inspecting the side/overlap)?

Question 4:  What file format (i.e. GeoTIFF, TIFF with world file, etc.) and geo-referencing (i.e. single point, etc) is your cost estimate based on?  Would you consider this a standard product for your current customers?

Upgrade to Ortho:

Question 5:  What would the approximate price increase be if an ortho product was also required?  What horizontal accuracy is this price estimate based on and what assumptions (i.e. tile size) did you make that could significantly impact the price estimate if changed?  What elevation model would be used and how many ground control points would be needed?

Question 6:  What data and in what format (i.e., post-processed ABGPS/IMU data) does the Government need delivered if the ortho product has been delayed or will be prepared by a third party?   An example would be if a regional forest office does not have enough money to buy an ortho product but wants the option to issue a secondary contract during the following fiscal year to have ortho products generated.

Additional Questions:

Question 7:  What would the price impact be if raw imagery (non-geoprocessed, uncompressed digital image files in a TIFF format) was a required deliverable?  

Question 8:  What impact to the Small Business Administration (SBA) small business size standards would moving to direct digital acquisition have on the aerial photography community?

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Reston, VA, has a requirement for scientific and engineering analyses to support the USGS responsibility for satellite spacecraft and ground systems.  The USGS must be provided with timely, objective and non-advocacy input to plan, execute and evaluate system procurements and operational satellite anomalies.  A unique requirement of this effort is that is must be conducted in an independent fashion with freedom from any bias that would result in predilection towards any particular hardware and/or software design or approach.  A demonstrated history of freedom from organizational conflict of interest in an essential requirement.  The highly technical nature of the support required by the USGS presents the need for access to a diversity of technical hardware, software, and operation skills, and to extensive databases and information sources.  The ability to obtain, integrate, and protect proprietary information from domestic, foreign, and international contractors without ear of disclosure is a requirement for anyone providing this support, due to the levels of proprietary information involved.  The capability and proven track record for successfully integrating and protecting proprietary information on multi-contractor programs is required.  Also required is extensive, detailed, previous experience in operational and follow-on satellite-based land remote sensing to provide the depth of expertise needed for mission support. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, The Government considers the item specified as a sole source from Aerospace Corporation, Arlington, VA, which has demonstrated such non-advocacy independence in forty years with USGS, NASA, and the Air Force.  The government proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item or its functional equivalent (based upon criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis to the Contracting Officer, Karen Phillips via email at kphillip@usgs.gov.  Phone requests will not be accepted.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists, therefore requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments' only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies.

BARDA's mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN).  As part of its CBRN development and preparedness mission, BARDA announces a program to encourage research and development aimed at MCMs specifically addressing the hematopoietic and vascular syndromes resulting from acute radiation exposure from potential terrorist acts with radioactive materials or nuclear weapons, or public health emergencies. 

BARDA is using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to advance the development of new CBRN therapeutics, including the development of new indications for already licensed therapeutics, as novel MCMs for the treatment of populations exposed to acute radiation as a result of a nuclear detonation, radiologic dispersive device (RDD, "dirty bomb"), or other radiologic mechanisms, including deliberate contamination.  The purpose of this BAA entitled, "Therapies for Hematopoietic Syndrome, Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Loss and Vascular Injury Resulting from Acute Exposure to Ionizing Radiation" is to fund advanced development for therapies to replenish hematopoietic lineages, recover bone marrow stromal loss, and treat vascular injuries.

It is the intention of this BAA to award contracts to provide funding for Offerors to advance lead candidate products in the development pipeline.  Each lead candidate product must be developed to serve as an MCM for injuries sustained from exposure to ionizing radiation.  Advanced development funding from BARDA shall assist selected candidate products through clinical Phase 2 and not higher.  The research and development areas that are to be funded through this BAA include the following: 
1) Research and Development Area 1: Development of MCMs that can replenish the normal hematopoietic profile following lethal hematopoietic dyscrasias from acute exposure to ionizing radiation; 
2) Research and Development Area 2: Development of MCMs to replenish bone marrow progenitor cells and the niche environment that together manifest normal functioning hematopoietic cell lineages following lethal hematopoietic dyscrasias from acute exposure to ionizing radiation; or 
3) Research and Development Area 3: Development of MCMs that address injury to the vascular system, including intimal integrity, macrophage repair mechanism, vascular leak, endothelial repair, or alteration of angiogenesis, in response to acute exposure to ionizing radiation.
 
The proposals must outline a well-defined product development plan in the Offeror's Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW must include completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial no later than three (3) years after contract award, unless Phase 1 is completed prior to contract award. This BAA will also support Phase 2 product development activities which further enable progress toward a biologic license application (BLA) or a new drug application (NDA).

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to three (3) years beginning on or about September 16, 2008.  BAA-BARDA-08-08 will be available electronically on or about March 6, 2008 and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities web site. 

Responses to the BAA Research and Development Areas will be due on or about April 17, 2008. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide numbered note 26.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: TITLE: F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program   This Notice of Contractual Action is a  Pre-Solicitation Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) 5.201 and 5.203(a).  The 912th AESG - F-15 Systems Group,  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio plans to issue Request for Proposal (RFP)  FA8634-08-R-2650 for the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Obsolescence  Program.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The anticipated RFP  release date is March 14, 2008.  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an  Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) program. The F-15 ESTS is an  Intermediate ? level support equipment system providing maintenance &  repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU). The system  consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary equipment,  and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations and the  depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill. The  station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to maintain  and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY09 unless known obsolescence  for a variety of component parts is not addressed.  The overarching  program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission Capable (NMC).  The program will accomplish this by replacing instruments contained within  the station that are projected to be obsolete over the next several years.  The Air Force does not have program authority to replace or redesign the  ESTS station.  The planned funding profile is as follows: FY09 - $13.11M,  FY10 - $10.88M, FY11 - $15.86M.  Interested parties may view and/or  download the full RFP by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities  (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  The ESTS Bidders  Library has been posted to the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS)  Website @https://www.fedteds.gov/ which provides a direct link to the RFP  in FedBizOpps.  All responsible small business sources may submit a  proposal which shall be considered.  Foreign participation is not  permitted at the prime contractor level.  Address issues, concerns, and  questions regarding this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Barry  Foster; E-Mail barry.foster@wpafb.af.mil.  An Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal  development phase of this acquisition.  You may refer them to the  Ombudsman if, after discussing them with the Contracting Officer, you feel  that you are not effectively communicating with the government. The  Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or  Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues,  disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government  personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict  confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not  participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection  process. The ASC Ombudsman is Karen Emery, ASC/CS, 1865 4th Street, Bldg  14, Room 203, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (Phone: 937-255-6356; E- Mail  karen.emery@wpafb.af.mil).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation (paper copy) will not be issued. Further, offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of amendments (if any) or other information pertaining to this solicitation.  

Solicitation FA8751-08-R-0011 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-23 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 20080124. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein.

This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside under NAICS code 334515 and small business size standard of 500 employees.

The contractor shall provide the following items on a firm fixed price basis:  

Item 1: Analog Signal Generator
Qty: 3
P/N: E8257D with Options
Manufacturer: Agilent
Description: Agilent E8257D Analog Signal Generator with options: 520, UNX, UNU, 1EA, 1E1, UNT, R-50C-011-3 and R-51B-001-3C, warranty included. The Generator operates over a frequency range of 250 kHz to 20 GHz. The key capabilities are the remote control capability, frequency range and the ability to serve as direct replacements in an existing test system (i.e. no integration effort required). 

Brand Name Justification: these items are required due to their compatibility with an existing test and measurement system (both hardware and software). The antenna measurement system at the AFRL Newport Research Site is a fully automated system. The major impact of procuring equipment, other than the Brand Name specified, is that an entire suite of software control programs would have to be rewritten, tested, and integrated into the test system. This would be extremely costly and time consuming. It would also negatively impact test schedules when ?non-standard? equipment has to be swapped in and out.
 
The required delivery date is 30 days after award. The place of delivery, acceptance, and FOB destination point is 148 Electronic Parkway, Rome New York 13441-4514.

Offerors shall provide at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Nov 2007), applies to this acquisition. Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are: 

(b) Written proposals are due at or before  3 PM EST Wednesday 05 March 2008.  Submit to:  AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Charlene Booth, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555 or by email to charlene.booth@rl.af.mil. Offerors are encouraged to submit their proposals using the SF 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items.

(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization - Pacific has a requirement for Cisco Switches and Dell Laptops.  Cisco equipment is required for full and compatibility and integration into a research and developmental network at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands, Hawaii.  Previous attempts to integrate Cisco, Nortel, Bay Networks, and Enterasys network equipment did not provide a usable network.  Interoperability issues between the listed manufacturers prevented reliable multicast and unicast traffic delivery.  The standardization of Cisco equipment is required to accommodate the varied types of experimentation performed.  Use of non-Cisco products has (based on previous tests) altered the anticipated or measured results of the experiments performed.  The equipment must be new with valid software licenses, maintenance, and warranties. Dell laptops are required for the following salient characteristics: 1) integrated RS-232 serial interface (9-pin); 2) integrated Smart Card; 3) easily removable primary hard drives (for switching between classified and unclassified networks); 4) integrated biometric fingerprint reader; 5) externally disabled (on/off switch) wireless network adapter; 6) Gigabit Ethernet interface; and 7) modular drive bay (floppy, DVD+/-RW, and secondary hard drive).  Peripherals from existing older Dell laptops will also be reutilized (docking stations, primary hard drives, modular drives, etc.).  The Dell laptops will be used for network monitoring and maintenance of classified and unclassified R&D networks at PMRF.
This procurement is a 100% Small Business set-aside.  All those interested should request a copy of the RFP by submitting an e-mail to the primary POC.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) carries out a variety of research, development, and applications-oriented activities in the generation of sensing systems, integrated optics and communication systems. The research, both theoretical and experimental, is concerned with discovering and understanding the basic principles and mechanisms involved in optical devices, materials and phenomena. This work statement describes research to develop and produce optical techniques which are the subject of certain key research projects at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington D.C. These research efforts include a number of inter-related tasks that vary in both their technical dimensions and deliverable products. However, several tasks may support the same mission and must be coordinated or interfaced. These tasks include device research and development. The uniqueness of necessary experimental equipment dictate that a major portion of the tasks be performed at the Naval Research Laboratory. These tasks will deal with a number of programs including fiber optic acoustic sensors, electro?magnetic sensors, fiber optic sensors for smart structures, chemical sensors, biological agent sensors, and high-speed optical modulators for sensing and communication links. The work will involve (a) field measurements and analysis of signatures, propagation effects, devices, and sensors, and (b) laboratory measurements and analysis of optical devices, systems and optical phenomena including development of detection algorithms and analysis of sensor characteristics/performance. In addition, the work will support the measurement programs by providing for the design and construction of electronic circuitry for control of optical systems. The work shall be performed at field sites in the US, at foreign sites, at sea, and at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC.
A detailed Statement of Work will be included in the solicitation when issued.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract is anticipated.  The period of performance for this effort will be a base year of twelve months, with four one-year options.  The anticipated level of effort is 124,800 hours for the base year and 124,800 hours for each option, if exercised. The incumbent contractor is SFA, Inc, 2200 Defense Highway, No. 405, Crofton, MD 21114. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.
Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS).  An original and three copies of the offerors proposal shall be received on or before the response date and time noted in the RFP. The package should be marked with the solicitation number, due date and time.  The U.S. Postal Service continues to irradiate letters, flats, Express and Priority Mail with stamps for postage and other packages with stamps for postage destined to government agencies in the ZIP Code ranges 202 through 205.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with The National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, to acquire the below listed services.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the only contractor capable of providing "an expert or neutral person for any current or anticipated litigation or dispute" as defined by FAR 6.302-3 (a)(2)(iii) for the required services.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services described below are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer.  Firms believing they can provide the required services must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 30 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 987-6646, Attention:  Brenda Karl.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number and identification of business size in accordance with the size standard for NAIC 541620 which is $6.5 million. Title of Project:  Best Practices for Shellfish Mariculture and a Scientific Review of Ecological Effects in Drake's Estero Description:  The work of this proposed contract action consists of two phases represented by two separate reports prepared by an independent scientific panel of experts.  The first report is an evaluation that establishes what is known or can reasonably be surmised of the ecological effects of the existing commercial mariculture operation on the Drake's Estero ecosystem and whether the National Park Service derived the correct conclusions from existing related scientific studies.   The second report, which is subject to funds availability, will assess the nature and degree to which commercial mariculture operations affect natural ecosystems more widely.  The reports must be independent analysis of existing research that is above reproach, and whose findings would be accepted without question and above dispute. Type of Procurement: A negotiated sole source cost reimburseable contract is anticipated.  Range: First Phase: $200,000-$250,000, Second Phase: $200,000-$250,000

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) plans to award a contract to Iridium for space situational awareness (SSA) analysis, not to exceed a period of performance from 1 April 2008 to 1 April 2009 (1 year).  Approximate value for this effort is estimated at $500K.

The intent is to award a sole source contract to Iridium under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  This SSA study contract will support the analysis of capabilities and concepts within the context of the Iridium satellite constellation and planned constellation replenishment.  The study will address Size Weight & Power (SWaP) factors for hosting secondary payloads and technical means to provide timely precision global SSA coverage with assured data distribution and handling.  The Iridium constellation represents the most likely implementation to meet the above stated requirements.

The Government believes Iridium is the only company capable of providing the government's requirement for analysis and data/information that describes the current approach and concept of operations of the Iridium satellite service, without interruption in schedule or service, due to their unique knowledge of the Iridium satellite.  Award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the requirement and substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror's experience and knowledge of the Iridium constellation and planned constellation replenishment.  To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have direct access and knowledge of the Iridium platform and full capabilities.  All interested parties must show capability to process and handle government equipment and information up to, and including SECRET.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: Ms. Kristy Kuhlman or e-mailed to kristy.kuhlman.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and received by 1:00 P.M, PST, on 05 March 2008.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541310 with the applicable size standard of $4.5M.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC's.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses should be capable of meeting the above requirements at the time of submitting SOC's.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations regarding this acquisition to the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of white papers or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting officer, Ms. Ann Birbeck (310) 535-2634.

<DESC>The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to Flagler Development Corporation.  The extension will be for 10,129 usable square feet/11,280 rentable square feet of fully serviced office space, and fifty-four (54) surface parking spaces for a term of twenty-four (24) months.

The Government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a competitive lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.  

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government's intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to: Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351. Any written comments are to be received within ten (10) days of the publication of this notice.

Responses are due by the close of business March 5, 2008.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure as a sole source the brand name Cytek xP5 Color Upgrade for 3-color Facscan, FlowJo Collector Edition Upgrade to Pentium Class PC, which includes installation and training.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, on March 5, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to: Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.

In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-80037-MM on all correspondence. 

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

CGH array analysis is an integral technique to the function of The Genetics Branch. By using CGH microarrays to analyze copy number alteration, The Genetics Branch is able to investigate the role that specific genes or groups of genes play to influence carcinogenesis and cancer progression in tumor and cancer cell line samples.  Current optical limits of the Agilent Microarray scanner prohibits scanning slide densities of greater that approximately 244,000 spots.  Release of higher density microarrays of up to 1,000,000 features is imminent and will require a hardware upgrade to take advantage of this higher density.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b) 

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:  
Agilent is the sole source of the scanner upgrade for the Agilent microarray scanner and is the sole source for installation of the hardware necessary for increasing resolution of our scanner to allow scanning and extracting 1,000,000 feature arrays.  Use of any other source for engineering or repair of this essential and sophisticated equipment would void our service contract and all future support of the equipment by Agilent.


The following salient characteristics apply:

-scans slides containing arrays of in-situ synthesized 60-mer oligos allowing profiling of whole genome-wide aberrations of 1, 2, 4, or 8 separate samples on a single chip.  

-dense placement of elements allows interrogation of the whole genome and produces a result file which is native to Agilent?s Feature Extraction software and can be directly analyzed in CGH Analytics software.

-resolution (greater than 1,000,000 elements) and sensitivity of design supporting Agilent?s online library of pre-qualified whole genome probe designs.

-This software is specific to the Agilent scanner and is the only program that will run on this equipment there is no other source in scanning our array slides.

<CONTACT>Dawn Caracci, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-965-9465, Fax 410-966-9310, Email dawn.caracci@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to enter into a sole source procurement with MAXIMUS, Inc., to maintain and update a Ticket Program Data Operations Center (TPDOC) for access and utilization by two (2) existing Ticket Program support contractors, Operations Support Manager (OSM), Contract No. SS00-05-60079, and Program Manager for Recruitment and Outreach (PMRO), Contract No. SS00-06-60017.  MAXIMUS is the only organization with the immediate system capability and familiarity with the Ticket Program requirements to provide the required services, and the MAXIMUS system (MAXSTAR) is the only system alternative available to SSA within the established timeframes for continuing support of and access by the OSM and the PMRO contractors to meet their respective contract requirements.  BACKGROUND: Since September 29, 2000, MAXIMUS has supported SSA's Ticket to Work Program by providing system access and support through an electronic information technology data base (MAXSTAR) proprietary to MAXIMUS.  MAXIMUS continues to provide services to SSA via its Ticket Program Data Operations Center Manager (TPDOCM) contract, SS00-05-60089, awarded to MAXIMUS on a sole source basis on September 28, 2005.  Currently, the TPDOCM maintains and updates the existing database and adjunct data bases, updates SSA files, and accepts data inputs, as well as provides the OSM and the PMRO contractors with necessary data base access and technical assistance.  SSA expects to build an Agency-owned, in-house data base to support Ticket Program operations, which will ultimately replace the existing database owned and maintained by MAXIMUS.  However, this new Agency-owned data base is not expected to be ready for full implementation for several years, requiring continued support by MAXIMUS for the immediate future. REQUIREMENTS: SSA plans to award a new five-year sole source TPDOC contract to MAXIMUS, Inc.  The TPDOCM shall continue to maintain and update the existing MAXSTAR data base and adjunct data bases, access and retrieve data from SSA control files, update SSA files, and accept data inputs, as well as provide the OSM and the PMRO contractors with necessary data base access and technical assistance until the SSA Agency-owned system achieves full functionality.  Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required herein should submit a capability statement to Dawn Caracci via email at dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked SSA-RFP-08-1052, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received in writing no later than March 6, 2008, 3:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a solicitation will be issued directly to MAXIMUS.  TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Reference Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Sole Source requirement to EADS North America Defense Company, 1616 North Ft Myer Dr, Suite 1500, Arlington, VA  22209-3100.  The Government has an urgent need to enhance the resistance of the UH-72A engines to the extreme dust and sand env ironmental conditions experienced in the deserts of the southwest and the sand associated with operations in the coastal southern regions of the United States.  These types of operation conditions were specifically excluded in the general Contractor Logist ics Support (CLS) environments as part of normal flight conducted in accordance with (IAW) OEM maintenance publications.

The EIBF Kit consists of a filter element (one per engine), an electrically actuated by-pass door, and modification to the intake cowling on each engine.  The Contractor shall provide maintenance and techn ical support in the retrofit of the EIBF Kit modification for sixteen (16) aircraft.  The Contractor shall install the EIBF Kit retrofit in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) process es and procedures.  The Contractor shall provide a return to service statement certifying the aircraft is fully mission capable (FMC) post retrofit.

The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has ch allenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requi res a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts  for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Bar racks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The prim ary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identifi ed as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) fo r an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training Co mplexes:<BR>AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas.

<DESC>The Northwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mis sion.  These A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part Subpart 36.6.  The majority of the work will be located within EPA Region 2 (which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and the Northwes tern Division (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts).  In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to as many as five unrestricted firms sharing $120 million in total contract capacity.<BR><BR>Contract Information: The Government intends to award up to five contracts from this announcement.  This announcement is open to all businesses, regardless of size. The period of performance for each contract will be one year, with four (4) one-year option periods.  It is antic ipated that the first contract will be awarded not earlier than April 2008. One or more months may elapse between subsequent contract awards.  Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period.  Task order assignments will be determi ned with consideration of each firms experience, qualifications, past performance, capability and capacity.  These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursement type orders.  No single task order will exceed $10 million or five years in  duration.  Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $120 million over the life of the contracts.  Large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan. The subcontracting goals for the Northwestern Division, which will be consid ered in the negotiation of the contracts, are:  at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Businesses (SB) which includes: at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Disadvantage Bu sinesses (SDB), at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HubZones, at least 3% of a contractors intended subcontr act amount to be placed with Veteran-owned, and at least .9% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330.  For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less.  More than one contract is being awarded for the same scope of work; however, under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.  Therefore, e ach selected firm will be afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders in excess of $3,000 except as provided by FAR 16.505(b)(2), using the following process.  When a requirement is identified the Government Project Delivery Team will firs t determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing remediation project.  Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study and then des ign.  If a follow-on requirement, every effort will be made to assign the task order to the original A-E as long as they have the capability to perform.  For new requirements, the project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be a ccomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursement task order.  The experience, qualifications, past performance, capability and capacity will be considered as well as how we are doing in m eeting our small business goals to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.  The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for one twelve-month base period; in addition there are provisions for four twelve-month option periods; if all options are exercised the length of the contract will be five years.  The period of performance for task  orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement, and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act, as amended 1965, is applicable to this solicitation and resulti ng contracts and will be incorporated into same.  Selections are expected to be made by 18 April 2008. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.  Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that cen tralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and previously found in solicitations.  Detailed information can be found in the Help section o f the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance.<BR><BR>Project Information:  Firms must be capable of performing work on  a wide variety of HTRW/ environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required.  A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for Superfund projects in EPA Region 2.  S pecific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order.  Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting.  Assignments will include, but not be limited to: site investigation s, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and othe r modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying  and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), and working on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental type projects, including radioactive and mixed wastes, ener gy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, use of recovered materials, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, habitat restoration and mitigation, and sites potentially contaminated with military munitions.  For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<BR><BR>Selection Criteria:  (A) Selection of as many as five unrestricted firms will be based on the following pr imary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firms team demonstrated during the past five (5) years in the broad range of environmental work required for this contract including (a) I nvestigation, planning, design, and construction phase services for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste cleanup projects.

EPA Region 2 Superfund projects will have greater importance; (b) Knowledge of and adherence to regulations and practices pertaining to hazardous waste sa mpling, handling, transportation and disposal including RCRA, CERCLA, CWA, TSCA, and NEPA.  Experience within EPA Region 2 jurisdiction will have greater importance; (c) Oversight of Remedial Investigation, Feasibility Study, Remedial Design, Remedial Acti on, and Long Term Response Action projects performed by other parties, in conformance to their respective consent decrees or administrative orders negotiated with EPA; (d) Demonstrated quality management procedures.  The effectiveness of the proposed proje ct team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will be considered within quality management.  Firms will be evaluated for the degree in which their team possesses experi ence and competence in these four areas (a through d, above).  The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of these areas; (2) Professional qualifications of firms staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract.  The education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience of personnel working together with key management and other technical personnel will be considered.  This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion below.  Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these primary disciplines, which are listed i n descending order of importance.  List professional registrations, if applicable, for the disciplines: (a) Environmental engineering; (b) Chemical process engineering; (c) Chemistry; (d) Risk Assessment; (e) Hydrogeology; (f) Civil Engineering; (g) Geotec hnical engineering; (h) Industrial hygiene; (i) Health physics; (j) Cost engineering; (k) Geology; (l) Archaeology; (m) Biology; (n) Mechanical engineering; (o) Electrical engineering; (p) Architecture/Landscape Planning; and (q) Structural Engineering; (3 ) Past performance on DOD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  ACASS is the primary source of information on past performance. ACASS will be queried for all firms submitting a propos al.  When deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sourc es, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from ACASS.  The board will consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing off ice, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance.  A firm that has earned excellent evaluations on recent DOD A-E contracts for similar projects will be ranked relatively high on past performance;  (4 ) Capacity.  The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines from the prime firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time; (5) Knowledge of the locality.  The board will evaluate a firm's familiarity with local conditions .  Examples include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the state and local regulatory agencies, geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispers ed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located in both EPA Region II and the USACE Northwestern Division.   (B) Secondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria wi ll only be used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary crite ria in the evaluation. The two secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance: (1) SB and SDB Participation. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions ( MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration. Larg e businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  For informational purposes, the small business size is defined by the limits of NAICS Code 5 41330. (2) Volume of DOD Contract Awards. The overall most highly qualified firms will not be rejected solely in the interest of equitable distribution of contracts. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, award dates and total negotiated fees f or any DOD contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. Please indicate all task orders and modifications awarded your firm by DOD agencies within the last twelve (12) months under an indefinite delivery type contract.  Indicate date of task orders  and fee for each.<BR> <BR>Submittal Requirements:  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies of SF330 (06/2004 edition) for the prime firm and all team consultants.  Include the firm's ACASS number in SF 330, Part I, Section B, Block 4.  Section H of the SF 330 is limited to twenty (20) pages with double-sided sheets counting as two pages.  For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. font.  A contract-specific Quality Control Pla n will be prepared and submitted by the A-E after contract award, but is not required with this submission.  Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal.  Submittals must be mailed or delivered to the following address not la ter than 21 March 2008, 2:00 p.m. local time: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Attn: CENWK-CT-H (Thomas), 757 Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106-2896.

The period of performance for Option 1, Percontee phase 2 is 400 calendar days after exercise of the option.

The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.  The Technical Evaluation Factors are:  

1.  EXPERIENCE . (1) The offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) bridge projects and (2) road projects, within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation.

2.  PAST PERFORMANCE. This factor considers the extent of the offeror's past performance with reference to such aspects as costs, timeliness, and technical success as part of the consideration.  

3.  KEY PERSONNEL. This factor considers the qualifications of the key personnel proposed by the offeror to execute the contract requirements for the positions proposed. 

4.  MANAGEMENT PLAN & SCHEDULE . This factor considers the plan being proposed by the offeror to execute the work contained in the contract drawings and specifications.  

5. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business, however this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  

6. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM: The Government will evaluate the means by which the Offeror shall promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program.  (As used herein, the term "registered apprenticeship program" is a program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Council under 29 CFR Part 29.)

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

<DESC>This is a modification to FEDBIZOPS solicitation number N69250-08-R-0302 dated 02 October 2008.  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans (SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) intends to issue a solicitation limited to educational institutions within 12 miles of the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA Facility, with graduate degree programs related to disciplines described below pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(a)(2)(iii) for advanced research and development projects. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA intends making a single award.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain analytical and technical support services from undergraduate and graduate students and faculty at a geographically local educational institution in support of Advanced Research and Development projects on behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana region.  The solicitation will result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for issuing firm fixed priced task orders.   On behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana and South Mississippi region, the winning contractor shall provide analytical and technical support services in the following disciplines:  Electronic, computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics  Computer Science and information systems  Mechanical engineering and fluid mechanics  Geospatial characterization  Data fusion  Acoustical communications  Industrial/organizational psychology  Modeling and Simulation Customers include, but are not limited to: SPAWARSYSCENNOLA; Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education Command; Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; Department of Navy Chief Information Office; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Finance Center. The contract will have a base year and four one year options.  The total estimated value of this contract, if all options are exercised, is estimated to be $48,500,000 using Navy Research and Development funds. FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) states that full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain essential engineering, research or development capabilities by an educational institution.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has determined that such criteria have been satisfied in this acquisition. As the Navy's center for personnel, pay and manpower systems, research, development, test and evaluation, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has a need to establish and maintain a pool (civilian employment and otherwise) of scientists and engineers interested and capable of maintaining systems critical to the Navy and other military customers.  In order to assist in maintaining this pool of capable scientists and engineers, it is essential that future scientists and engineers receive hands-on training and exposure to Navy RDT&E conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA in the disciplines identified above.  It is essential to the Navy, and particularly the activities receiving these services, to maintain a pool of interested and trained engineers and scientists. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA engineers and scientists attest to the impact predecessor contracts have had on the realization of this goal. Many students exposed to these activities via predecessor contracts returned to support these projects or related work either as contractor employees or directly via the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA' New Professional Program. Employing students specifically from academic institutions will address the essential need for innovation in current RDT&E projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA and with its customers.  The SPAWARSYSCENNOLA  recognizes the importance of scientific investigation through the strategic theme of Innovation. Educational institutions are uniquely positioned to assist SPAWARSYSCENNOLA by providing a source of new and innovative ideas borne of scientific investigation in a rigorous, unbiased academic environment. This procurement will assist in maintaining and providing an essential impartiality and currency in science and engineering services that can only be obtained from educational institutions. Theoretical analysis, exploratory studies and experimentation conducted by students of a relatively unbiased educational institution are potentially superior to that of a for-profit corporation, due to the educational institution's interest and dedication to pure research. For-profit corporations focus on direct economic profit-oriented goals, return on investments, and bottom-line profits as opposed to pure unbiased discovery research. The goals of educational institutions include scientific investigation for its own sake, with broad charters focused on learning and discovery of knowledge within a given area. Educational institutions can focus on investigation and learning for knowledge alone, regardless of any return on investment or practical use of the knowledge acquired. This focus, in turn, fosters innovation. It has been the experience of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA that educational institutions are able to support research and development projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA with a continuing infusion of the very latest academic concepts and ideas at a relatively low cost. Because the cost of employing students is relatively low in comparison to scientific staff from for-profit corporations, many budget constrained projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA would benefit with the participation of students. In many cases, the use of students is not just a cost effective means of stretching project dollars; rather, it is an essential means of accomplishing the mission because project budgets cannot accommodate more expensive labor costs. It should be noted that as SPAWARSYSCENNOLA projects directly benefit from the infusion of innovation and knowledge from an educational institution, there are other essential benefits from the relationship. In February 2006, the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a joint report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."  The report identified alarming trends in the state of American higher education in science and technology; for example:  In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in natural science or engineering.  In France, the figure is 47%; in China, 50%; in Singapore, 67%.  In the United States, the corresponding figure is 15%.  There has been a 20% decline in science and engineering doctorates awarded to US citizens or permanent residents between 1995 and 2004.  Estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, and information technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, or 4-year degrees vary. One estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, and information technologists with 4-year degrees, while the United States graduated about 140,000.  China graduated about 290,000 with 3-year degrees in those same fields, while the United States graduated about 85,000 with 2- to 3-year degrees.  Over the past 3 years alone, both China and India have doubled their production of 4-year degrees in engineering while the United States production of engineers is stagnant. Moreover, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has found that the New Orleans area currently has a shortage of experienced scientific and engineering personnel. This contract action is a counterweight to such trends.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA materially participates in multiple projects spanning a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines on behalf of numerous civilian and military agencies of the United States government and private industry concerns.  Much of the work conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA is exclusive to SPAWARSYSCENNOLA.  The unique challenges and opportunities associated with scientific investigation at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA are a significant inducement for students to continue their education in science and technology.  As an intention consequence, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA seeks to stimulates and maintain the availability of a critical workforce essential to its mission as a Navy's pre-eminent manpower, personnel and pay information technology support center. In sum, the SPAWARSYSCEN NOLA has a strong interest in establishing and maintaining essential basic engineering and research and development capabilities relevant to Navy applications and interests; therefore, competition shall be restricted to educational institutions within 12 miles of the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA facility.  The distance restriction is due to the need to closely oversee faculty and student activities, limit costs of contract oversight for travel and provide hands-on mentoring for the students in order to maintain the essential engineering, research and development capabilities vital to the accomplishment of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA missions

<DESC>The NIH Ethics Office is seeking an expert ethics consultant to assist the Ethics Office management in various ethics related functions.  The NIH Ethics Office is seeking small business concerns, including 8(a) small business and/or small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business and Service-disabled Veteran small business concerns with the capabilities to fulfill this requirement.  Ethics functions include ethics education, information distribution, documentation, verification, advisement, interpretation of standard of conduct statutes, regulations and policies, analysis, and application.  This vendor will be responsible for all ethics issues involving employees of the NIH Office of the Director, the NIH Ethics Community (Deputy Ethics Counselors, Ethics Coordinators, and employees at NIH, as needed.)  The vendor will provide training and educational materials for all IC ethic staffs for use by their employees, including resources for maintaining the New Employees Ethics Orientation Website and the NIH ethics Program Website. 
  The NIH Ethics Office requires professional assistance to provide NIH associates with ethics education, accurate advice on all related matters, and interpretation and/or application of federal conflict of interest standards.
  The ethics counsel will participate in the review of requests for official and other than official activities, awards, financial disclosure reports, waivers, authorization for certificates of divesture.  The ethics counsel will be responsible for reviewing federal financial disclosure reports (SF-278, OGE-450, and HHS-717-1 forms) and outside activity papers (HHS-520 and HHS-521 forms).  Reviews will verify technical accuracy, information completeness, and conflict of interest issues.
  The ethics expert will analyze and advise on questions and issues brought to the attention of the NIH Ethics Office and make recommendations to NIH Institutes and Centers ethic programs on technical and substantive matters.  Expertise in the use of The Ethics in Government Act, the Federal Criminal Conflict of Interest Statutes, the Hatch Act (political activity), the Procurement Integrity Act, and the Standard of Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch is mandatory.   This responsibility, also, extends to the rules involving initial appointment and recruitment of employees, ethics while holding position or office, and post-employment matters.   The vendor will advise on the receipt of gifts, awards, honorary degrees, and sponsored travel.    This professional will be involved in the finding and investigation of conflicting matters, their corrective actions, and referral of information to the Inspector General. The ethics expert will possess extensive knowledge of the mission, organization, and functions of NIH programs and the relationship of ethics considerations to the organization's ability to conduct research is needed. Expertise is needed in evaluating new ethics and other relevant legislation, regulations, and policies and their impact on NIH organizational goals and objectives, and applying that knowledge to develop NIH-wide policies and procedures. Vendor must have the ability to handle competing priorities of the NIH Ethics Office that encompass varying degrees of complexity, urgency, and importance.  The vendor must be able to adjust work priorities to meet changing needs and exercise confidentiality, tact, flexibility, and decisiveness in performing assignments. The vendor must have the ability to research background information and interpret opinions and policy decisions relative to ethics issues; determine the need for and design new methods and procedures to accomplish work more effectively. Judgments regarding relevant ethics or management policy/procedural interpretations are considered technically sound.

<DESC>?This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) business, and women-owned small business concerns) that are capable of performing the following requirements:?

Background:

A repository of human cells, selected for their possible aid in understanding the process of aging, was established by the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development in 1974. This repository came under the National Institute on Aging (NIA) control in 1976 and has since been expanded to include animal cultures as well as human. The repository has served the aging research community by providing investigators with cultures of high quality, well characterized and uncontaminated cell lines for studying the biology of aging. 

Project Purpose: 

The purpose of this acquisition is to continue the operation of the Aging Cell Repository which serves to facilitate gerontological research by providing high quality, uncontaminated, well characterized, clinically documented cell lines to investigators. This repository is, therefore, very important to NIA in meeting its program objectives.
The principal goals the Government hopes to achieve through this contract include: 1) collection of biological specimens from a broad spectrum of species, including humans and non human primates and other animal species, that exhibit some feature that makes them valuable for biogerontology research; 2) from these biological specimens, prepare cell cultures of high quality, i.e., uncontaminated, well characterized, and clinically documented; 3) store these cell cultures under very specialized conditions, i.e., in liquid nitrogen; 4) remove from storage, expand, and distribute to investigators upon request; and 5) facilitate and stimulate gerontological research that hopefully will lead to a better understanding of the process of aging.


Please Note:
Small Business Teaming is encouraged. 


Interested sources are required to send capability statements to the following not later than 03/27/2008, 3 PM, EST:

<SUBJECT>R -- OMB A-76 Competition for Admin. Support Services
<DESC>This public-private competition is being performed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), New Executive Office Building (NEOB), Room 9026, 725 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20503.  The cost of private sector performance will be determined based on market research conducted by Anthony J. McIntosh, U.S. Department of State, SA-6 - A/LM/AQM, Washington, DC 20522, on OMB's behalf.  

This notice constitutes OMB's formal announcement of a streamlined public-private competition for administrative support services.  Through this competition, which will be conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, OMB will determine whether it is more cost-effective to have these services performed by the government's Most Efficient Organization (MEO) or to instead have the work provided by the private sector.  The activities to be studied fall within function codes Y510 and D000 (Budget Execution Support Services and Administrative Support) on the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act inventory.  The manpower currently used to provide these activities is 19 FTEs.  The work is performed by employees at the GS-8 - GS-10 grade levels in the 303 job series.

 

This notice is not a solicitation.  It does not obligate the government to request offers or award a contract.  If the performance decision indicates that work should be performed by the private sector, OMB shall not convert work to private sector performance unless the conversion is based on acceptance of an offer in response to a solicitation from a contractor whose performance would be less costly to the agency by an amount that equals or exceeds 10 percent of the personnel-related costs associated with performance by OMB's MEO

A performance decision will be publicly announced not later than 135 days after the date of this announcement.  This will be the only notice prior to the announcement of the performance decision. 

OMB's Competitive Sourcing Official is Mr. Robert A. Burton.  The Agency Tender Official is Mr. Jim Jukes.  

Questions should be directed to Mr. Anthony J.McIntosh, Contracting Officer, U.S. Department of State, Phone: 703-875-4679, e-mail:  McIntoshAJ@state.gov

<SUBJECT>99 -- Planned USPTO Opportunities
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will be issuing several Requests for Proposals (RFP) for competitive procurements in the near future.  This synopsis is for information only and provides an outline of upcoming and potential future requirements of the USPTO.  The USPTO needs a portfolio of contracts that can provide the flexibility to fulfill the majority of its Information Technology (IT) services and needs.  All of the RFPs below will encompass the USPTO Chief Information Office Systems Development Life Cycle methodology and include common terms, conditions and provisions such as Certification and Accreditation and Earned Value Management.


1.	The USPTO intends to conduct a full and open competition for Infrastructure, Design, Engineering, Architecture, and Integration (IDEAI) requirements.  This competition is for services similar to that currently being performed under the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contracts with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), no. 50PAPT201006 and Project Performance Corporation (PPC) no. 50PAPT201026.  The USPTO anticipates making multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to both large and small business.  Any conflict of interest concerns will be addressed at the task order level.  Award is planned by 29 August 2008 to allow for a contract transition.

2.	To provide adequate time to conduct the IDEAI competitive procurement the USPTO intends to extend the current SETA contracts on a sole-source basis for six months, through 30 September 2008.

3.	The USPTO intends to conduct a 100% small business set-aside competitive procurement for Information Technology Operations and Maintenance (ITOM).  This competition is for services similar to that currently being performed under the Facilities Management and End User Support (FMEUS) contract no. 50PAPT201025, with Trawick and Associates, with the exception of the Help Desk services which are addressed in paragraph number 4 below.  It is anticipated that the resulting RFP will provide for the possibility of separate awards.  For example, individual awards may be made for tasks relating to Facilities Management and End-User Support.  Awards are planned on or before 30 June 2008.

4.	The USPTO intends to conduct a 100% small business set-aside competitive procurement for Help Desk Tier 1 services and Help Desk Tier 2 and 3 services.  This competition is for services similar to that currently being performed under the Facilities Management and End User Support (FMEUS) contract no. 50PAPT201025, with Trawick and Associates.  It is anticipated that Help Desk Tier 1 services will be awarded separately from Help Desk Tier 2 and 3.  It is also anticipated that the vendor awarded Help Desk Tier 1 services will be barred from award for Help Desk Tier 2 and 3 services and any resultant contract awards for the requirements as outlined in paragraph 3 above, due to conflict of interest.  Awards are planned on or before 30 June 2008.

5.	The USPTO intends to conduct a full and open competitive procurement for Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V).  This competition is for services similar to that currently being performed under the Information Technology Product Assurance (ITPA) contract with SRA International Inc., (formerly Galaxy Scientific) Contract no. DOC50PAPT0401006.  The USPTO intends to make multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to both large and small business.  This contract will have a very strict conflict of interest clause and will prevent the awardees from being eligible for award of other IT contracts at the USPTO for the period of performance of the contract.  The specifics of the conflict of interest clause will be included in the solicitation.  The solicitation is not scheduled for release until late in FY 2008 with anticipated award in FY 2009.

6.	The USPTO is currently developing its acquisition strategy for Security Engineering, Certification and Accreditation and Continuous Monitoring of USPTO systems.  The solicitation is not scheduled for release until late in FY 2008 with anticipated award in FY 2009.

7.	Details as to evaluation criteria, teaming arrangement evaluation and subcontracting requirements will be provided in the individual solicitations.  

8.	Solicitations and information on any of the items contained in this notice will be available at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/upcomming_hom.htm.

<SUBJECT>D -- IT SUPPORT FOR AUTOMATED CONSULAR SYSTEMS
<DESC>The Department of State intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Harris Technical Services Corporation located at 7799 Leesburg Pike, Suite 700, Falls Church, VA 22043 for installation, support and training on various consular applications and hardware for both overseas and domestic users.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This action is being taken to provide for continuity of services upon the expiration of the current contract S-AQMPD-06-D-1184 which expires February 29, 2008 and will allow for the negotiation and award of the follow-on contract.  Use of another contractor during this period would result in the disruption of services and would necessitate costly start-up and transition costs to be repeated on award of the follow-on contract.  The contractor must support 3,100 domestic users, including Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) users in Washington, D.C. and system users in the Washington Passport Agency, Special Issuance Agency, National Passport Center, National Passport Information Center, and 16 passport agencies across the country and approximately 7,000 overseas users in over 220 overseas posts.  The contractor must have knowledge of CA proprietary systems as well as an understanding of the unique work environments of overseas posts and domestic CA users.  The contractor shall possess a Top Secret facility security clearance.  The estimated cost of this award is $34 million with a base period of performance of six months with three one-month option periods.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  This is for informational purposes only; please contact the primary point of contact on this announcement via e-mail to submit any inquiries.

VI. STATEMENT OF WORK

INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR DEAF COUNTERFEIT SPECIALIST 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Secret Service in Washington, D.C. has a deaf Counterfeit Specialist in need of a dedicated sign language interpreter to be on the premises on a full-time basis to meet the employee's communication needs.

OBJECTIVE

To procure the services of a contractor for interpreting services, to enable the U.S. Secret Service to provide effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and individuals within the Secret Service as well as individuals from external sources.

QUALIFICATIONS

Interpreters contracted to work for the U.S. Secret Service must be Qualified/Certified members in good standing with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID). These individuals must demonstrate high competence in and knowledge of ASL and transliteration. The contractor shall be able to understand, translate, and interpret technical terminology, laws, regulations, concepts, principles, practices, and procedures applicable to the Secret Service. Interpreting in legal or classified environments is highly desirable. Interpreters must possess knowledge of the Deaf Community and Deaf Culture. In addition, they must have obtained an education pertaining to the interpreting profession, and have a minimum of three years experience. 

The primary interpreter, and anyone backfilling in their absence during courtroom assignments, must be able to understand and interpret/translate legal terminology, and be qualified to perform in a courtroom setting.

Contractors must submit their resumes and a copy of RID certification with their proposal. Failure to submit these items will deem the contractor non-responsive and have the proposal rejected.

CLEARANCE

The interpreters must have a Top Secret security clearance.

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor will provide dedicated, on-call sign language interpreting services on Mondays through Fridays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for the deaf Counterfeit Specialist. The services provided will be professional in nature and will be in accordance with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf Code of Conduct. Under no circumstances will the interpreter represent the U.S. Secret Service or act as an official spokesperson on behalf of the agency.

In the event that the primary contractor is unable to perform as scheduled, the contractor shall arrange (in advance if possible) for a replacement interpreter, meeting the minimum requirements of the contract and possessing any clearances required for the assignment. This will include sick and vacation days. In such situations, payment of the replacement interpreter will be the responsibility of the contractor. The substituting interpreter must be RID certified and qualified. The Secret Service will not pay the contractor for Federal holidays that fall within their regular scheduled days, for days the Government closes for inclement weather, or for days that the deaf Counterfeit Specialist is on leave and the contractor has been provided a 48-hour notice. Some training/functions may require additional interpreters; however, notice will be given when there is a need.

Intermittent interpreting services may also be required from the contractor. Intermittent services are defined as services required in addition to the dedicated on-call position. The contractor shall provide interpreters who have appropriate clearances and qualifications, on an as-needed basis to satisfy this requirement. Examples of intermittent services include:
     Interpreting assignments that are expected to exceed the standard period that an interpreter works continuously without a team, and based upon professional discretion, the contractor shall consult with the Supervisory Counterfeit Specialist to determine if an additional interpreter is necessary.
       Other situations that require additional contracted personnel are those assignments that are two days or longer in duration (i.e. certain travel, instruction, training, conferences, and courtroom testimony).

The U.S. Government Standards of Conduct also applies.

The U.S. Secret Service will provide the necessary equipment and supplies needed for performance of duties.

MAJOR DUTIES

       Interpret effectively into English and ASL to facilitate effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and other individuals.
       Interpret in all settings where services are required. Possible settings may include training classes, presentations, courtrooms, one-on-one meetings with supervisors, managers and employees, staff meetings and interviews.
       Provide consultation to managers/supervisors concerning the profession of sign language interpreting.
       Maintain involvement in the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and other professionally related organizations and/or training programs.
       Work closely with the U.S. Secret Service Contracting Officer Technical Representative concerning scheduling and/or matters relating to the provisions for services at U.S. Secret Service.
       Maintain professional conduct, dress, and manner.

REQUESTS AND CANCELLATIONS

When possible, the schedule for daily interpreting services as well as preparation materials will be provided to the contractor in advance of the activity. Cancellation for daily on-call services as well as intermittent services will be provided to the contractor a minimum of 48 business hours in advance of the scheduled assignment.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

All documents (both hard and soft copy) that are produced during the duration of the contract by the contractor for the government shall be considered government property and shall be provided back to the government upon termination of the contract, or upon request.

GUIDELINES

Guidelines consist of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Code of Conduct, the operational policies of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, the regulations set forth in Sections 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. The contractor shall keep all documentation and information pertaining to the services they provide within the laws covering the Privacy Act, and shall consider all activity to be confidential in nature when servicing the Agency or individuals. 

TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS

The contractor will be required to provide interpreting services to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist located at U.S. Secret Service Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The contractor must be willing to travel to other sites within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as needed to include southern Maryland. Local travel, within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will be the responsibility of the contractor. 

The contractor shall be available for domestic and foreign travel with the deaf Counterfeit Specialist to provide interpreting services for meetings, presentations, training, conferences, and expert witness trial testimony. Travel will be arranged through invitational travel.

WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is performed in an office setting, laboratory, meeting room, classroom, courtroom, and/or auditorium. The demands of the services may require the contractor to provide long hours of service to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist, sometime standing without a break.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

BACKGROUND	
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States, most public-use aircraft accidents, and significant accidents in other modes of transportation (highway, marine, rail, and pipeline), to conduct special investigations and safety studies, and to issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.  The NTSB Training Center is a major initiative of the Safety Board to improve the training and skills of its own employees, and make its safety expertise and know-how more widely available to the transportation community.  In addition, the Training Center will foster an environment that encourages transportation safety initiatives and technical research; and promote uniform programs that ensure compassion, understanding and assistance for those affected by transportation tragedies.  Additional information about the NTSB and its Training Center can be found at www.ntsb.gov.

The NTSB Training Center completed its fourth full year at its new facility on the Ashburn, Virginia campus of The George Washington University in September 2007.  Training Center students come from accident investigation agencies around the world; past as well as potential future parties to NTSB investigations, such as equipment manufacturers and unions; disaster relief agencies, including the American Red Cross; and representatives from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.  

The courses are needed to ensure that NTSB investigators and support staff have the opportunity to continually develop and broaden the wide range of skills needed to maintain a high level of performance across the organization.  The following courses are typically offered 1-2 times per year:   

IM401A & B: Cognitive Interviewing (CI) & Advanced Cognitive Interviewing (ACI)
AS101:  Aircraft Accident Investigation

SCOPE OF WORK
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) requires development, production and presentation of teaching materials for the NTSB Cognitive Interviewing courses (IM401A & B).  The contractor shall instruct in training modules for the course procedures and techniques focused on transportation accident investigation.  

IM401A & B: Cognitive Interviewing Course Objectives:
This series is offered one-time per year but may be offered two times per year at the discretion of the government. The purpose of this course is to educate and train NTSB investigative personnel in the principles and practice of Cognitive interviewing so that they are able to best elicit critical and most accurate and detailed information from a variety of sources that are crucial to the success of the investigation.  

Day one of this course (Basic Cognitive Interviewing) should provide the foundational knowledge and skills needed to conduct interviews of participants in, and witnesses to, transportation incidents or accidents.  Emphasis must be on the cognitive interviewing technique to maximize the amount and quality of information obtained during investigative interviews.  

Day two of this course (Advanced Cognitive Interviewing) should provide an addition to the knowledge base and cognitive interviewing techniques covered in the basic course.  This program must focus on refining the CI confidence using the CI method through interactive discussion, demonstrations, and exercises.

Upon completion of this course, participants shall be able to use the Cognitive Interview (CI) method to obtain more accurate and complete information from eyewitnesses and critical personnel in accident investigations, explain how the social dynamics in an interview can affect its outcome, identify various errors of perception and memory, employ various techniques to enhance a witness? recall of an event, and brief colleagues about the interview process and its impact on the outcome of an investigation. 

This course will be given on two consecutive days, with at least 7 instructional contact hours per day. The date for this course is TBD but will probably be in February of 2009. The contractor shall be present during the entire timeframe of the course.

The proposed course outline is as follows:

DAY ONE (Basic)  (9:00am ? 5:00pm)

1.) Introduction 
2.) The Cognitive Interview               
3.) Social Dynamics
4.) Memory and Cognition
5.) Small Group Work

DAY TWO (Advanced)  (9:00am ? 5:00pm)

1.) Witness Questioning
2.) Practical Exercises
3.) Communication
4.) Sequencing of Interview
5.) Accident Case Studies 
6.) Post-Interview Assessment
7.) Practical Issues

The contractor shall provide the following coordination and instructional support:

Develop course content and materials.  Act as the authoritative source of information and developer for the course, including preparation of all instructional and student materials for the presentation of all the training modules.

The courses may also be of interest, and will be made available to other audiences that include, law enforcement, other federal agencies, NTSB partners in transportation accident investigations, and transportation professionals. 

The COTR will distribute and collect Course evaluations at the end of each course for students input.  The NTSB Training Center will review the evaluations and may require minor modifications to the course materials based on participant feedback. These evaluations will be used as the primary method to evaluate the quality of work provided by the instructors and contractors. Additionally, minor revisions to course materials may be required annually due to organizational change and/or new or changing operating procedures.

Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.    <BR>The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:        <BR>Factor 1: Conference Capability<BR>Factor 2: Past and Present Performance<BR>Factor 3: Price   <BR>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS FOR AWARD. Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal in importance and when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 3. The Government is interested in proposals that offer the best value in meeting the requirements with acceptable risk at a fair and reasonable price. In making the sources selecti on decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors.<BR><BR>FACTOR 1. CONFERENCE CAPABILITY. The following adjectival ratings will be used in evaluating the technical risk of each offeror's capability to host two-day conf erence per specific PWS requirements.<BR>      Excellent. The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includ es numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of  unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrat e a clear understanding of the requirements.(Risk Level: Very Low)<BR>      Good. The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions ar e further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements.(Risk Level: Low)<BR>      Acceptable. The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requir ements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable  performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported , and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements.(Risk Level: Moderate)<BR>      Marginal. The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance a nd advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions wh ich may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements.(Risk Level: High)<BR >      Susceptible to Being Made Acceptable. The proposal demonstrates an approach which, as initially proposed, cannot be rated Marginal because of error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) which are capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or re vision of the proposal. These solutions are further considered to reflect high to very high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements.(Risk Level: High to Ve ry High) <BR>(NOTE: A Susceptible rating cannot be a final rating. The final rating will either increase to a rating of Marginal or better or decrease to Unacceptable)<BR>      Unacceptable. The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high  risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantag es will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement.(Risk Level: Very High)<BR><BR>FACTOR 2.  PAST AND PRESENT PERFORMANCE. Performance Risk analysis provides insight into an offeror's probability of successful ly completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance record on recent, relevant, and similar contract efforts. The number and severity  of problems (if any), the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken (if required), and the overall performance record will be taken into consideration.<BR>      Excellent. Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform  the required effort based on their performance record.(Risk Level: Very Low)<BR>      Good. Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.(Risk Level: Low)<BR>      Adequate. Some doub t exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.(Risk Level: Moderate)<BR>      Marginal. Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their perfo rmance record.(Risk Level: High)<BR>      Poor. It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.(Risk Level: Very High)<BR>      Unknown. The offeror has little/no relevant past perf ormance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.(Risk Level: Unknown)<BR>Evaluation of past and present performance will be subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The currency, content, general trends , and relevance of the information in contractor's performance will be considered. Providing incorrect references and phone numbers may render your proposal as unacceptable.<BR>The government may also consider and use any additional information from its ow n files, references provided by the offeror, or from any source it deems appropriate. The Government may survey references to verify information provided and may survey other sources known to the Government.<BR>If adverse past and present performance infor mation is obtained, the respective POC will be contacted to obtain additional information about the circumstances surrounding the situation. Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past and present performance to which the o fferor has not had a previous opportunity to respond. The offeror's response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration. If an offeror does not have a past and present performance history relating to the solicitation, the offeror will not be evalua ted favorably or unfavorably, and a neutral rating will be given for this factor.<BR><BR>FACTOR 3. PRICE. Price analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offeror's proposal, but will not be scored. Pricing will be evaluated for realism and the extent  to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Government's requirements. The Government is interested in proposals that meet the requirements with acceptable risk, at a fair and reasonable price. <BR><BR>FAR AND DFARS PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES INCORPORA TED BY REFERENCE: 52.204-4, Printed or Copied-Double Sided on Recycled Paper, 52.212-1, Instructors to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, (Alternate I), 5 2.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -Commercial Items, and 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations, (Alternate I), 252-209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country, and 252.232.7010, Levies on Contract P ayments.
