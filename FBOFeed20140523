<DESC>This is a synopsis for a competitive services acquisition as required by FAR Part 5.2. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. VENDORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSALS UNTIL THE RFP IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Additionally, no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.
<p>The Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISRA) has been tasked to solicit for and award a project for the Seismic Station Mission Support (SSMS) project. A professional, multi-disciplined staff will be required to perform planning, management, support, maintenance, monitoring, and upgrade of three individual sites. The sites are known as Equipment Locations (EL) and are geographically dispersed in North America. The following specific ELs are to be supported by the SSMS effort: EL 079, Cambridge Bay, Canada; EL 244, Flin Flon, Canada; and EL 489, Pinedale Wy. Each of these ELs support AFTAC's mission to detect, locate, identify, assess, and report, in near-real-time, any nuclear detonation. The contractor shall provide monitoring support to AFTAC in achieving the goal of 98 percent of seismic data availability 365 days a year from each of the operational ELs. Additionally, the contractor shall provide maintenance support and sustainment to include daily upkeep of all aspects of the ELs previously mentioned. Due to the unique and highly specialized nature of the AFTAC systems and missions, a high level of coordination and technical expertise is critical. Finally, maintaining a professional working relationship with the host nation personnel at each EL is a paramount contract requirement.</p>
<p>SECURITY REQUIREMENT: The contractor shall lock all doors, windows, and any other access points when the site is unmanned. The contractor shall admit only authorized visitors. The COR will send an authorized access list for all assigned personnel, frequent visitors, and an access message for all infrequent visitors. The notification will indicate on the access message whether the visitor is to be escorted or unescorted. If visitor requires escort, contractor personnel shall escort visitors at all times when they are in the station. Visitors who do not require escorting may be given access codes to the facility if it is required for the performance of their duties; however, the access code shall be changed within 24 hours after departure of the visitors to preclude reentry. Further, for Pinedale, WY, the contractor shall require a current US Secret security clearance for key management personnel, along with all personnel assigned to Pinedale facilities. Program access is limited to "need-to-know" and individuals shall possess the appropriate clearance, program access, and United States citizenship. Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification (DD254) compliance is mandatory, and will be incorporated as part of the resulting contract.<br /><br />This acquisition will be conducted as a competitive 8(a) set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 Engineering Services and the size standard is $14M. The RFP will be available electronically on this website only on or about&nbsp;09&nbsp;June 2014. Fax, telephone, written, or email requests for the solicitation package will not be honored. Contract award is anticipated for October 2014. A one year base contract with four (4) one year options is being contemplated. It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded using Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) CLINs with cost reimbursement line items for sustainment parts. Potential contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award (see https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM ). It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in SAM by calling Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 1-800-234-3867. All responsible sources may submit a proposal (after issuance of the RFP) and shall be considered for contract award. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must be an 8(a) firm.</p>

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><strong>Background<br /></strong>The National Assessment Governing Board (hereafter referred to as Governing Board) is an independent, bipartisan Board that sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as The Nation's Report Card. NAEP makes objective information on student performance available to policymakers and the public at the national, state, and local levels. It has served an important role in evaluating the condition and progress of American education.<br /><br />Created by Congress in 1988, the Governing Board is made up of 26 members, including governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators and researchers, business representatives, and members of the general public. More information on the Governing Board and its work is available at www.nagb.gov. <br /><br /><strong>NAEP 12th Grade Preparedness Research<br /></strong>For the past decade the National Assessment Governing Board has been working to strengthen the 12th grade National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and study its potential for use as an indicator of whether students are academically prepared for education and job training opportunities after high school.&nbsp;One of the five preparedness research areas&nbsp;involves content comparisons and alignment between NAEP and widely used examinations for college admissions, post-secondary course placement, and workplace skills.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The content comparison or alignment studies compare NAEP to other relevant assessments, such as those that measure academic preparedness for college and job-related skills. These serve as the foundation for most of the Board's preparedness research, especially for the statistical relationship studies, which link NAEP to other tests and data. The content comparisons provide a basis for statements about what NAEP scores may indicate about the knowledge and skills that represent academic preparedness for freshman college coursework or job training programs. More information on this work can be found at http://www.nagb.gov/what-we-do/preparedness-research/types-of-research/content-alignment.html<br /><strong><br />Requirements<br /></strong>The Governing Board is seeking a contractor to conduct content alignment studies for the Grade 8 NAEP in reading and in mathematics with the EXPLORE in these subjects. The purpose of content alignment studies is to evaluate the extent to which the grade 8 NAEP is aligned in content and complexity with the comparable subject tests, i.e., reading and mathematics, in the EXPLORE, administered by ACT.<br /><br />The content alignment studies will inform interpretations from statistical linking studies of NAEP and EXPLORE in grade 8 reading and mathematics, currently underway. A total of two alignment studies will be implemented: one for reading and one for mathematics. A content alignment design based on Webb methodology will be utilized to guide development and implementation of the procedure, and that design is to be used for developing the proposal and for implementing the studies. This design is available on the Governing Board website at: http://www.nagb.org/content/nagb/assets/documents/what-we-do/preparedness-research/content-alignment/assessment-content-comparison-methodology-for-alignment-studies.pdf.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Request for Proposals<br /></strong>The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued under full and open competition, no later than 30 days from this notice. Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the RFP is released. The award is anticipated to be a hybrid type contract with labor costs awarded on a Firm Fixed Price Basis and Other Direct Costs awarded on a cost reimbursement basis.&nbsp;Certified Cost and Pricing data will be required for RFP submissions. The work will require close coordination with ACT, NCES/NAEP, and NAGB staff.<br /><br />The period of performance is anticipated to be approximately 12 months. This is a new procurement; there is no incumbent. The contract award is projected to be made prior to September 30, 2014.
<p>All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice, provide capability statements (not exceeding 2 pages), and submit feedback on the proposed solicitation. All timely responses received shall be considered by the Governing Board. Information on the Governing Board's 12th Grade Preparedness Research work can be found at <a href="http://www.nagb.gov/what-we-do/preparedness-research.html">http://www.nagb.gov/what-we-do/preparedness-research.html</a>.<br /><br />Questions and comments on this notice may be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, June 6, 10:00 a.m. EST at Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov. Responses will be posted approximately five working days after receipt.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management, on behalf of the Materials Measurement Science Division, intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oregon, under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) - only one responsible source - for FEI Modular Automated Processing System (MAPS) software. The Contractor is to provide the software, software installation, and on-site software training at NIST Gaithersburg.<br /><br />The Materials Measurement Science Division of the Material Measurement Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology focuses on providing research, reference materials, and data to support accurate and selective analysis of microscopic particles and surfaces. Nanoscale imaging and microanalysis of materials is one of the Materials Measurement Science Division's primary research topics. One of the fundamental tools to support this mission is a Helios NanoLab 650 Focused Ion Beam (FIB) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice:
<p>The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to issue a solicitation on or about June 9, 2014 for performance of the work described below.</p>
<p>Electronic documents will be made available free of charge with the solicitation on www.fbo.gov. Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive procedures and is a commercial service.</p>
<p>The proposed NAICS code for this acquisition is 221310 Water supply and Irrigation Systems with a size standard of $25.5 Million.</p>
<p>Facilities to be operated include the Elwha Water Treatment Plant (EWTP), Elwha Surface Water Intake (ESWI), Temporary Diversion Pumping Facility (TDPF), and Nippon Paper Industries Chemical Feed System (NPI-CFS).</p>
<p>The EWTP is designed to treat water supplied by the ESWI or TDPF for use in industrial, municipal, and fisheries applications by removing suspended sediments. NPI-CFS is designed to remove soluble iron and manganese from EWTP treated water being supplied to the Nippon Paper Industries Mill (NPI). Operation of the EWTP will be required to satisfy daily demands of the City of Port Angeles, the Nippon Paper Industries Mill, Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife Elwha River fish rearing facility, and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribal fish hatchery.</p>
<p>The ETWP is designed for a maximum treated water capacity of 37,000 GPM (54 million gallons/day or MGD). EWTP consists of an influent pump station, influent/chemical mix tanks, sedimentation tanks, chemical feed and storage building, effluent flow distribution structure, slurry pump stations, office/laboratory building and associated pipelines. The plant has been, and will continue to be, operated during periods of high sediment release resulting from the removal of the Elwha Dam and the Glines Canyon Dam.</p>
<p>The ESWI includes a concrete control weir, intake structure, supplemental diversion pump structure, fish screen structure; tunnel; piping; electrical; mechanical; utilities and site work. Mechanical systems include numerous control gates and valves, as well as fish screen cleaning equipment. The electrical system includes a standby generator and SCADA control for monitoring and operating project equipment. Most of the equipment will have several modes of operation: manual, automated, and remote.</p>
<p>The TDPF includes five 250 hp, 8,000 gpm solids-handling water pumps, a 250 hp water circulation pump, 3,750-feet of HDPE pipeline, and assorted ancillary controls, instruments, and structures. The electrical system includes two standby generators and SCADA control for monitoring and operating project equipment. Most of the equipment will have several modes of operation: manual, automated, and remote. TDPF is designed to provide untreated river water to EWTP when high river sediment and turbidity levels prevent the use of the ESWI, a gravity fed intake system.</p>
<p>The new operations contractor will likely participate in the joint turnover from the previous operations contractor for a period after the date of the Notice-to-Proceed. Operation of the plant in the future may be periodic, depending on actual sediment releases. The operator will maintain the plant equipment during the shutdown period(s) and provide startup and shutdown as conditions dictate. During periods when sediment content exceeds the requirements, the contractor will provide all plant operations necessary to supply the required quantity of water at the quality necessary to meet existing agreements with the water users. The contractor will also provide periodic inspection and maintenance of the Area Flood Protection Levee, including the cleaning of associated culverts, maintenance of riprap, vegetation removal, and other items required by the Army Corps of Engineers maintenance plan. In addition, all cleaning services, grounds maintenance and snow removal of the all facilities and all portions of the project site is required.</p>
<p>Operation and maintenance of the water intake and treatment facilities includes 24/7 operation to guarantee water delivery to users. Water delivery must be continuous and cannot be interrupted.</p>
<p>The cost range for the project is from $2.25M - $2.6M per year. The estimated Period of Performance is from October 2014 - October 2019 including all options.</p>
<p>TYPE OF ACQUISITION: A negotiated firm-fixed price commercial contract is anticipated to be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability, past performance, subcontracting plan (if required) and price to determine the best value (trade-off process) to the government. The government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>SERVICES MAGNATUDE for this project is estimated to be between $2.25M and $2.6M per year. The contract period will be for a 1 year base contract and the possibility to extend the term of the contract by exercising options evaluated at the time of award if deemed to be beneficial to the Government. The contract will include 4 one year options periods. It is anticipated that the new contractor must have all qualifications and submittals turned in and ready to begin operation of the plant in October 2014. Proposal receipt date is anticipated to be 45 days after the issuance of the solicitation. Offers will be considered from all responsible and responsive businesses.</p>
<p>A preproposal conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held the week of June 16, 2014. Interested parties are urged to attend this meeting to ascertain existing work conditions. Actual detailed instruction for attending the preproposal conference, to include dates and registration procedures required to attend will be included in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>NSN 7R-5998-013454855-KH, REF NR EC-10001-1, QTY 5 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". Drawings not available.

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Region 3, intends to solicit proposals for construction services on five (5) electrical bus ducts at the George H. Fallon Federal Building located in Baltimore, MD.
<p>Performance Location:<br />Baltimore, MD.</p>
<p>General Description of Scope of Services:<br />This contract is to provide electrical construction services. The NAICS code for this procurement is 238210 (Electrical Contractors and other Wiring Installation Contractors).</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) will be soliciting proposals from small businesses for construction services including the demolition, removal and replacement of five (5) bus ducts (2W, 8W, 2E, 5E and 8E) that serve as the main source of electrical distribution within the George H. Fallon Federal Building located in Baltimore, MD. The bus ducts are original to the building which was constructed in 1967.  A 2009 study and 2010 electrical insulation resistance testing called for replacement of six of the bus ducts (5W, 8W, 2W, 8E, 2E and 5E).  Bus duct 5W was replaced in 2011.  This procurement intends to replace the remaining 5 bus ducts.  Requirements will include work on new electrical bus ducts, fire proofing, miscellaneous framing and supports, and removal of the existing bus ducts.</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price contract.  Per FAR 36.204, the magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000.000. Offerors will be required to provide a letter from their bonding company with their proposal submission demonstrating their bonding capacity for this project.  The period of performance for this project is 944 calendar days from date of award.</p>
<p>The contract will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm fixed price award to the offerors who provide the best value to the Government.  This procurement is set aside for competition among small businesses. Small businesses and all categories of small businesses (women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HubZone etc) are encouraged to participate.  The small business size-standard for this NAICS Code is $14,000,000.00.  Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals.  For this procurement, the combined technical evaluation factors are approximately equal to price.  The trade-off process under the best value approach will be used.  The technical evaluation factors are, in descending order of importance: 1. Management Plan, 2. Past Performance, and 3. Prior Experience.   The Government intends to award one contract to the firm offering the best value to the Government in October, 2014.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make award without discussion.  Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.<br /> <br />The solicitation package (including specifications, offer forms, clauses, and provisions) will only be available electronically on FedBizOpps.  It will be available on or after June 9, 2014.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for SAM is http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror.  The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>

The grid-based surface soil erosion capability will be based on the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM).  The grid-based erosion model requires commensurate surface hydrology capable of calculating the shear stress within each grid cell.  The existing ModClark transform method, while grid-based, is only quasi-distributed and cannot compute shear stress.  In order to support the development of the new erosion method, a new transform method will be created that can provide the required surface hydraulic information.  The new transform method will be based on the 2-D Diffusion Wave Routing method used in the HEC-RAS 2-D solver engine.  The previous work effort converted the RHEM source code to the Java language and implemented it as a beta version of RHEM in HEC-HMS.  The RHEM code will now be modified to work with the new 2-D Diffusion Wave Routing method. <br>  <br> The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 - Applications software programming services, custom computer, which has a size standard of Size Standard: $25,500,000.00 in annual receipts is applicable. The contract type will be a firm fixed price, performance-based contract, The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). <br> This is a sole source notice published for informational purposes only and not a request for competitive proposals. Therefore, no solicitation document exists for this requirement.

<p>11. Description of this Action: The Government is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement as part of a market research survey. This announcement is for information ONLY and will be used to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. Any information submitted will be utilized as part of furthering the Government's understanding of the market place and an offeror's capabilities and capacities.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Det 8 at Kirtland AFB, NM, Space Weather Center of Excellence Branch (RVBX) has a need for a contract and has been funded to conduct research on the ionosphere which entails making observations of the ionosphere at high spatial resolution. To accomplish this objective, AFRL requires access to an existing large receive array which can receive signals from a high frequency (HF) transmitter located at Kirtland AFB as the transmitted signals reflect off the overhead ionosphere. The receive array must therefore be located close enough to Kirtland AFB to observe the reflected rays at a maximum 30 degree zenith angle at a reference altitude of 250 km, which necessitates the array being within about 150 km of Kirtland AFB. For adequate resolution, the array must have a long baseline (100 m or more) and a large number of antenna elements (100 or more). The signals observed by the receive array must then be processed and analyzed with super-resolution or similar techniques to provide images of bottomside ionosphere structures with high spatial resolution. This information will enable development of new techniques for improved operation of military HF radio systems dependent on the ionosphere for propagation. <br />The anticipated period of performance is from August 2014 to August 2018. The AFRL cost estimate for this project is: Basic Effort $300, 000 for three years with two Options, each for $100,000 per year for a total of $500,000.00.</p>
<p>This NOCA is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the AFRL's Battlespace Environment Division (RVB) needs as further described below. <br /><br />12. Background. The Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Space Weather Center of Excellence Branch (RVBX) has been funded to conduct ionospheric research including radio imaging of the ionosphere with high spatial resolution. There are no previous contracts for this effort. This is part of a larger research effort to understand and mitigate effects of the ionosphere on radio systems. The project requires specific observations of the ionosphere over/near Kirtland AFB using established HF-band facilities to accurately determine ionospheric structure over a range of scale sizes.<br />13. Description of the Efforts Needed. The critical performance requirement for the research project is the capability to record reflections from ionospheric structures illuminated by the AFRL/RVBX ionosonde or other HF systems at Kirtland AFB, NM using an existing coherent receive array with at least 100 elements and baseline across the array of approximately 100 meters or more. The array must be able to view the ionosphere layer at a reference altitude of 250 km over Kirtland AFB with a maximum zenith angle of 30 degrees or less; this is equivalent to the array being located within ~150 km of Kirtland AFB. The array must be able to sample and record raw voltages on all antenna elements simultaneously for frequencies down to 5 MHz or lower. <br />The tasks for this project are below. <br />Task 1. Record reflections from ionospheric structures illuminated by the AFRL ionosonde or other HF systems at Kirtland AFB, NM with the existing coherent receive array. This will require close coordination with AFRL instrument operators regarding timing, frequency, and waveform of the transmitted signals, and may have to be performed at specific times of day depending on available frequencies and ionospheric conditions. The receiving array must have the ability to sample and record raw voltages on all antenna elements simultaneously for frequencies down to 5 MHz or lower. The experiments are anticipated to require approximately 100 hours, most likely 1 or 2 hours a day for several months.</p>
<p>Task 2. Develop, test, and implement super-resolution techniques on observations from the existing receive array to achieve imaging of at least 100 independent sources within realistically sized range and Doppler bins. Super-resolution or similar processing does not need to operate in real time but can be done in post-processing.</p>
<p>Task 3. Cooperate with AFRL researchers to analyze data from the array in conjunction with other ionospheric measurements from Kirtland AFB to determine ionospheric structure responsible for the observed reflections in at least the two horizontal dimensions. This will involve raytracing and propagation calculations, empirical ionospheric modeling, and comparison of multiple data sets from different instrument types to constrain the final solution. Publication of results in scientific journals is expected.</p>
<p>Other requirements: The performer will collaborate closely with AFRL/RVB personnel located at Kirtland AFB. To maximize the potential for close interaction with Kirtland researchers, the performer will provide a graduate student or junior research scientist who can be located at Kirtland AFB up to half time, depending on budget, during the period of performance and a senior researcher who can be physically present at the Kirtland AFB location approximately one day a week. Working at Kirtland AFB requires that these researchers be US citizens. No budget for travel or relocation expenses to and from Kirtland AFB will be allowed. Changes to contractor personnel performing work at Kirtland AFB may be made after coordination with AFRL contract managers.</p>
<p>14. Period or Performance and Other Information. The period of performance for the above efforts are anticipated to be a total 60 months from award, with a basic effort of three years and two one year Options. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to UNM provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms.</p>
<p>Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A draft plan as well as resumes of key personnel must be included in the Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC shall include a program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Information should also include CAGE Code and current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) information, financial information, business size, and other information deemed relevant to being capable of satisfying the government's need.</p>
<p>Page limitation: The SOC is limited to a total of 25 pages and shall be single spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11-inch pages. Select an easy to read font no smaller than 12 pitch fixed or proportional font size 10 or larger. Smaller type may be used in figures and tables as long as it is clearly legible. The page limitation includes all information i.e., indices, photographs, foldouts (2 page), appendices, attachments, resumes, etc. Each printed side counts as one page. Blank pages, title pages, tables of content, lists, tabs or cover sheets are not included in the page count. The Government will not consider pages in excess of the limitation. <br />Submission: Submit the SOC with a cover letter, the original document, and one electronic CD-R copy. The electronic copy must be submitted on a compact disk (CD-R only) in a PC compatible file format and must be readable by Microsoft Office. Submit responses to either Mr. Francis M. Eggert or Ms. Nicole I. Canfield at the address listed below in the Contracting Points of Contact Information no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 12:00 p.m. Mountain daylight time. <br />No classified or sensitive information should be included in the response.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Belvoir Division (ACC-APG Belvoir) on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. Responders to this Request for Information (RFI) are asked to address the specific items of this notice as indicated in the following sections. <br> Background: <br> Certain classes of embedded computing problems significantly constrain Department of Defense (DOD) capabilities. Limitations on available compute resources, platform power, and associated size and weight, place restrictions on the types of solutions that can be applied to these problems. In general, if these problems could be solved faster, or with less power, then the defense of U.S national security would be materially improved. For purposes of this Request for Information (RFI), this processing is referred to as  quote mark Critical Resource Constrained Processing. quote mark  <br>  <br> The RDECOM CERDEC NVESD is working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and other Services to (a) establish a problem set for distribution to the research community representative of DOD relevant Critical Resource Constrained Processing, and (b) provide a rigorous means of evaluating and ranking, according to power and performance, proposed embedded solutions for this representative DOD problem set. The project, known as SEAK, will produce a suite of embedded applications and kernels that represent Critical Resource Constrained Processing domains of interest to the DOD embedded processing community, as well as a process for assessing proposed candidate solutions. <br>  <br> A key initial step in the SEAK project is to identify the processing workloads that, due to their complexity, whether computational, input-output (I/O), or bandwidth related, are not implementable within platform constraints using current (or even near-term) embedded processing approaches.  The SEAK program intends to formulate these workloads in a manner distributable to the research community and technology providers to support research and investigation to develop potential solution approaches.  The SEAK project encourages both hardware and software proposed solutions in support of the DOD critical resource constrained problems.  The SEAK program anticipates characterizing Critical Resource Constrained Processing in terms of the problem's target metrics such as performance, power, and reliability.  The purpose of this RFI is to establish dialog and solicit detailed information on workloads from DOD industrial partners in support of this activity.  <br>  <br> DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) is the Program Office that has overall responsibility for the SEAK project. PNNL is executing the SEAK technical effort, with advice and support from RDECOM CERDEC NVESD. <br>  <br> 2.  RFI Description. <br>  <br> DARPA, NVESD, and PNNL are specifically soliciting input to characterize DOD-relevant Critical Resource Constrained Processing embedded workloads with sufficient detail to permit PNNL to identify and classify key algorithms and kernels and to develop embedded Critical Resource Constrained Processing workloads for distribution to the research community and technology developers.  Information provided may include such information as data flows, sensor and data bandwidths, SWaP constraints (size, weight, and power), communications traffic, tasking, and other unique workload requirements as appropriate for a specific processing example provided and as typically found in constrained DOD embedded computing platforms. The SEAK program will distill these workloads into a publically releasable format suitable for wide distribution. <br>  <br> 3.  Submission Instructions: <br> All parties wishing to provide a response to this RFI are encouraged to contact one of the Government Points of Contact listed below.   <br> PNNL: Dr. Adolfy Hoisie, Adolfy.Hoisie@pnnl.gov <br> NVESD: Mr. John Hodapp, john.d.hodapp2.civ@mail.mil <br> DARPA: Dr. Joseph Cross, seak.rfi@darpa.mil <br> Additional information on SEAK, including information regarding response input format, points of contact, existing workloads and kernels, as well as other administrative and programmatic details, can be obtained via the following addresses: <br> http://hpc.pnnl.gov/projects/SEAK <br> Responders are encouraged to consider the sample response template, available via the indicated link above, as a guide. With advance coordination, the SEAK team may offer to visit interested parties as appropriate to facilitate information exchange in support of this effort. <br> We prefer that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, we recognize that proprietary data may be provided. If so, it is the responsibility of the party submitting data to clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. No Classified data shall be provided via non-secure channels. If classified information is to be provided (for example, to provide a general workload context), the interested party shall contact PNNL or NVESD for guidance and submission instructions. No classified or proprietary information shall be publically released under the SEAK program. <br> This request for information is intended to establish dialog and to request industry feedback; this is not a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses. <br>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command- White Sands Office, has requirement for Renewable Energy Systems and Associated Loads Maintenance and Repair Services for Directorate of Public Works (DPW) at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. Therefore, White Sands Missile Range will be hosting a one (1) day only Site Visit for the Renewable Energy Systems and Associated Loads Maintenance and Repair Services and invites you to attend. <br>  <br> Location: WSMR Professional Development Center, Classroom 131, Building 465, Dyer Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, 88002. Parking is available near the intersection of Dyer Street and Rock Island Avenue and also at Dyer Street and Picatinny Avenue. <br>  <br> Time: The site visit will begin at 08:00 AM on 12 June 2014. Attendees should plan on arriving to WSMR at least one and one half (1.5) hour prior to the site visit so you may process through security, obtain a visitor's pass and check-in at the event. Check-in at the site visit will begin at 07:30 AM MST.  <br> All questions will be held until after the site visit. All questions and answers discussed at the Site Visit will be published for all Small Business contractors via the FBO website. <br>  <br> RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Site Visit must RSVP to Ms. Bernadette Quevedo, Contract Specialist. Small Business contractors are limited to two (2) persons per contractor for the Site Visit. <br>  <br> No foreign nationals are permitted. The contractor must e-mail the completed attached RSVP form (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook) Ms. Bernadette Quevedo, Contract Specialist,  bernadette.t.quevedo.civ@mail.mil  by 04 June 2014 at 3:00 PM MST. Any response submitted after 04 June 2014 will not be accepted. Due to security procedures, the persons attending the Site Visit must be listed on the RSVP form.   <br>  <br> Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Site Visit. Please visit the WSMR website, http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx, for more information about WSMR. The  quote mark WSMR at a Glance 2011 quote mark  and the WSMR Fact-book quote mark  are also attached for your basic information. Maps of WSMR are available at: <br> http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx.  <br>  <br> Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile testing. Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed. <br>  <br> Installation Access: All visitors must bring photo identification. To obtain a vehicle security pass you must have a driver's license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance. All visitors must enter WSMR through the Las Cruces main gate (located off of US Highway 70). Visitors must stop at the WSMR Reception Center to obtain their visitor's pass. <br>  <br> Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx.  The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video. You will be asked to sign a form, acknowledging that you have viewed this video at the check-in event. No person will be allowed to tour the range without first viewing this video. <br>  <br> Photography & Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area. <br>  <br> A DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) with the Technical Exhibits has been provided for industry review and is subject to change prior to its official release.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small businesses.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />Background<br /><br /></strong></span>This Sources Sought Notice replaces the sources sought originally posted on August 13, 2013, (SS No. FDA-Off-Site-RIM-00014). This notice is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers.

FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully perform FDA's Off-Site Document Control Center requirements.
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information.

<p>Based on the responses received from this SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the FDA may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Single Hybrid Firm-Fixed-Price/Labor Hour/Time and Material Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for each task or a combination of tasks (refer to Statement of Work). The ID/IQ will have a one-year period of performance plus four one-year option periods. The maximum value of the ID/IQ is estimated to be $103 Million.

<p>A complete response to the sources sought should include answers to all of the questions below. Please note that a respondent's failure to provide a complete response to a question will be interpreted to mean that it does not understand the question and does not demonstrate the capability to provide services required. Responses should demonstrate capability (i.e. specific projects), not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g.: The response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can scan documents.").</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Questions:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. The attached draft SOW describes the following major tasks under which task orders may be released to obtain specific services related to FDA's offsite document control center. Please demonstrate your capability for each of the following task areas:</p>

<DESC>A market research is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of interested businesses that can meet the requirements proposed below. If your firm is capable of meeting the requested requirements and you are interested in this project please respond appropriately, negative responses are also encouraged. The proposed project is for the following:  <br>  <br> Both of the existing Kohler generators (Model #2000REOZDB) will need to be disconnected from the existing paralleling switchgear and connected to the new paralleling gear. The DEC-550 controls are in the generator enclosures with each generator, and the controls in the switchgear are primarily Modicon Momentum PLC's. The existing switchgear will be kept in service and will be used for the utility point of common coupling and to connect to the new generator paralleling switchgear and the protected load. <br>  <br> The successful Contractor will need to provide all necessary equipment, programming, startup, and training services to provide a complete system with the following functions:   <br>  <br> Utility Connected Operation - protected load served by utility feed only.  Both utility and load breakers are to remain in the existing switchgear <br>  <br> Generator Connected Operation - protected load served by new and existing generators connected to new paralleling gear with load breakers remaining in existing switchgear (via tie between new and existing switchgear) <br>  <br> Closed Transition Between Utility and Generator Connected Operation - the system shall provide a synchronized closed transition between utility and islanded operation and between islanded and utility operation. <br>  <br> Generator Test Mode - the new paralleling gear shall be provided with a breaker for a load bank to be connected.  The system shall allow the generators to be operated on the load bank completely isolated from the utility and load breakers in the existing switchgear. <br>  <br> Future Second Protected Load Feed - The paralleling gear shall be provided with a spare breaker for the purpose of supporting a future isolated load served by a second utility feeder.  This second system shall have all of the same features as the existing system.  It will not be necessary to interconnect both systems at the same time. <br>  <br> Due to the nature of the load being protected, minimal downtime and maximum reliability of the final system are required. The successful Contractor will need to complete all work associated with the reconnection of the system and its testing and startup in less than a week's time. <br>  <br>  <br> Submission Requirements: <br> 1)Documentation of product meeting the Buy American Act <br> 2)Document of the product meeting FAR Part 23.203 and Federal Energy Management Plan  <br>  <br> All interested contractors should respond to this survey by 9 June 2015 by 1400 hrs Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses to this announcement must be in writing. The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge of potential Contractors that are capable of providing these services.  
Network Contracting Office (NCO) 21 is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for providing residential placement and supportive services under the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program. This program has been developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in an effort to end veteran homelessness and is authorized by Public Law 112-37 (and previously Public Law 100-6) and 38 U.S.C 2031(b). The Department of Veterans Affairs Sierra Pacific Network desires to implement this program by obtaining Emergency Housing Services for homeless or near homeless Veterans, preparing them for independent living so that they eventually find their way to permanent housing located within the community. 
The purpose of this announcement is to obtain information from Contractors within the Department of Veterans Affairs Sierra Pacific Network located in Reno, NV area who can provide housing, care, treatment, and rehabilitative services to homeless veterans with medical, mental health or co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders in a community-based residential treatment facility.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.205(c) and 15.201, this RFI seeks information from potential Offerors applicable to CMS' upcoming Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) solicitations: A/B Jurisdiction M (formerly Jurisdiction 11), DME Jurisdiction B, A/B Jurisdiction 15, DME Jurisdiction D, and DME Jurisdiction A. CMS anticipates an additional three MAC RFPs in 2015. <br /><br />In order to more effectively and efficiently evaluate Offeror's technical and business proposals submitted in response to MAC solicitations, CMS has drafted changes to its Request for Proposal (RFP) Technical and Business Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Criteria. Specifically, CMS has made changes to solicitation Section K (Representations, Certifications and other Statements of Offerors or Respondents), Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors or Respondents), Section M (Evaluation Factors for Award) and the Basis of Estimate (BOE) form.</p>
<p>The goal of this RFI is to obtain advance industry feedback on the clarity and efficacy of these draft RFP changes in advance of near-term MAC procurements. In this RFI, CMS desires to elicit and consider as many industry questions and viewpoints on the DRAFT revisions to the MAC RFP provisions (Sections K, L and M and BOE) as possible BEFORE release of the next MAC solicitation(s). Comments and questions received from potential Offerors may also merit additional changes to CMS' DRAFT RFP Sections K, L and M and the revised BOE, BEFORE release of the next MAC solicitation(s).</p>
<p>Potential Offerors are directed to the attached RFI for additional information, point of contact email address for responses and specific information requested.&nbsp;</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6230-00-NIB-0052<br />Name:		Flashlight, Tactical, Lithium-Ion Rechargeable, Multi-color LEDs<br />Description:	Lithium-ion rechargeable multi-color LEDs flashlight. Powered by two CR123 batteries and offers an LED + red and blue LEDs for multi-light functionality.  UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		6230-00-NIB-0053<br />Name:		Penlight, Tactical-Style, LED, 2 AAA, 5" Long<br />Description:	Tactical-style aircraft-aluminum penlight producing a brilliant 69 lumens of light for 3-4 hrs.  LED is powered by two AAA batteries. Features an aircraft-aluminum body which is virtually indestructible.  UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		6230-00-NIB-0054<br />Name:		Flashlight, Tactical-Style, LED, 2 AAA, 6" Long<br />Description:	Tactical-style aircraft-aluminum flashlight producing a brilliant 220 lumens of light while providing 90 minutes of runtime on high and 57 hours on low, plus 2.5 hours on strobe. LED is powered by two AAA batteries. Features a aircraft-aluminum body which is virtually indestructible.  UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			6230-00-NIB-0052<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>NSN:			6230-00-NIB-0053<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>NSN:			6230-00-NIB-0054<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 9, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements, the USDA Forest Service intends to award a sole source purchase order to MALA Geoscience USA, Inc. for RAMAC<sup>TM</sup>/GPR System RTA Antenna sets. No award will be made on the basis of quotations or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purpose only.

<p>Certification Requirements:<br />The Professional Explorer GPR system includes a state-of-the-art control unit and XV11 monitor, however the uniqueness of this system relates to the in-line, all-in-one, antenna design, which provides improved performance for deeper penetration. The antenna consist in a flexible "snake" like design that allows for the antenna to be maneuvered easily through the densest or most uneven of terrain without affecting ground contact, and therefore provides optimum results in the most difficult environments. <br />As a result, the RTA antennas are completely unique and one of a kind as is the overall Professional Explorer GPR system. Although other GPR manufacturers supply a wide variety of GPR technology including the most traditional shielded and unshielded antennas, no other supplier provides anything close to the design and versatility of the Mala RTAs. Since the primary purpose of purchasing a GPR unit includes remote terrains of difficult access, only the RTA antennas by Mala will provide the requirements needed to ensure data quality in such environments.</p>

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to modify contract SS00-10-60080 with Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. of Ashburn, Virginia on a sole source basis to add transportation services to the existing contract for a period of up to 6 months. The purpose of this contract is to provide off-site data storage and disaster recovery.
<p>SSA is currently in the process of building an additional data center, which is anticipated to be complete during the next and last final option period of this contract. It will be necessary to provide transportation services for pick-up and delivery of media to and from this site for up to the last 6 months of the option year. As the existing contractor, Iron Mountain is in a unique position to provide these services.</p>
<p>The last and final option period of this contract is from 8/1/2014-7/31/2015. During this option period, it is SSA's intent to compete a new contract, which will include transportation services that support the new data center. However, as mentioned, it will be necessary to provide support to this site during the final option year. As the ultimate goal of this contract is disaster recovery efforts, having more than one contractor handling media would place the agency at great risk of not being able to retrieve time sensitive data during a disaster. Additionally, Iron Mountain is currently providing all data storage services, which will not change, adding further confusion and risk if another contractor were to perform the transportation services only for the short period of time during this transition phase to and from the new site. As the existing contractor for both transportation services and offsite data storage, Iron Mountain is in a unique position to provide these services.</p>
<p>This procurement is being made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1)) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This is not a formal solicitation. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that the required capability is available from other sources and competition would be advantageous to the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement , proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. If no affirmative written response is received, the procurement will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address by 9:00 am EST, June 13, 2014: brenda.monch@ssa.gov.</p>

<p>This is not a request for quotation; rather, this posting constitutes SSA's notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis with GT Software, Inc. for the above specified requirement. SSA does not intend to pay for any information received. If SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing the software maintenance and relevant upgrades, then it will issue a sole source award to GT Software, Inc.</p>
<p>Interested vendors must submit responses to this notice by 1500 EST on 05/27/2014. SSA will not honor or acknowledge requests for copies of a solicitation. Oral communications are not acceptable.</p>

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractors unique qualifications:
Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA) is seeking the procurement of the E&E Publishing, LLC online copyrighted subscription service.  This subscription is a comprehensive site that provides daily current and relevant information on a host of topics including environmental and energy politics and policy of significant importance to the USGS scientific and administrative community.  This subscription includes all Science Centers within the Ecosystems Mission Area. As one of the preeminent scientific governmental organizations in the US, USGS EMA has a requirement to access real time political and policy discussions and decisions affecting environment and energy as they relate to our mission and the conduct of our work. USGS needs to know when EMAs issues are on the congressional agenda and who supports and opposes these issues. For instance, USGS needs to be able to identify committee schedules; access easy-to-read explanations of the content in appropriations bills; understand how key players are spinning our issues; receive clear, concise side-by-side analysis of major bills; get "Breaking News" alerts when there are important, timely developments; and see all the pieces in the environmental and energy political and policy picture. E & E Publishing, LLC, is the only service that provides real time (daily), congressional updates and comprehensive coverage of environmental and energy politics and policy, with an emphasis on application and how this will be affected by the current political atmosphere. They further provide time-saving analyses of how these discussions and votes will impact Federal agencies, the industries they regulate and specifically for the USGS, the anticipated actions and reactions from both industry and conservation organizations, including Federal, State and non-governmental conservation groups and organizations and what this means for the USGS ability to fulfill their mission.  Competition does not currently exist in the marketplace.  As this is anticipated to be an annual procurement, EMA will continue to monitor the market and future needs will be competed to the maximum extent practicable.

Extreme care and attention should be given to ensure that all necessary items are included in the proposal.  <br>  <br> L.1.1 CLAUSE FILL-INS:   Some clauses require the offeror to fill in information. Pay particular attention to 52.247-60 GUARANTEED SHIPPING CHARACTERISTICS and 52.246-4028 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE POINTS: ORIGIN as that information will be used by the Government to calculate transportation costs.  A completed copy of clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, must be included with your proposal. <br>  <br> L.2 TECHNICAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE (TIQ):  The offeror shall complete each section of the TIQ (Attachments 002, 004 and 006).  Failure to complete every section of the TIQ may render your offer ineligible for award.  <br>  <br> L.2.1 ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL CAPABILITY INFORMATION: In addition to completing the TIQs, the offeror shall support its responses by electronically submitting supporting documentation where indicated on the TIQ.   <br>  <br> L.3 CLIN STRUCTURE and PRICE INFORMATION: The offeror shall legibly fill-in, in U.S. Dollars, the Unit Price column and the total Amount column for all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA on Attachment 007. <br>  <br> SECTION-M EVALUATION: <br>  <br> M.1 BASIS Of AWARD:  The Government will award a single Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Pickup Trucks, Sport Utility Vehicles and 8-Passenger Van to the responsible offeror that is assessed as Acceptable in the Technical Capability Factor with the Lowest Total Evaluated Price.  <br>  <br> M.1.2 EVALUATION:  The evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.6 ( quote mark Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items quote mark ).  There are two factors:  (1) Price and (2) Technical Capability.  The Government intends to conduct a price evaluation, to include transportation costs, on all proposals.  The Government will then conduct a technical capability review of the lowest total evaluated price proposal.  If the lowest price proposal is determined to be Unacceptable, then the Government will conduct a technical capability review on the next lowest price proposal.  Unless the Government determines it is in its best interests to conduct discussions, the Government will follow this process until the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal is identified.      <br>  <br> M.1.3 TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FACTOR:  For an offeror to be eligible for award, its proposal must be assessed as Acceptable under each section of the Technical Information Questionnaire (TIQ) (Attachments 002, 004 and 006).  Offerors found to be Unacceptable under any section of the TIQ will not be considered for award.  To determine Acceptability,  <br>  <br> (1)	the Offeror's response must indicate it can meet each requirement on the TIQ; and <br>  <br> (2)	where supporting documentation is required, the Government will review the information submitted to confirm that the Offeror is capable of meeting the requirement.  <br>  <br> An Acceptable proposal is one which clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  An Unacceptable proposal is one which does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  <br> M.1.4 PRICE FACTOR:  The information submitted in response to Section L.3 will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of the offeror's total evaluated price.  A price is considered reasonable if it does not exceed what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.    The total evaluated price will consist of the total sum of all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA and the transportation costs as determined by the ACC-Warren Transportation Office for all FOB origin CLINs (base only). <br>  <br> M.1.5 DISCUSSIONS:  In accordance with FAR clause 52.212-1(g), the Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical capability standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  In addition, the Government reserves the right, without entering discussions, to request additional information necessary to support the offeror's price in order to determine price reasonableness. <br>  <br> Offers are due no later than 23 June 2014, 1600 local time Warren, MI. Quotations must be submitted electronically through the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website.  No phone calls or emailed quotations will be accepted.   <br>  <br>  <br>                     <br>                 <br>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Alcohol Prep Pads. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Alcohol Prep Pads products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Alcohol Prep Pads. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Alcohol Prep Pads will be established approximately October 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately November 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Alcohol Prep Pads. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Alcohol Prep Pads.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Alcohol Prep Pads. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $563,458.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of those three, two are clinically significant, accounting for 77.7% ($437,962.00) of the total volume ($563,458.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.

Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </span></strong></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective will be established approximately September 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately October 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Hypothermia Prevention Emergency Thermal Blanket-Reflective. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $115,652.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the two product groups, one represents the clinically significant product group for the QSL, accounting for 94.70% ($109,522.00) of the total volume in sales ($115,652.00), and is a requirement for addition to the QSL. The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p><br />252.232-2010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Request for Quotation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.

<p>The National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Child Care Subsidy Program (CCSP) will expand and enhance NIST's portfolio of family-friendly programs, which currently includes on-site child care centers, alternative work schedules, family-friendly leave and family medical leave. The direct financial benefit to staff would serve as an incentive for recruiting and retaining both lower salaried and entry-level administrative and technical staff.

<p>The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional and administrative services with respect to NIST's CCSP.</p>
<p>OPTION LINE ITEM<br />Line items 0002 and 0003 are option line items. Quoters must provide a firm-fixed price for both option line items. Prices for the option line items shall remain valid in accordance with the following:</p>

<p>Line Item 0003 - Option Period II - Two years from the date of award.</p>
<p>The period of performance for each option line item shall be one year from the date of exercise of option. The Government may exercise option line items, at its discretion, at the time of award, or any time prior to the expiration date of the period of performance of the base period and any subsequent option period. Options will be exercised by the issuance of a purchase order modification (Standard Form 30).</p>

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>Best Value, with the following criteria in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>Factor 1 <br />Technical Solution-the proposal will be evaluated on (1) how its technical capabilities can successfully support this requirement in a timely manner, (2) how well its proposed management reflects the understanding and approach to outcome-based contracting, (3) how well the staffing plan and proposed key personnel demonstrate that they can successfully perform the work of this project and (4) and the breadth of experience in the relevant areas realated to smart grid and cyber-physical systems.</p>
<p>Factor 2 <br />Past Performance- Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. NIST will consider the depth, breadth, and relevance the Offeror's experience of the Proposal. Past Performance will be evaluated and rated as Acceptable, Neutral or Unacceptable. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for who past performance is not available, the Offeror will receive a Neutral rating. NIST reserves the right to contact the references submitted by the Offeror as well as use any additional information it obtains as part of the evaluation process. References other than those identified by the offeror, such as references in Department of Defense's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), may be utilized by the Government with the information received used in the evaluation of the Offeror's past performance. Offerors who receive a neutral rating on past performance may still be rated overall technically acceptable for evaluation purposes.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price<br />The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the Offeror's proposed pricing over the life of the contract of each acceptable offer in relation to other acceptable offers. Evaluation of proposed pricing throughout the life of the contract shall not obligate the Government to issue order throughout the effective ordering periods.</p>
<p><br />All evaluation factors other than price both individual and when combined, are considered more important than price. However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of technical merit without concern of its price. The degree of importance of price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the proposals.</p>
<p>Note: FAR Clause 52.217-8 is included in the RFQ and will be in the subsequent award. As such, the Government will evaluate the pricing for the options period for award. The pricing that will be evaluated will be for the same amount as base period. This evaluation does not obligate the Government to actually exercise the option as in clause 52.217-8.</p>

<p>ORDERING PROCEDURES<br />ORDERING PROCEDURES UNDER MULTIPLE AWARD INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACTS</p>
<p>Individual task orders will be procured through competition among awardees.<br />Competition will be limited to awardees only.<br />This section sets procedures and criteria that will be used to provide multiple awardees<br />a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order issued under the resultant contract in accordance with FAR 16.505 Ordering.<br />(a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, for orders issued under multiple award IDIQ's, each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order in excess of $3,000.00.<br />Accelerated or streamlined procedures, such as e-mail or fax proposals will be utilized.<br />The Government need not contact each of the contract awardees before selecting a task order awardee if the Government has information available to ensure that each Contractor is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order.<br />(b) Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for each order in excess of $3,000.00 under multiple award IDIQs if the Government determines that:<br />(1) The agency's need for such supplies or services is of an urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;<br />(2) Only one Contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;<br />(3) The order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered on the original award.<br />(c) Ordering will take place through a competitive process. A request for quotation package will be forwarded to awardees via e-mail or fax. The following documents will be included in the request for quotation package:<br />(1) A complete statement of work including the required tasks, deliverables, period of performance, associated information or documentation, and name and contact information for the responsible Contract Specialist;<br />(2) The due date and time for quotations;<br />Written solicitations and required specifications will be sent via facsimile or e-mail to each awardee's Senior Program Manager.

It is the responsibility of each awardee to ensure that the complete quotation is submitted such that it is received timely by the Government. Late quotations, or portions thereof, will not be considered;<br />Upon receipt of the Request for Quotation Package, Contractors shall prepare a firm fixed-price quotation and submit that quotation to the Contract Specialist on or before the date and time specified in the RFQ;<br />The firm fixed-price quotation shall include all labor and other direct costs associated with the required work;<br />(d) All timely quotations will be reviewed by the Contract Specialist, the COR and/or other authorized NIST Technical Personnel. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, the Contracting Officer will enter into discussion with the offeror(s).<br />If discussions are conducted, the Contracting Officer will request a revised quotation.<br />Revised quotations will be re-evaluated by the COR and the Contracting Officer.<br />Awardees should submit their best quotation in responding to individual Requests for<br />Quotation, as the Government anticipates making awards without discussions.<br />Awardees are not obligated to submit quotes for all requirements. Failure to submit a quote for one RFQ and/or late submission of a quote for any given task order will not preclude an awardee from being considered for future task orders. The Government does expect the courtesy of a "No Quote" if an offeror chooses not to respond to any given RFQ. Multiple no quotes or late quotes will be considered during evaluation of offerors performance prior to the exercise of option periods.<br />(e) Award will be made to the Contractor submitting the quotation that represents the best value to the Government. While the Government anticipates awards being made a low price basis, the Government reserves the right to make award on a best value basis.<br />RFQs will identify evaluation factors for award and the criteria for best value.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NIHLM2014166 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees. This solicitation is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM), on behalf of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure a service agreement for custom designed software for submission and tracking of sequencing samples to the Genomics Core Lab.</p>
<p>The Genomics Core Lab provides next-generation sequencing services which is available to all intramural researchers. The Core has a requirement for a web-based laboratory information management system for sample submission and tracking. The web form serves two functions - for end users to submit sample data, and for super user to track sample data and generate reports. The database would also incorporate legacy sample data for tracking.</p>
<p>The software must offer the following functions:<br />1. An intranet-accessible web form for end users to submit NGS sample data, individually or in bulk. Depending upon the field type, data will be auto-populated, constrained via validation criteria or pull-down menus, and/or entered as free text.<br />2. Local access by Core staff to manage user accounts and sample data, and to track samples through the sequencing workflow.<br />3. The ability to generate various reports specified by Core staff.<br />4. The ability to integrate legacy sample data into the database.<br />5. The software/database must be hosted locally and administered by Core staff.<br />6. Pricing includes training for Core staff in software/database administration.</p>
<p><br />Standard end-user functions:<br />1. Log in to website<br />2. Specify individual or bulk submission<br />3. Enter data for one or more samples<br />4. Edit data if necessary<br />5. Submit form<br />6. Log out<br />7. Email alert sent to super user</p>
<p>Super user functions:<br />1. Log in to website<br />2. Search data by one or more criteria<br />3. Select one or more sample entries for report(s)<br />4. Edit end user data if needed<br />5. Enter additional data for report(s)<br />6. Generate report(s)<br />7. Log out</p>
<p>Additional Information:<br />The system will be hosted on a Dell server (eight cores, 16 GB RAM, 10 TB storage).<br />The operating system is CentOS v6.4. The database platform is MySQL.<br />Currently, at least three types of reports are envisioned.<br />Login accounts and passwords will be managed locally, but the server will be accessible only within the campus intranet to maintain security.<br />The system will be hosted physically, not virtually (see above for server specs).<br />The system is existing (see above for specs).<br />The end user population for sample submission is currently ~150, but potentially expandable to the intramural research community (1000s).

B.	EVALUATION PROCESS:
1. 	Offers will be evaluated against the factors set forth in this Section.
2.	Offers will receive a preliminary review to determine whether the proposal contains sufficient information, as required in the OFFERER INSTRUCTIONS, to allow the Government to perform a meaningful evaluation.  If the results of this preliminary review indicate that the offer lacks sufficient information to allow a meaningful evaluation to be conducted, the NPS may eliminate the proposal from further evaluation and consideration for award.

4.	The Government may elect to accept other than the lowest priced proposal when the perceived benefits of a higher priced proposal merit the additional cost.   
C.	EVALUATION FACTORS:  The factors to be evaluated are as follows:

The software must allow for verbal interaction with the simulation to improve verbal de-escalation tactics.  It must have an instructor control station, a display and an audio system integrated into the system. The system must be able to support the addition of the AR15 weapons platforms wirelessly as a future addition as they are approved VA Law Enforcement weapons systems.

If offering an "or equal item", please provide specifications, pictures, cut sheets, etc.

Staff expectations after using:  As Police Officers, our staff are required to respond and react to deadly force situations at a moment's notice without warning.  This training system will put them through simulated situation that recreate these scenarios in a safe environment for learning.  Anytime that force is used, the Department of Justice, the court can and will evaluate all of the training the Officer has received that caused them to make the decision that they did. It is common practice for Federal and Local Law Enforcement agencies to use training simulators, but it is imperative for court testimony purposes to use well known major manufacturers.  This will assist in defending the Department of Veterans Affairs in any liability issues that arise from the court proceedings.

E.	SOLICITATION  
Evaluation will be made based on lowest price technically acceptable.  Resulting award will be a firm-fixed price contract.

If incorporated by reference, see provision 52.252-1 herein for locations where full text can be found. <br>  <br> ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 <br>  <br> Paragraph (a) is hereby replaced with the following: <br>  <br> (a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation which offers the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote to the U.S. Government.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: <br> Factor I - Technical.  The vendor's quote shall show compliance with the salient characteristics in Addendum to 52.212-1. <br>  <br> The Government will use the following standards to rate Technical:  <br> (1) Acceptable - Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br>  <br> (2)  Unacceptable - Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government intends to make an award without conducting discussions.  After the initial evaluation of quotes is completed, if one or more quotes are rated Acceptable, the initial evaluation will become the final evaluation of quotes and award will be made without discussions to the lowest priced offeror.  If any salient characteristic is rated Unacceptable after the initial evaluation, the salient characteristic will be rated Unacceptable and the quote will no longer be considered for award.  If all quotes submitted result in an unacceptable salient characteristic then clarifications may be necessary.  The Government evaluation team will evaluate the offeror's response to the Government exchanges with offerors.  <br>  <br> FACTOR 2: PRICE. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on anticipated adequate price competition.  Once the technical factors are rated as acceptable, contract award will be made to the technically acceptable quoter with the lowest price. <br>  <br> (b) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.   <br>  <br>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Computer Intelligence Association (CIA), located in Potomac, MD for Adobe Creative Cloud site licenses via an Enterprise Term Licensing Agreement (ETLA) licensing structure offered to the Maryland Educational Enterprise Consortium (MEEC) member schools.<br />
<p><br />These site licenses will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training, equipment and resources for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.</p>
<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud for members of MEEC include access for USU faculty, staff and students to the latest Adobe creative applications and services as listed:</p>
<p>&bull;	Design Tools (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Extension Manager, Adobe InCopy, Adobe XI Pro); <br />&bull;	Web Tools (Adobe Dreamweaver Adobe Flash Professional, Adobe Flash Builder Premium Edition, Adobe Fireworks); <br />&bull;	Video and audio tools (Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Audition, Adobe SpeedGrade, Adobe Prelude, Adobe Encore, Adobe Media Encoder); <br />&bull;	Creative Cloud Exclusive (Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Adobe Muse, Adobe Edge Animate, Adobe Edge Inspect, Adobe Code Preview, Adobe Edge Reflow, Adobe Edge Web Fonts, Adobe Scout, Cloud Storage, Collaboration Tools).</p>
<p>This subscription also includes enterprise deployment tools, new features and upgrades as soon as the products become available.</p>
<p>USU's Adobe enterprise license covers campus installations and two work from home installations for faculty, staff and students.  Over 2,500 faculty, staff and students must be able to execute the mission of USU daily utilizing "standard" desktop software products for campus, personal and work at home use. To fulfill requirements to update all University wide Adobe software products, a site license is needed to apply designated software upgrades/patches across the network. There are no other vehicles that provide these products and services at the reduced academic pricing of $45 per seat.</p>
<p>MEEC selected Computer Intelligence Association (CIA) through a competitive bid process to sell Adobe Creative Cloud ETLAs to MEEC member schools in good standing.</p>
<p>MEEC is the only organization of its kind and membership in this organization enhances the mission of USUHS.  For these reasons MEEC's Adobe Creative Cloud reseller, CIA, is the only source reasonably available to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email to carolyn.randolph@usuhs.edu by 5:00 p.m. EST on 3 June 2014.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

SCOPE OF WORK AND GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR MEDPORTAL PHARMACY SOFTWARE INSTALLATION SERVICES

The Inpatient Pharmacy is a vital clinical service within the San Francisco VAMC to provide care for our veterans. This inventory management technology is a critical component for this service that must meet our clinicians' needs.  The value of our inventory is in excess of $500,000. Without inventory management software, our pharmacy staff is required to manually count drug inventory and maintain manual par levels of all drugs, which is a very laborious process.  Automation of the inventory process leads to a more efficient process where we only order products that need replenishment.
2.	Project Scope
The San Francisco VA Medical Center is looking to purchase professional services to allow for the software installation, system reconfiguration, and system training for MedPortal inventory management software in the Inpatient Pharmacy at the San Francisco VA Medical Center in San Francisco, CA.

If after-hour key service is needed, contact VA Police Dispatch at 415-221-4810, extension 2003.

8.	Work Hours:

Normal business hours are 7:30AM to 4:30PM Monday thru Friday excluding Federal Holidays.  Work completed outside this time must be requested through the COR.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price, Technical Capability, and Responsibility: Proposed quote will be evaluated for reasonableness using the price analysis techniques provided under FAR Part 13.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Interested parties that can respond to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation must provide evidence that they have a potential to meet the requirements as identified herein.

B.	DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS
Contractor shall furnish and deliver supplies as listed herein to the: 
Syracuse VA Medical Center
800 Irving Avenue
Syracuse, NY  13210

Staff expectations after using:  As Police Officers, our staff are required to respond and react to deadly force situations at a moment's notice without warning.  This training system will put them through simulated situation that recreate these scenarios in a safe environment for learning.  Anytime that force is used, the Department of Justice, the court can and will evaluate all of the training the Officer has received that caused them to make the decision that they did. It is common practice for Federal and Local Law Enforcement agencies to use training simulators, but it is imperative for court testimony purposes to use well known major manufacturers.  This will assist in defending the Department of Veterans Affairs in any liability issues that arise from the court proceedings.

Bare minimum equipment:  The system must be encased in a protective case for storage.  It must be portable and capable of being set up and used where and when space is available.  It must have an instructor control station, a display and an audio system integrated into the system.  It must be capable of supporting multiple Officers training simultaneously in the same scenario.  It must have three SIG SAURER P229 wireless simulator firearms with the DAK trigger system.  Also, it must be able to support the addition of the AR15 weapons platforms wirelessly as a future addition as they are approved VA Law Enforcement weapons systems.  These simulated weapons must be within a 10% accuracy of the actual weapons system in both weight and center of gravity.  The software must have the capability to use less than lethal weapons systems such as OC spray and Baton strikes in the scenarios.  The software must include authoring capabilities which allow the firearms instructor to create agency specific scenarios and allow the instructor to designate specific hit areas on targets and scoring. The software must allow for verbal interaction with the simulation to improve verbal de-escalation tactics.

E.	SOLICITATION  
Evaluation will be made based on best value determination using the following criteria:  socioeconomic status, past performance, price and delivery schedule.  Socioeconomic status and past performance is significantly more important when compared to price.  Resulting award will be a firm-fixed price contract.

Hana Hip and Knee Arthroplasty and Orthopedic Table System:
The hana is a state of the art fracture table that optimizes the Anterior Approach to Total Hip Arthroplasty (AATHA). Its unique patient positioning capabilities enable the surgeon to replace the hip through a single incision, Anterior Approach without detachment of muscle from the pelvis or femur. The hana table allows for safe hyperextension, adduction and external rotation of the leg, incorporating the patented femoral lift and support system enhancing femoral exposure for improved component placement - a positioning option not possible with conventional surgery tables. The Anterior Approach to Total Hip Arthroplasty (AA THA) has become the procedure of choice for many surgeons and patients alike. Since 2005, the hana Orthopedic Table has been used to successfully position patients in thousands of these procedures. Knowing it is a vital instrument for the procedure, surgeons are reluctant to attempt the AA THA without a hana Table. The hana Table has proprietary and patented femoral hooks, in classic and tapered styles, designed to fit any size patient. The femoral lift system provides superior femoral canal exposure and access during AATHA cases, and provides aid during intertrochanteric fracture reduction and tibial nailings.  Additionally, the hana Table is surfaced with Tempur-Pedic padding to ensure the best in pressure management, minimizing the potential for decubitus wound formation.  The OSI Pro-FX Hip and Knee Arthoplasty Table is the only surgical table designed exclusively for hip and knee arthoplasty. This table was designed not only for anterior hip replacement surgery but also for spine and other orthopedic surgeries as well as cardiovascular surgeries.

<DESC>AMENNDMENT 1 - The Library of Congress intends to release the solicitation approximately May 23, 2014<br /><br />AMENNDMENT 2 - The Library of Congress intends to release the solicitation approximately May 30, 2014<br /><br />The Inspector General (IG) and the Assistant Inspector General Audits (AIGA) along with the consultation of senior Library officials prepare an annual audit plan. At times the IG and AIGA determine that certain projects on the annual audit plan require special subject matter expertise beyond resident OIG staff capabilities. In those cases OIG management will search out the required expertise to conduct the entire project through the Library's procurement function. Also for projects that the resident staff will conduct, audit senior staff determines staffing needs and at times will conclude that specialists and/or additional support staff will be required to successfully accomplish segments of the planned engagement. In those cases OIG will also obtain the required assistance through the Library's procurement function.
<p>The Library OIG plans to award IDIQ contracts to at least two qualified firms for IT Consulting services on a Task Order basis. OIG anticipates that the Task Order subject matter will involve an agency-wide range of information technology (IT) business issues such as (including but not limited to) IT: strategic planning, governance, management, operations, security, internal controls, hosting environments, applications, enterprise architecture, system conversions, information assurance, system life cycle development, web development, digitization, business solutions, continuity of pperations, cloud computing, virtualization, and best practices.</p>

<DESC><strong>UPDATE<br /><br />The response date is extended to 12:00 noon on December 9, 2013.&nbsp; Any questions pertaining to this sources sought should be submitted via email to Tania Gates at <a href="mailto:Tania.Gates@fda.hhs.gov">Tania.Gates@fda.hhs.gov</a> no later than 3:00 pm on December 4, 2013.&nbsp; No questions will be accepted after this time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice to Small Businesses<br /></span></strong><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from qualified small business concerns [8(a), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)]. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small businesses.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />Background<br /><br /></strong></span>This Sources Sought Notice replaces the sources sought originally posted on August 13, 2013, (SS No. FDA-Off-Site-RIM-00014). This notice is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this Source Sought is to help the FDA understand the market and technical solutions capable of providing the full range of services described in the draft SOW. FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully perform FDA's Off-Site Document Control Center requirements.
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's review of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this sources sought with any interested parties. However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the FDA may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Single Hybrid Firm-Fixed-Price/Labor Hour/Time and Material Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for each task or a combination of tasks (refer to Statement of Work). The ID/IQ will have a one-year period of performance plus four one-year option periods. The maximum value of the ID/IQ is estimated to be $103 Million. If at least two or more qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting) with a small business size standard of $14.0 million applies to this requirement. All documents applicable to this Sources Sought Notice have been submitted as attachments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p>Responses to the sources sought should not exceed 10 pages in length. They should be submitted via email to Tania Gates at tania.gates@fda.hhs.gov by <strong>12:00 noon on December 9, 2013. (UPDATED)</strong></p>
<p>A complete response to the sources sought should include answers to all of the questions below. Please note that a respondent's failure to provide a complete response to a question will be interpreted to mean that it does not understand the question and does not demonstrate the capability to provide services required. Responses should demonstrate capability (i.e. specific projects), not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g.: The response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can scan documents.").</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Questions:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. The attached draft SOW describes the following major tasks under which task orders may be released to obtain specific services related to FDA's offsite document control center. Please demonstrate your capability for each of the following task areas:</p>
<p>1. Program and Task Order Management Support; <br />2. Document Processing, Handling, Correspondence, and Delivery;<br />3. Document Scanning; <br />4. Document Data Entry Services, Data Analysis, Tracking Services, and Stakeholder Support; <br />5. Official Archive of Government Records; and<br />6. Transition Work Activities.</p>
<p>2. This requirement is for an offsite document control center. The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, equipment, and supplies to perform the work described in the ID/IQ Statement of Work. Except as specified in the Statement of Work, the contractor must be able to provide the facilities and infrastructure necessary to perform all task areas. Appendix A presents the initial set of off-site workload requirements for CDRH. It is anticipated, but not guaranteed, that the first task order issued under an ID/IQ for an offsite document control center would encompass these requirements. Further, task orders may require the Contractor to store the FDA documents for a period of time to be specified in the task order. In "Question and Answer" format, please provide the following information with respect to the facilities in which you would perform the work and/or your ability to obtain them:</p>
<p>&bull; Where is the facility located?<br />&bull; What is the square footage of the facility?<br />&bull; Do you currently own or lease the facility?<br />&bull; Does the facility current satisfy the security requirements set forth in the draft Statement of Work? If not, how long would it take to alter the facility to satisfy the security requirements?<br />&bull; What equipment (e.g. scanners, IT equipment, furniture, phones, vehicles, mail totes, hand trucks, telecommunications equipment, access control equipment) are in the facility?<br />&bull; What additional equipment would you need to obtain in order to satisfy solicitation requirements?</p>
<p>3. Are there any gaps (task areas not included in the Draft Statement of Work) that you believe to be necessary to obtain FDA's objectives. If you identified any gaps in the task areas in the Draft Statement of Work, please describe any relevant projects where your company provided the service or support identified and what complementary objectives were achieved. Are the described task areas and the capabilities required clearly defined? What changes, additions, updates, and clarifications would you suggest?</p>
<p>4. How would you suggest pricing this requirement? Would the facilities and equipment costs be included in the fully burdened labor rates? If not, how would they be priced (e.g. per square foot, per piece of equipment)?</p>
<p>5. The IGCE for this requirement is not yet finalized; however, it is estimated that the ID/IQ ceiling could be as high as $103M for the FDA. Please briefly - no more than two to three paragraphs - describe your capability to staff and manage a project of this magnitude and complexity in terms of project scope and multiple task order awards. Also please describe any certifications (e.g. ISO or CMMI) that demonstrate proven management and quality outcomes.</p>
<p>NOTE: if the Sources Sought results into a small business set aside solicitation, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for services, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Is your Firm able to perform at least 50 percent of the requirements with in-house labor?</p>
<p>6. Please provide documentation of the size of your business specifying whether you are classified as a small business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business and/or SBA 8(a) certified small business. SBA approved joint venture and mentor prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements (if applicable) should be included with your size determination documentation. Additionally, please demonstrate your firm's capability to meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>7. If you are a SBA 8(a) certified small business please indicate the relationship your business has with any large businesses (i.e. a mentorship or joint-venture) and how the business's resources can assist with your capability to perform the requirement. Please provide your SBA approved agreement.</p>
<p>8. Please provide the following:<br /><br />a. Organization name<br />b. DUNS number<br />c. Organization's website<br />d. Contact Name<br />e. Contact Telephone<br />f. Contact E-mail address<br />g. Size designation<br />h. Number of employees in your organization<br />i. Your organization's three (3) year annual revenue</p>
<p>9. Provide information concerning contract vehicles available to be used by the FDA in acquiring the services outlined in the draft SOW (GSA Federal Schedules, Government wide Acquisition Contract, etc.).</p>
<p>Attachments:<br />1. Draft IDIQ SOW<br />2. Appendix A - Draft CDRH Workload<br />3. Appendix B - Summary of Volume Submissions<br />4. CDRH Offsite Real Property Clauses</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing two&nbsp;resistance bridges, which are needed to measure voltage and resistance with an uncertainty of 0.07 ppm. These bridges are needed to phase out use of ASL F18 and F17 model bridges, which the NIST currently relies on for calibration and research measurements. The OEM, ASL, no longer exists, and parts and repairs for ASL bridges are no longer supported. NIST also has a requirement for an automated resistance bridge calibrator (RBC), which will replace manual RBC units. NIST relies on RBC units to maintain calibration for its own resistance bridges, and to supply bridge calibration services to customers.
<p><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for resistance ratio bridges that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.

<p>Title: Central Institutional Review Board Support Services (CIRB)<br /><br />The NCI is one of the world's largest public sponsors of clinical trials in cancer, supporting a broad range of prevention, diagnostic, imaging, and treatment studies of new drugs, procedures and multi-modality approaches for oncology patients. Developmental work for new treatments (Phase 1 and 2 trials) has traditionally been carried out in a limited number of institutions while definitive studies comparing new treatments to the standard of care (Phase 3 trials) have required multi-center collaborations. The NCI, through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) and other Divisions/Programs (e.g. Division of Cancer Prevention, Cancer Centers Program), supports multiple sites and investigators in North America to collaborate in multi-center trials/studies (e.g. NCI Cooperative Groups Clinical Trials Program for treatment and radiology imaging, Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORES), Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs), Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Programs (MB-CCOPs), Comprehensive/Clinical Cancer Centers Program, and CTEP Phase 1 and 2 Programs). These NCI multi-center programs each maintain the necessary infrastructure (e.g., scientific committees, statisticians, data managers and quality control monitors) needed to successfully perform clinical trials/studies.</p>
<p>The Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) Initiative is a project of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop and implement a centralized model of IRB review for multi-site, NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The goal of the Initiative is two-fold:</p>
<p>A. To streamline regulatory compliance and decrease the duplicative burden of protocol review that currently occurs at hundreds of local IRBs nationwide by providing a single, centralized review that can be utilized by local IRBs participating in NCI-sponsored multi-center trials.</p>
<p>B. To maintain and enhance the protection of research participants by providing consistent, expert IRB review at the national level.</p>
<p>Currently, the Initiative involves three CIRBs, the Adult CIRB - Late Phase Emphasis reviewing adult NCI-sponsored primarily Phase 3 treatment trials, the Adult CIRB - Early Phase Emphasis reviewing adult NCI-sponsored Phase 0, 1, 2 treatment trials and the PedCIRB reviewing NCI-sponsored pediatric Phase 0, 1, 2, 3, and pilot treatment trials. A fourth CIRB will be established to support DCP trials. The CIRB uses an independent model of IRB review where a local institution and principal investigators inform the CIRB about local context considerations, including local laws and requirements, via the submission of annual worksheets. Each CIRB reviews the NCI-sponsored trials within their purview and additionally review the local context considerations for each institution with investigators credentialed to participate in those trials.This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200800010C held by Emmes, Inc.</p>
<p>The NCI seeks continuation of services to be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541611. It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, completion-type contract with a base period of six months and nine six month option periods may be awarded beginning on or about August 20, 2014.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /><br />The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for several on going studies, feasibility studies, and future studies.
<p>A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Studies within REB focus on cancer risk and other health outcomes associated with medical, occupational or environmental exposure to radiation as well as the etiology of certain cancers associated with radiation exposure (e.g. thyroid, breast, leukemia) and the radiation dosimetry to assess the cancer risks under investigation.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, REB's approach has been to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate cancer risk factor information, carefully defined radiation exposure assessments, and sometimes biologic markers to provide new insights into radiation carcinogenesis. Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in REB research. REB is often called upon to address rapidly emerging issues in radiation exposure and cancer epidemiology through novel investigations and data sources. REB also assists in training the next generation of radiation epidemiologists, statisticians, and applied radiation dosimetrists. Approximately 12-30 studies in various phases will require support at any one time under the contract.</p>
<p>This support services contract is essential for REB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate radiation exposure, cancer risk factor information, and at times biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/DCEG/REB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining radiation dose for the purposes of identifying new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the dose-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic, radiation, and other risk factors related to cancer risk. Thus, the support services contract will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of and experience conducting epidemiological studies and collection of biological specimens. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and pilot) epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the REB professional staff. Some of the major activities of the contractor include: <br />1) Obtain necessary information to determine effective study resources (e.g., capabilities of collaborating institutions, numbers of eligible study subjects, exposure information, etc.) and prepare, pretest, evaluate and produce data collection forms and specification manuals, including computer-assisted questionnaires; <br />2) Provide project management and assist in the coordination of multi-center studies and facilitate cooperation between NCI and its collaborators; <br />3) Prepare training programs and materials for abstractors, interviewers and other study personnel and procedure manuals; <br />4) Arrange for the collection, handling, processing, transport and storage of biologic samples or to send them to specific laboratories as directed; <br />5) Validate cancer incidence and cause of death by performing registry linkages (e.g., linkage with cancer registries), conducting NDI+ searches, and obtaining medical records, and have them coded by appropriate nosologists, pathologists or clinicians; <br />6) Collect, code, and key data from medical and radiation records; <br />7) Trace study subjects to locate them for interview or biologic specimen collection, to determine their vital status, and obtain other information necessary for the study with the understanding that some of the subjects were last contacted years ago; <br />8) Hire, train and supervise abstractors, interviewers, telephone screeners, coders, phlebotomists and others who will be involved with acquiring and assembling data; abstract, scan, photocopy or obtain records (clinical or office medical records, hospital charts, pathology reports, radiation treatment records etc.); <br />9) Interview subjects or surrogates using mail, telephone, computer-assisted or personal interviews; <br />10) Assist in evaluating the feasibility of integrating specific molecular components into planned epidemiologic studies; <br />11) Act as a liaison for collection of radiation exposure records and arrange for estimation of radiation doses as needed; <br />12) Arrange for laboratory evaluation of biologic material; <br />13) Enter coded information into electronic databases; <br />14) Design and maintain computer databases and associated reporting software and prepare edit programs, edit data, maintain quality control, and correct computer files where necessary; prepare analytical data files and maintain version control of files as requested by the REB staff; <br />15) Document each step of a study, including decision logs, and maintain in an orderly arrangement all relevant material so that any aspect of the study may be reviewed and evaluated by the REB staff at any point in time; <br />16) Develop and manage subcontracts for conducting epidemiologic and radiation dosimetry studies inside and outside the U.S., for specialized field procedures in the U.S., and for laboratory analyses of biologic samples. <br />17) Provide the support necessary to make dose measurements using soil, archived tissues, milk, teeth, blood, human-like phantoms, computerized treatment planning programs or specialized software, as appropriate, to reconstruct radiation doses to specific organs (or sites within organs) following natural, environmental, man-made, or therapeutic and diagnostic medical exposures for ongoing epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200900017C held by Research Triangle Institute.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that one IDIQ contract may be awarded beginning on or about August 20, 2014.</p>

<DESC><p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) within the Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The National Academies of Sciences under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the project entitled, "National Research Council/Institute of Medicine Study on Integrating New Behavioral Health Measures into SAMHSA's Data Collection Programs" using FAR Part 15 procedures.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) builds upon the Mental Health Parity Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to expand and enhance the level of coverage for behavioral health services in the United States. Under these new laws, insurance providers who offer any behavioral health services must do so at a comparable level with traditional medical surgical benefits. Insurance plans sold in the insurance marketplaces and created under the auspices of the ACA are required to include substance abuse and mental health services are part of a set of essential health benefits. The expansion in coverage will have significant repercussions on the existing system of behavioral health services. New forms of financing for behavioral health services are likely to affect the ways in which providers offer care. Expanded coverage, along with increased awareness of behavioral health problems and options for addressing them, may affect the ways in which people seek care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is interested in expanding the collection of behavioral health data to improve population-based data and inform public policy. Behavioral health measures (noted above) do not currently exist.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor, The Committee on National Statistics of The National Academies has extensive experience convening expert committees from a variety of fields to provide objective, credible, and scientific recommendations addressing extremely complex health policy issues, such as the topic of this proposed study. The IOM's selection of experts draws on nationally known experts in the field, with specific consideration of the overall balance of viewpoints on the committee.</p>
<p>The Committee on National Statistics is uniquely situated to provide assessments in the areas of behavioral health services, behavioral health outcomes, and public policy. Studies are undertaken by distinguished individuals selected for their extensive expertise and experience in the topic under study. The IOM can secure the participation of experts whom it invites to serve. The National Academies work is made possible by 6,000 of the world's top scientists, engineers, and other professionals who volunteer their time without compensation to serve on committees and participate in activities.</p>
<p>The scope of work is available and attached. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or&nbsp;proposal, which shall be considered by the agency, electronically to Jennifer Eskandari at Jennifer.eskandari@psc.hhs.gov. Responses are due by June 6, 2014 by 12:00 pm EST. Responses will not be accepted after the due date. If no capability statements or&nbsp;proposals are received which specifically demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with negotiating a Cost plus no fee order with The National Academies of Sciences Institute of Medicine.</p>

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) builds upon the Mental Health Parity Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to expand and enhance the level of coverage for behavioral health services in the United States. Under these new laws, insurance providers who offer any behavioral health services must do so at a comparable level with traditional medical surgical benefits. Insurance plans sold in the insurance marketplaces and created under the auspices of the ACA are also required to include substance abuse and mental health services and are now part of a set of essential health benefits. Expanded insurance coverage and new options for addressing behavioral health problems may create new opportunities for people to seek care, but only if social factors do not prevent individuals from accessing care and individuals have the necessary knowledge to seek care.
<p>The proposed contractor, The Institute of Medicine (IOM) at The National Academies of Sciences has extensive experience convening expert committees from a variety of fields to provide objective, credible, and scientific recommendations addressing extremely complex health policy issues, such as the topic of this proposed study. The IOM's selection of experts draws on nationally known experts in the field, with specific consideration of the overall balance of viewpoints on the committee.</p>
<p>The Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences at the IOM has deep experience in conducting studies concerning the organization, financing, effectiveness, workforce, and delivery of health care, as well as vast experience in performing the activities required to successfully complete the proposed ASPE project. Staff members have a wide range of experience, expertise and skills. The National Academies were created by the federal government to be advisers on scientific and technological matters. The core services of the National Academies involve collecting, analyzing, and sharing information and knowledge. The independence of the institution, combined with its unique ability to convene national experts, allows it to be responsive to a host of requests.</p>
<p>The scope of work is available and attached. All responsible sources&nbsp;may submit a capability statement or&nbsp;proposal, which shall be considered by the agency,&nbsp;electronically to Jennifer Eskandari at Jennifer.eskandari@psc.hhs.gov.

If no capability statements or proposals&nbsp;are received which specifically demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with negotiating a Cost plus no fee&nbsp;order with The National Academies of Sciences.</p>

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, transportation, materials, and equipment <br> necessary to shred/mulch in place all eastern red cedar trees (living and dead) from a <br> minimum of 60 acres (BASE- Required), and up to a maximum of 107 acres (BASE <br> and OPTIONS). Eastern red cedar tree stumps shall not exceed two (2) inches above <br> the natural ground surface and shall have no limbs or branches remaining. Mulch <br> shall be spread throughout the work unit (not placed in piles). Mulch shall be <br> scattered so that the depth does not exceed two (2) inches. No mulch larger than onehalf <br> cubic foot shall remain within the units.

All tree shredding/mulching operations shall be conducted in a safe and <br> professional manner.
