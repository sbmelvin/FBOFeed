<DESC>The Human Engineering Research Laboratories at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) are expanding their product testing and prototype facilities to encompass prosthetic limb testing and manufacturing.  VAPHS intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MTS Systems Corporation, 3645 Perrysville Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA  15214 to purchase a customizable load and kinematic testing platform that can be adjusted easily for different types of prosthesis (below/above elbow, below/above knee) and can be expandable to incorporate additional actuators.  The MTS Biomechanics Toolkit is a highly customizable platform because it is not based on a stndard load-frame setup, but rather a bolt-down table where the actuators and load cells can be moved and additional actuators added for the multiple degrees of freedom that we will require for testing in the future.  Our initial phase requirements for the device are: 1) Complete hydraulic pumping system and integrated computer-control system expandable to accommodate at least 3 actuators and 3 load measuring devices.  2) One 1DOF actuator (tension/compression) w/>3000lbf load capacity, and > 9" inch stroke. 3)  One uniaxial load cell (with load limits to accommodate above actuator). 4)  A load-frame chassis/table to allow for multiple-positioning of several actuators to accommodate testing (fatigue, and load-to-failure) of devices spanning from 8" to 42" in length, and approximately 6" in diameter. 5) Power requirements:  120V, 220V 1-phase OR 206 or 230 volts 3-phase power.  If your firm has a comparable toolkit which you would like us to consider, please submit manufacturer's literature and documentation that the equipment meets our requirements to Linda.Glancy@med.va.gov or to Linda Glancy (04A-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206, NLT 2/23/05. Technical questions can be directed to Jon Pearlman, M.Sc., at (412) 365-4850 or jlp46@pitt.edu.  This is not a request for quotations or proposals.  The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will make a determination whether to issue a competitive solictation based on any responses received.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:  The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and subsystem level technologies that when integrated into the tactical environment provide revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. The DARPA/TTO program will consider a broad range of technologies but focuses on the development and demonstration of complete systems or subsystems rather than basic sciences. Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems.  AREAS OF INTEREST:  DARPA is the central research and development organization for the Department of Defense (DoD). It manages and directs selected basic and applied research and development projects for DoD, and pursues research and technology where risk and payoff are both very high and where success may provide dramatic advances for traditional military roles and missions.  DARPA/TTO focuses on technologies in the context of platforms and develops technologies that enable new system and platform functionality, such as autonomous and semiautonomous operations, controls, sensors, weapons, power, and propulsion. For specific examples of systems currently under development by TTO, see "Programs" at www.darpa.mil/tto/. Concepts for C3I, microfabrication, materials, or basic science may be of greater interest to one or more of the other DARPA Offices listed at www.darpa.mil. This BAA seeks new ideas, not necessarily extensions of the current programs.  TTO priorities fall within four primary focus areas: 1) Space, including: a) small, low-cost, high-performance satellites, b) rapid, flexible, low-cost launch, and c) operations in space, including space control and situational awareness; 2) Unmanned Vehicles, including: a) low-altitude operation - mobility and speed among natural and manmade obstacles, b) deployment and operation by lower echelons, c) reduced logistical and human burden,  d) weapons integration and release e) increased autonomy for enhanced manned/unmanned teaming, and  f) infantry support robots; 3) Tactical Multipliers, including: a) new vehicle and weapon concepts for ground, air, and sea , b) force protection (defensive and counterfire) against conventional weapons and WMD, c) technologies enabling higher-performance platforms and weapons; d) non-lethal anti-personnel weapons; e) ultra-precise, near-instantaneous power projection; f) situational awareness; and 4) Urban Warfare and Low Intensity Operations, including: a) decisive conflict and stable peacekeeping with minimal US casualties, b) rapid neutralization of combatants with minimal effect on non-combatants, and c) flexibility to rapidly adjust and compensate for new tactics and responses to US force structure; d) boundless urban access with minimal disruption; e) rapid control, stabilization, and pacification during military operations. Other novel ideas that enhance military effectiveness and particularly that tilt the balance of asymmetric warfare in favor of the US will also be considered.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The Government plans to make $8.0M of FY 2005 funds available to fund projects under this BAA, though more may be made available. Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2005 funds. For Government programmatic flexibility, offerors should segment their cost proposals into an initial 12-month (or shorter) phase which explores and validates the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more phases proposed as optional efforts leading toward technology development. The total effort including options should not exceed five years. TTO typically provides $200K to $1000K for the initial phase. Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.  This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals on proposed research. TTO will treat a white paper as an inquiry and will respond with a recommendation based on the likelihood of selection of a proposal. TTO will treat a proposal as an offer and will respond either by not selecting it for funding or selecting it for funding and negotiation by a Contracting Officer. White papers should be brief summaries; proposal should be more detailed and complete.  The submission of a white paper is optional, but recommended. It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with TTO, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA. The white paper should clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development being proposed. Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated. Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  OFFERORS:  Teaming is encouraged. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in innovative tactical technology. Proposals from US government entities, FFRDCs, and other offerors who are proposing additional work under existing task order contracts will not be considered part of this BAA but may be evaluated by TTO separately from the BAA proposals.  SCHEDULE:  TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award. For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO no later than 03-30-05. In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO no later than 6-22-05.  White papers received after 1600 local time 12/8/05 will not be evaluated under this BAA. The BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 local time on the closing date, 2/16/06. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. As soon as the evaluation of a proposal is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected for funding pending contract negotiations, or 2) the proposal has not been selected. One copy of each non-selected proposal will be retained for the files. Any additional copies of non-selected proposals will be destroyed upon non-selection.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) Overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach. 2) Potential contribution to TTO mission, including the likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful. 3) Offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort. 4) Project plan. 5) Cost realism.  HUMAN USE IN RESEARCH:  Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards, and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during  the entire length of the proposed effort.  For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Human Research Protections website (www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).  FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL:  The form and format for white papers and proposals follows below. White papers and proposals that do not satisfy these form and format requirements or with differing content between their electronic and paper versions may be rejected without further review or evaluation. All submissions should be in the English language. White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Proposals should also be submitted electronically but in addition, two paper copies of each proposal, accompanied by a transmittal letter signed by an official who is authorized to commit the offeror should be mailed to the address below. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word format and submitted via e-mail or on CD-ROM. Submission deadlines apply both to electronic and paper versions. All copies of white papers and proposals should be sent to:  E-Mail: BAA05-22@darpa.mil.  Mail: DARPA, TTO, ATTN: BAA 05-22, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s (GSA) Lease No. GS-05B-17470 expires in the near future.  The lease covers approximately 9,000 usable square feet of office and warehouse related space in a high quality, specific-use office building with 35 reserved surface parking spaces in Rock Island, IL.  GSA is interested in considering alternate space if economically advantageous to the Government.  In determining whether relocation would be economically feasible to the Government, GSA will consider cost factors including but not limited to the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and the anticipated rent for the space, as well as other factors impacting the Government’s rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that might be required at an alternate location, the length of time necessary to deliver the space ready for occupancy, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term.  The Government's preference is for a 5-year firm term.  Persons interested in providing space to the Government who believe they can do so at terms more favorable than those contained in a succeeding lease should contact Tina Church at (312) 353-5068 or Jae Lee at (202) 478-8669.

<DESC>1.0 Description. 1.1  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is seeking sources for the potential development of a Communications at Speed & Depth (CSD) capability for U.S.  Navy submarines.   This capability will provide communications with submarines while they are submerged at normal operating depths and traveling at speeds required to perform tactical operations.   CSD extends the FORCEnet construct to stealthy undersea Navy platforms with the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of these platforms in achieving the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) SEAPOWER 21 vision. 1.2  Interested parties are requested to provide a written response to this notice.  Parties may include industry, Government laboratories, federally funded laboratories and academic institutions. 1.3  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this potential requirement. 2.0 Background. 2.1  The U.S.  Navy is seeking to implement a communications capability for submerged submarines and other undersea platforms that is technically and operationally suitable for 21st Century operations employing Network Centric Warfare, Joint Task Forces, and Allied-partner forces.   Carrier Strike Group (CSG), Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) and Joint Commanders require rapid Command and Control (C2) communications for assigned forces that operate in the undersea domain.  U.S.  Navy Fast Attack Submarines (SSN), Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN), Guided Missile Submarines (SSGN) and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV) require rapid secure communications with acceptable throughputs between all levels of command while operating at tactical speeds and depths. Undersea forces' primary C4 systems must support integrated global communications for data exchange with tactical and operational commanders. 2.2  While operating in a submerged tactical stealth profile, submarines need to be able to transmit and receive data with low latency between Strike Group Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and coalition forces.  A combination of communications capabilities is needed to achieve this level of connectivity due to different geographic locations, ocean environments, operational security requirements, and infrastructure availability.   Three primary communications modes are needed: 1) Two-way networked general data exchange connectivity between a submarine and a communications node (shore, afloat, air or undersea) that is interoperable with staPDPArd networks (e.g., Ethernet LAN, SIPRNET), applications (e.g., email, web browsers), and RF data links (e.g., satellite communications, line-of-sight radio link with aircraft); 2) One-way data transmission from a communications node to the submarine; 3) One-way transmission of data from the submarine to a communications node.   The types of data exchanged include: (1) "paging"  -- similar to the commercial pager concept; (2) "text messaging" â€“ similar to the commercial wireless PDA and SMS text messaging concepts; (3) "IP data" â€“ general data exchange utilizing Internet Protocol datagram staPDPArds interoperable with commercial networks, computers, and operating systems. 2.3  Several potential modalities, such as electromagnetic, acoustic, or optical concepts, may be used to implement a CSD capability.   The mode of undersea data transmission need not be compatible with existing government or commercial communications standards.   However, an interface will be needed to a human operator, standard network, RF data link, or satellite.   It is not required to use a symmetrical approach for transmit and receive functions; different modalities and data rates may be acceptable. 2.4  All candidates will be evaluated to determine their potential impact upon the submarine hulls.  The majority of the CSD installations will be backfits on existing platforms.  Any need to penetrate the submarine hull or make significant hull modifications on existing platforms will impose high costs. Available "real estate" on SSN platforms (LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, and VIRGINIA Classes) is limited.  Proposed solutions need to address the limitations in volume and weight that are imposed upon hardware installed on these submarines.  However, the SSGN platforms provide significant volume and weight capabilities for a payload. 3.0 Requested Information. The following information is requested to assist the Navy in evaluating the respondent's concept. 3.1  General Concept.  Describe the general concept of operation of the proposed technology.   The use of figures or graphics is encouraged. 3.2  Operational Capabilities.  Discuss the often-interrelated parameters of submarine speed and depth, data rate, range from communications node, latency, and availability/robustness.   Describe the potential submarine speed and depth envelope in which the proposed concept will be operable. 3.2.1  Submarine Operational Parameters.  The minimum capabilities are: keel depth of 150 feet depth, 6 knots of speed, and sea state 3.   The desired capabilities are: full submarine operating depth, speed of 15 knots or more, and operation in a sea state of 5 or greater.   The acceptable ranges from a communications node are dependent upon the concept of operation. 3.3  Communications Capability: There are no specific requirements regarding the mode of communications to be used (e.g., RF Line of Sight (LOS), satellite communications, aircraft-based communications, acoustic, or optical.) A two-way communications link may be asymmetrical, using two different modes, frequency bands, data rates, etc., for receive and transmit.  If the selected mode requires the deployment of a new infrastructure that is not likely to be available in the corresponding time frame based upon known DoD and commercial plans (e.g., a new satellite system), this fact will be considered as a cost or risk issue during the Navy's evaluation. 3.3.1  Data Rate, Robustness, and Latency:  Data rate requirements are dependent upon the communications mode and the type of data transferred.  A robust 10 bps is adequate for a "pager" capability.    100 bps is adequate for a "text message" type of capability.   For the two-way exchange of networked IP data, a data rate of 100 kbps is desirable, but a robust 1 kbps data rate may be acceptable.   The bit error rate of the data transfer needs to be appropriate for the type of data transferred; some errors in text messaging may be acceptable (if identified to the user), but reliable paging and IP data transfer must be error-free from the user's perspective.   The time delay to deliver a message from the moment it is initiated by the user or the time delay to deliver a response to a received message should not exceed 15 minutes; it is desirable that this latency be less than five minutes. 3.4  Deployment Methods.  If hardware must be deployed to utilize the capability (e.g., towed, tethered, or launched), describe the deployment approach, the stowage of the hardware on the submarine, needs for support by other platforms or resources (if applicable), and the recovery process (if applicable.) The stowage and use of the hardware should present a minimal impact to the submarine's maneuverability, mission, and vulnerability. 3.5  Stealth.  Discuss the proposed concept's impact to submarine stealth when installed, loaded/deployed (if applicable to the concept), and operated. 3.5.1  Compromise to the platform's vulnerability while transmitting energy should be minimal.  It is also essential that data transmission security requirements are met, but it is anticipated that conventional crypto techniques and equipment will be used to achieve this capability. 3.6  Network Capability:  If applicable, discuss the potential of integrating the proposed concept into a networked two-way communications solution that is integrated into the Navy C4I infrastructure. 3.7  Undersea Communications with Non-Submarine Undersea Platforms and Off-board Sensors: Although this announcement primarily addresses submarine communications at speed and depth, the U.S.  Navy is also interested in capabilities for communications with UUVs, undersea sensors, and other undersea devices.  If applicable, discuss the potential of utilizing the proposed concept with these emerging platforms and devices. 4.0 Responses. 4.1  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper. 4.2  White papers in Microsoft Office 2000 compatible or Adobe PDF format are due no later than 1 April 2005.

Additional applicable contract terms and conditions are: 252.212-7000 and 252.212-7001, including 52.203-3, 252.232-7003 and 252.243-7002; 52.212-2--the award will be based on an evaluation of past performance and price. U.S. DOL, Wage Determination Nos. 94-3024 (Rev 15) and 94-2116 (Rev 16) apply. Any exceptions to the SOW may result in an unacceptable quo! te. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price type purchase order to the eligible, responsible quoter whose quotation represents the best value considering both past performance and price with past performance more important than price. PAST PERFORMANCE: The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the item description herein, performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (name, phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quotation. The information should include, however! , discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quotation of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quotation to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quotation when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past perfo! rmance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government determines are most relevant to the RFQ. Oral quotations are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All quotations shall include a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. Responses to this notice are required, in writing, by 24 February 2005, and shall be mailed to Anita Spriggs, Code 204.21E, 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 2B, FISC Norfolk, Contracting Dept., Phila. Div., Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083; faxed to (215) 697-5418; or emailed to anita.spriggs@navy.mil. Quotations over 10 pages in tota! l will not be accepted by facsimile. All responsible sources may submit a quotation for consideration. See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to enter into negotiations with current members of the Cancer Genetics Network (CGN), which includes the eight CGN Participating Centers (PC) and their associated sites (S), referred to collective as the PC&S and the three CGN Informatics Technology Group (ITG).  

The current members of the CGN are as follows:

University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland
Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C.
University of Washington, Seattle, Washington
Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  
University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts
Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut
Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina
Baylor University, Waco, Texas
University of Texas – Southwest, Dallas, Texas
University of Texas - San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 
University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico

The CGN is an NCI-sponsored research infrastructure comprising a multi-site registry of persons with cancer or at high risk of cancer and their families for investigations on the genetics of cancer and other related issues.  Currently, the CGN has over 24,000 enrollees in its recruitment pool, representing more than 16,000 families on whom a wide variety of data have been collected, including biospecimens on some.  The NCI wishes to maintain the integrity of the CGN enrollee pool as well as the functions performed by the CGN which maintain that enrollee’s pool and its annual follow-up.  Furthermore, inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling this requirement makes competition (with the exception of those identified above as members of the CGN) unfeasible for the acquisition.  NCI will award a contract to only one (1) of the current members of the CGN and that awardee will function as the Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC) which will manage the CGN sites’ and the Software Center subcontracts.  The SCC will be required to complete the majority of tasks requested.  The SCC will unify the CGN Core Database and the CGN Special Studies database into one (unified) CGN enrollee database.  The CGN enrollee database will need to be maintained.  Tasks associated with its maintenance include monitoring and quality control of annual follow-up at each CGN site.  The anticipated award date for this acquisition is December 31, 2005 for a period of five years.

Professional translation services will be required by NBC to support MCC's review of proposals, due diligence assessments, negotiation of agreements, and oversight of MCC-funded programs with the selected eligible countries.

Price Offerors are required to be registered in Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) to be eligible for award of a contract with the Federal Government. There is no commitment to a minimum or maximum amount of work implied by submitting an application nor is there a guaranteed quantity of work implied by being accepted for contract award by the NBC.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) Climate Change Division (CCD) Climate Analysis Branch (CAB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Colorado State University, The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), Colorado.   The USEPA has projected baseline global nitrous oxide emissions for the years 2010 and 2020 assuming business as usual crop management.  Process based models such as DAYCENT, can be used  to investigate the mitigation potential, as well as the effect on crop yields, of different land management scenarios.  The objective of this acquisition is to use the analysis results from the DAYCENT model to support EPA's efforts to assess the potential to mitigate agricultural greenhouse gas  emissions for key countries and regions. The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory will run and manipulate the DAYCENT model to provide net greenhouse gas mitigation analysis for croplands for major world agricultural regions.  The National Resource Ecology Laboratory will acquire the meteorological  and soils needed to run DAYCENT.  NREL will consult with EPA to identify feasible land management strategies intended to reduce nitrous oxide emissions.  Results will be provided to collaborators at EPA and IFPRI so that the economic impacts of the different options can be evaluated.  The period of  performance for this Purchase Order will be from date of award through 12/31/2005.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620.

The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
Anniston Army Depot (ANAD, the Depot, or the Installation) is located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in northeast Alabama. It occupies over 25 square miles of land, encompassing more than 18,000 acres of woodland and 10 acres of lakes and streams. Although rural in locale, ANAD is easily accessible by road, rail, and air. Within five miles of its southern boundary, Interstate 20 serves as a major east-west artery, providing access to Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, numerous common carrier routes surround ANAD’s boundary while two airports capable of accommodating the C-5 cargo plane provide air transportation within an 8-mile radius. Immediate access to a main rail line is also available within the boundaries of the Depot. ANAD contains approximately 2,100 buildings/structures, 266 miles of roadway, 87 miles of fencing, and 46 miles of railroad. The Depot’s population is composed of approximately 3,500 military, civilian, and contractor employees.

From its origin in 1942 as a storage depot, Anniston Army Depot has transformed into a state-of-the-art maintenance facility. ANAD is the only Army depot capable of performing maintenance on both heavy and light-tracked combat vehicles and their components. The Depot is designated as the Center of Technical Excellence for the M1 Abrams Tank and is the designated candidate Depot for the repair of the M60, AVLB, M728, and M88 combat vehicles. ANAD has assumed responsibility for the towed and self-propelled artillery as well as the M113 family of vehicles.

Under partnership agreements, a wide range of vehicle conversions and upgrades are currently underway at ANAD. The Depot also performs maintenance on individual and crew-served weapons as well as land combat missiles and small arms. Additionally, the maintenance and storage of conventional ammunition and missiles, as well as the storage of seven percent of the Nation’s chemical munitions stockpile (until the stockpile is demilitarized), are significant parts of the Depot’s overall missions and capabilities. 

ANAD is generally divided into three geographic zones: West Area, East Area, and the Restricted Area pr Ammunition Limited Area. (Most of the Installation utility maps are labeled by these area designations. The West Area consists of primarily administration support facilities, warehousing facilities, shops, restaurant, wash racks, spill pad, the diesel fuel tanker loading area, and the one and only family housing unit on the Installation (Commander’s quarters). The East Area consists primarily of industrial and manufacturing activities but also includes the main post restaurant and the sewage treatment plant. The Restricted Area, more recently named the Ammunition Limited Area (ALA), encompasses the Ammunition Storage Area (ASA), the Chemical Limited Area (CLA), and the Chemical Demilitarization Area. As indicated by the names of the subdivisions, various ordnance-related activities are conducted from storage through demilitarization (incineration). Because of the nature of the stored munitions and associated activities, these ALA subdivisions have progressively more restricted security measures and chemical protection procedures. The Chemical Demilitarization Area (currently operated by Westinghouse), a 30-acre complex located near the north boundary of the ALA and separated by special security fencing is excluded from this privatization package. 
 
The following system descriptions provide potential offerors with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the utility systems. 
ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Anniston Army Depot currently purchases electric power from Alabama Power Company (APC). APC provides medium voltage power supply via one 44 kV feeder that enters the Main Substation at ANAD. A separate APC feeder supplies power for the Chemical Demilitarization Facility. This electrical supply, including the distribution system inside the Chemical Demilitarization Facility, is excluded from this utility privatization package.

The Main Substation has two bays that are both fed from the one incoming 44 kV feeder. APC owns the seven substation power transformers (six active and one spare). Each bay consists of three 1-phase transformers (44/12.47 kV). One bay totals 7.5 MVA capacity and the other totals 14 MVA capacity. The ANAD ownership and maintenance responsibility begins at the low side connections of the transformers.
The electrical distribution system at ANAD consists of four 12.47/7.2 kV feeders which originate in the Main Substation. Two feeders form a large loop circuit that feeds the east area of the Depot. The other two feeders form a loop that feeds the west area of the Depot, including the headquarters and office areas.

Anniston Army Depot owns and operates an electrical utility system consisting of:
•	approximately 54 circuit miles of 12.47/7.2 kV overhead primary distribution lines;
•	approximately 5.6 circuit miles of 12.47/7.2 kV underground primary distribution lines;
•	approximately 6.7 miles of street/security lighting circuits;
•	eight MV oil / vacuum circuit breakers; and
•	3,750 kVA regulators

The electrical distribution system at ANAD was initially constructed during 1941 to 1945. The electrical system has been revised from time to time as the load requirements have changed. The present electrical network consists of overhead circuits installed on single wood poles with conventional pin type insulators installed on wood cross arms. Distribution class transformers (pole type or pad-mounted type) are installed near individual load concentrations. 

On the east side of the Depot is a very large manufacturing and production facility that is serviced by 12.4 kV circuits. These 12.4 kV circuits are constructed on single wood pole structures, generally with 8-foot cross arms and pin-type insulators. The conductors range in size from #2 copper to 397 MCM ACSR. The loop feeders have group operated load-break switches installed on pole tops for maintenance and protection purposes. 
The two circuits (feeders) that form the loop feeding the west area are virtually the same configuration, single wood pole, with 8-foot cross arms; however, there are a few structures in the west area that have insulator brackets and standoff type insulators installed. This feeder also feeds manufacturing and production facilities in the west portion of the Depot, plus the headquarters area and a large warehouse area. Portions of these feeders also extend into the Restricted Area (Ammunition Storage Area (ASA) and Chemical Limited Area (CLA)) where there are large ammunition storage igloos and munitions processing facilities.

There are two regulator stations in the west feeder loop. One is referred to as the West Area Regulator Sub. It contains a 1500 KVAR regulator bank, two vacuum circuit breakers, and bypass switches. The second, referred to as the NW Regulator Station, is located in the restricted ASA. It contains one 1500 KVAR regulator bank and bypass switches. The regulator units serve to stabilize the voltage requirement in the two different areas while line capacitor banks, installed at several locations, also aid in voltage stabilization and improve the power factor.

As indicated, most of the circuitry in the system is overhead. The only significant area of underground circuitry is in the Restricted Area.

The street lighting system at the Depot is limited. Most of the lights are tapped off of the distribution line servicing a given area.

POTABLE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The Anniston Waterworks and Sewer Board (AWSB), from whom ANAD purchases all potable water, draws raw water from Coldwater Spring, a high quality, dependable source requiring primarily chlorination and fluoridation. ANAD receives water through two metering points along the AWSB 20-inch transmission main. This main runs outside ANAD’s southeast boundary, between the metering points and the Coldwater Pumping Station. 

Two (2) booster pump stations serve to increase pressures where long transmission lines serve distant storage tanks or the industrial/production areas. Station No. 227 houses two 40 horsepower (hp) centrifugal pumps in a 10’ x 15’ prefabricated metal building. This station is located south of the ASA and pumps water, via an 8-inch water line, to ground storage tank No.700 in the CLA. Station No. 396 houses two 10 hp horizontal split case centrifugal pumps in an approximately 20’ x 15’ concrete block building. 

The distribution system contains approximately 57 miles of transmission mains and smaller supply lines. A substantial percentage of the system was constructed in the 1940s. Mains range in size from 6- to 12-inches in diameter and are of two materials: asbestos cement (transite) and cast iron. Smaller sizes (4-inches and less) supply individual structures, manufacturing and production buildings, and warehouse facilities. The system includes the main line valves, air release/vacuum relief valves, pressure reducing valves, blow-off valve vaults, fire hydrants, post indicating valves, and ground level and underground water storage facilities. The existing system has been modified to some degree, with individual sections of the system having undergone rehabilitation such as cleaning, repairing, slip-lining, and total replacement in some cases.

Potable water is stored in five ground storage reservoirs with a combined storage capacity of 3.0 million gallons (MG). 

WASTEWATER (SANITARY SEWAGE) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The sanitary sewer system of ANAD was constructed in the 1940s, and consists of approximately 31 miles of primarily vitrified clay and cast iron sewer pipe. The mains are primarily 6 and 8-inch diameters. The sewage collection system also includes 14 lift stations in the West Area, 11 lift stations in the East Area, seven lift stations in the ASA, two lift stations in the CLA, and one lift station at the Chemical Demilitarization Facility.
Sewage from the East and West Areas is pumped, via 8- and 4-inch cast iron force mains, to a sewage treatment plant (STP) located just west of the East Area. Sewage from the ASA is pumped through a 6-inch force main to a point approximately 1,000 feet southwest of the STP. From that point, sewage is gravity fed through an 8-inch main to the STP.

ANAD’s manholes are constructed of pre-cast concrete with brick chimneys supporting the frame and cover. Manholes are adequately located and are in average condition. Two lift stations, No. 194 and No. 445, are the main lift stations that service the West and East Areas, respectively. Both of these lift stations are wet well/dry well type stations. They are housed in brick or concrete block buildings, and include comminutors, two or three pumps, and an emergency backup generator. The other lift stations in the East, West, and ASA Areas are underground wet well type facilities without buildings and backup emergency generators.
 
ANAD owns and operates a 0.62 million gallons per day (MGD) (which is the original design capacity) STP located south of the ASA. The plant processes approximately 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day from four wastewater streams: treated effluent from the industrial wastewater treatment plant, domestic sewage from the East industrial area, domestic sewage from the West administrative area, and domestic sewage from the Restricted Area. The STP utilizes an activated sludge process consisting of two equalization ponds, providing pre-aeration, and two parallel extended aeration package plants. The aeration plants consist of a splitter box, two aerobic digesters, two aeration basins, and three clarifiers. The old STP was rebuilt in 1981, at which time the equalization pond and the two package plants were installed. At that time, one of the existing clarifiers was converted to a sand filter, while the existing trickling filter was converted to four drying beds. Two-stage ultra-violet disinfection was also installed in 1992. In accordance with ANAD’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), the STP effluent is piped several miles off the Installation to the permitted outfall on Choccolocco Creek. 

Sludge from the sewage treatment plant is usually dried on sludge beds.  If necessary, wet sludge may be combined with non-hazardous sludge from the Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (excluded from this privatization initiative) and pressed to remove most of the water.  In either event, dried or pressed sludge is removed from the Installation and disposed by service contract.  


All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Nancy Barnett at 703-767-9402 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after March 2, 2005.

<DESC>Facility Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Services for Memphis Internal Revenue Service Center.   Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. TIRSE-04-Q-00016, dated 09/02/2004, was issued soliciting Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contractors.  It is the government’s intent to award a combination firm-fixed-priced/time-and-materials type task order to the successful FSS contractor offering the best value to the government.   The task order will consist of a base period ending 9/30/2005 and four 12-month option renewal periods.  The task order will consist primarily of FSS priced services that are contained within one or more of the successful contractor’s special item numbers (SIN) awarded by General Service Administration under FSS No. 03FAC.  It is anticipated that a small portion of the contractor’s firm-fixed-price may consist of open market items necessary to fulfill the government’s complete O&M service requirement outlined in the RFQ.  It is also anticipated that a portion of the time-and-material priced services (related services to be ordered on an as-needed basis) may result in some open market items being procured during the course of the order period.   Open market items may include such costs as subcontract and/or other direct costs not included in the successful contractor’s FSS award.  The government intends to award a task order, and include any open market items if applicable, to that FSS contractor offering the best value, without seeking any further competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: W912PL-05-R-0004 Title:  (Special Notice) Main Base Runway Replacement Location:  Edwards AFB, CA Price Range:  $25,000,000 - $100,000,000 Media:  Web This special notice invites interested contractors to participate in an INDUSTRY DAY for the Main Base Runway Replacement at Edwards AFB, CA.  Purpose of this Industry Day: 1.  To provide industry an information presentation on the Runway MILCON Project to describe the scope of work, requirements, schedule. 2.  To request from industry their perception and ideas on what they need to see in the Request for Proposals for (a) material investigation (b) geotechnical information (c) design details to provide a good cost proposal. This Special Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposals.   This is a Two-Phase Design-Build  procurement.   Issuance of the solicitation for Phase One is TBD.  Issuance of the solicitation for Phase Two is TBD.  This project is subject to availabil ity of funds. The project is located on an airfieldaccess is controlled and airfield requirement will be in effect.  This project is a Best Value, two-phase design-build solicitation. The detailed project performance requirements for this project will be included in th e Requests for Proposals (RFP) package (phase-two).  The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree on design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements.  The successful Contra ctor must design and construct complete and useable facilities, as described in the RFP documents.    One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Phase I is the pre-selection phase (this phase does not include the submission of a price proposal).   Proposals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase Two and an amendment will be issued to those selected offerors (minimum of three, maximum of five).  Selection of offerors for involvement in Phase two w ill be based on technical approach and performance capability.  Detailed project design requirements will then be added by amendment to the solicitation at the start of Phase Two of the Request for Proposals.  A maximum of five offerors will be invited to participate in the second phase.  Phase 2 proposal ratings will be used to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Award of the Design-Build contract will be made to one of the five firms, which, in the judgment of the Contracting Offi cer, provides the best combination of design features and cost/price reasonableness.  In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are of equal importance.  The Government reserves the right to make award to o ther than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This project is to construct a temporary 220 ft x 12000 ft asphalt runway with associated taxiway connectors 2,500 feet from the existing main runway; to demolish the existing main runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California and to c onstruct a new 300 ft x 15,000 ft concrete runway.  Both runways must be capable of supporting large aircraft, including the B-2, B-52 and 747.  New temporary runway: 260,00 SM = 2,800,000 SF; Replace existing runway: 390,335 SM = 4,200,000 SF. REQUIREMENT:  Edwards Air Force Base requires a runway that can safely support a wide range of aircraft test operations, including launch and recovery of prototype aircraft, heavy aircraft operations to include the B-1, B-2, B-52, KC-135, 747, and various forms of failure testing as well as recovery and transport of the NASA Space Shuttle.  Construction of a temporary runway is needed to allow transfer of all flight operations from the existing runway during construction. Missions that require a 15,000 ft r unway include refused take-off testing of heavy aircraft, wet brake testing of heavy aircraft, hot weather operatio ns of specific aircraft such as the T-38, and recovery of the NASA Space Shuttle. CURRENT SITUATION:  The main base runway which supports almost every flight operation at Edwards Air Force Base is nearly 50 years old an is rapidly degrading as a result of alkali-silica reaction (ASR), a reaction between the cement and the aggregate that  creates cracking, scaling and spalling of the concrete.  Increased sweeper operations and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) walks are necessary to eliminate concrete chunks several inches across that are routinely discovered.  Emergency FOD repairs have forced runway closures affecting 10 to 15 flights for each closure.  Pavement Conditions Index (PCI) numbers are dropping rapidly, which is indicative of pavements nearing the end of their useful life.   The runway will soon fail functionally and will no longer b e safe for aircraft operations.  In early FY03 the runway was evaluated by a tri-service team of experts who rated the pavement conditions along with the centerline as MARGINAL, with potions predicted to be UNSATISFACTORY within the next year.  Functional failure of the runway is expected in 2008.  No other runways at Edwards AFB can safely support the current and projected test operations without significant test mission delays.  Temporary relocation of these missions is not feasible.  However, many of the  current and planned test missions can be supported by a new temporary runway. The estimated cost of this project is from $75,000,000  $125,000,000.  Phase I evaluations may be based on the contractors past performance, to include the design firm; contractors organization; contractors specialized experience on similar type work; contractors capability, to include key personnel qualifications and experience; past performance on utilization of Small Business Concerns; preliminary quality control plans and safety program; a narrative addressing the technical approach; and a narrativ e addressing the process approach.  Phase II evaluations are anticipated to be based on, but may not be limited to, such items as pavement design;  narrative/technical solutions, to include disciplines such as civil, pavement engineering, structural, elect rical; to include innovation and efficiency; proposed management plan; proposed quality control plan for design and construction; a preliminary schedule; and phasing approach.  SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY DAY:   Please contact Mr. Kenneth Crawford or Mr. Edgar Mendoza, Base CE Project Management Office, for additional information regarding security requirements, base admission, and your firms participation in Industry Day.   In addition, no more than 3 visitors p er firm will be permitted.  No exceptions will be made.  Please ensure that all personnel are aware of these restrictions.

<CONTACT>Andy Eiermann, 256-313-0097
<DESC>Answers to questions: QUESTION 3: I do not see any mention in the SOW for any type of finishes in the Reverberation chamber nor the control room. Am I to assume that the shielded walls in these will rooms will be finished wall material? ANSWER 3: Yes . The shielded wall itself will be fine. The government would actually prefer that this was the case, especially with the reverberation chamber because additional finishes could lower the performance of the chamber. QUESTION 4: In regard to the automation system scope for the reverberation chamber, it is our understanding that this would include the mechanisms and controls for operation of the paddle & drive assemblies only. All necessary test equipment, cabling, software, antenna, etc. will be by Redstone.  Is this correct? ANSWER 4: (Yes).  QUESTION 5: Is there a desire to have vendors provide integration services of existing Redstone test equipment to create an optimized system for testing? ANSWER 5: (No) the government wants the vendor to provide the soft ware and cabling to control the tuner paddles. The government will put in its own antennas and cabling for the equipment under test. As stated in the SOW: Testing will be to MIL-STD-461E, MIL-STD-464A, and ADS-37A test levels and procedures. MIL-STD-461E s pecifies how the tuner paddles will operate. QUESTION 6: I may have missed this somewhere in the RFP, but what is the frequency range of interest for the anechoic chamber? ANSWER 6: Per the SOW, the government will be testing to MIL-STD-461E, MIL-STD-464A,  and ADS-37A-PRF, and those frequency ranges will be of interest. The composite range of all of them (radiated) is 10 kHz - 45 GHz. QUESTION 7:  Would it be acceptable to offer RF absorber options that may be less than 12 inches deep or up to 18 inches dee p? The RFP states 12 inches deep RF absorber to be applied. ANSWER 7: 12 inch max would be the governments preference to give the largest testable area. Less than 12 inches will be perfectly fine if the performance is acceptable per the SOW. QUESTION 8: W hat is the target reflectivity values (-dB) for the anechoic chamber and/or RF absorber? Will the basis be minimum MIL-STD 461E reflectivity values or is it desired to have significantly better performance than minimum MIL-STD 461E values? ANSWER 8: MIL-ST D-461E at a minimum. More attenuation is highly desirable. QUESTION 9: Please clarify if the reverberation chamber will be classified as a mode tuned or mode stirred chamber. If mode stirred, is there a desired maximum RPM speed for the paddle assemblies? Is the intent to be able to create both a mode tuned or mode stirred environment? ANSWER 9: Mode Tuned at a minimum. Mode stirred is also desirable. QUESTION 10: Please define or clarify what the acceptance testing criteria will be for the reverberation ch amber. The MIL-STD specification does not address the performance verification (or acceptance testing) criteria. Is it the intent to have the vendor provide performance testing services in line with reasonable and normal practices or do you have specific c riteria you would like for us to follow? ANSWER 10: The basic intent is to provide verification of shielding and operability. The government will want to verify that the reverberation chamber works well (statistically), at several frequencies in its operat ional band. The government will be glad to provide the necessary signal generators, amps, and antennas to aid in the verification process. The government just wants to make sure it works properly before the vendor leaves. The tuners suggested in Annex A (a nd in the diagram for location) of the SOW should provide acceptable performance. The government suggestions in Annex A are always highly recommended based on our experience (but we will not turn down better ideas). QUESTION 11: The completion date for the  project is defined in the RFP, is there a planned award date? This would be helpful to know in combination with the items listed above for resource planning so  we can state with confidence that the facility will be complete and turned over to Redstone by the end of August 2005. ANSWER 11: It is in the best interest that the award date happens as soon as possible after closing, estimating around 30 MAR. QUESTION 12: Bulkheads - General - The contractor is supply blank bulkheads with no connectors or machining for GFE.  Is this assumption correct?  ANSWER 12: Yes  QUESTION 13: Start Date - General - The start date is not specified, only a completion date of 31 Augu st.  What is the anticipated on earliest allow on site start date?  ANSWER 13: As soon as possible after award, on or around 30MAR2005. QUESTION 14: Electrical Filters - General - All 100 Amp filters are assumed to be a single conductor. All 30 amp filters  (or less) are assumed to be a dual conductor. ANSWER 14: Yes on both.  QUESTION 15: Vehicle Exhaust - 1.3.2.5 - Who is to supply the exhaust fan?  If the contractor is expected to supply, is 225 cfm on a 3 inch hose sufficient? Who exhausts from building?   It is clear the contractor is to provide the waveguide to exhaust from the chamber and mode stir area. Are we to supply two, one for each?  ANSWER 15: Exhaust vent just for reverberation chamber as shown in the diagram in the SOW.  The government can sup ply an external fan. QUESTION 16: Non US Citizens - Will non US citizens be permitted on the base?  These citizens will be from Singapore and their name passport will be pre-submitted for a background check, if requested.  ANSWER 16: This office would need  Foreign Disclosure Office clearance for each individual. It would be very difficult in that they will have to be escorted at all times. End User management has stated that they do not have the funds to provide a full-time escort from the time they come in  the Redstone Arsenal gate until they leave. QUESTION 17: Bidding - General - Will partial bid be accepted with exclusions? ANSWER 17: No, partial offers would be non-responsive to the requirement. QUESTION 18: Mode Stir Chamber length - 1.3.2 - Can the mo de stir chamber be increased in length to 44 feet to insure the appropriate test volume, or should we reduce the test volume due to the decrease in the length of the chamber?  ANSWER 18: The government prefers to keep the length down to 42 feet so that we will have enough space in our existing building.  What test volume are you trying to obtain and why? QUESTION 19: Construction - General - Will 3 inch x 3 inch angle structure be allowed inside the control room?  ANSWER 19: Yes, as long as it does not inte rfere with bulkheads, doors, etc. QUESTION 20: Bidding - General What will be the estimated (actual may vary) award date following the bid date?  ANSWER 20: It is in the governments interest to award the contract as soon as possible, estimate around 30MAR 2005. QUESTION 21: Could we bid on the Shielded Control Room (and all its requirements) only?  ANSWER 21: No, partial offers would be non-responsive to the requirement. Question 22: The shielding effectiveness specifications provided are for all chambers. Is the Shielded Control Room considered a chamber and thus required to meet the same shielding effectiveness specs? Or is there a different shielding effectiveness requirement for this room?  Answer 22: Same requirement as the other rooms. QUESTION 23: Sec tion 1.3.3.5 - Anechoic Treatment - RTTC has requested 1 foot absorber for the walls and ceiling on top of ferrite tile. The vendor does not have an absorber material that fits the dimensional criteria and reflective performance in MIL-STD 461E; therefore we would propose our FS-600 hybrid ferrite/anechoic absorber. The overall height of this material is 24 inches. Will this be acceptable?  ANSWER 23: As stated in the SOW Section 1.3.3.5, absorber AND Ferrite tile should be used to get the proper performanc e.  What this means is that ferrite tile would be on the wall (for the lower frequency attenuation), and RF absorber (pyramidal cones for the higher frequencies ) on top of the ferrite tile.  The combined performance should meet the performance requirements.  If the vendor does not have this capability (or has a better idea), then they can propose what they have. The government wanted to limit it to 12 inches to m aximize chamber space. QUESTION 24: Section 1.3.3.5 - Anechoic Treatment - The field strength is listed as 1250 v/m, can you provide the power density required?  Also please confirm whether the field strength is for pulse not continuous wave for MIL-STD 46 1 testing. ANSWER 24: It would typically be pulse.  But since the government calibrates with a CW field and then turns on the pulse, the absorber behind the EUT (back wall) should be able to withstand a 1250V/m CW field. Power Density =(E^2)/377 = 4144 W/( m^2)= 414 mW/cm^2. QUESTION 25: There seems to be a discrepancy in the specification concerning the absorber treatment, in section 1.3.3.5 it states that ferrite is to be used on all walls and ceiling then on page 7 the drawing states ferrite on the doors only. Will we need to provide ferrite tile on all walls and ceiling of the anechoic chamber? ANSWER 25: Per the SOW, everything is lined with the ferrite tile except the floor. Also, everything is lined with the cones (on top of the tile)except the floor a nd door. The government did not want the cones on the door because they would be easily damaged opening and closing. QUESTION 26: On page 7 the drawing indicates that the chambers are to share common walls, the vendor would prefer to have the chambers sepa rated with shielded tunnels between the chambers, the separation between the chambers will be approximately 6 inches. Will this be acceptable?  ANSWER 26: If that is the only way the vendor can do it in a cost effective manner, then the vendor can propose it that way. The government preference in order to maximize space would be to share walls. QUESTION 27: Section 1.3 - Fire Protection/Detection - Will the chamber vendor be responsible for the sprinkles and penetrations only or are we required to provide p iping to the valve provided by RTTC. ANSWER 27: The government will take care of bringing water to the chamber.  The vendor should do the rest. QUESTION 28: It is not clear whether the chamber vendor is required to provide the heat sensors for the detectio n system as these are to be located inside ductwork provided by RTTC, can you clarify who should supply these sensors? ANSWER 28: The vendor should supply the sensors, even though they will be directly outside the chamber in GFE supplied ductwork. QUESTION  29: Reverberation chamber asks for MIL-STD 461E, which requires field uniformity testing, will this be a requirement for RTTC? ANSWER 29: MIL-STD-461E, RS103 does lay out details concern reverberation chambers in Section 5.19.4 (although the government pl ans on going below 200 MHz) and in the Appendix Section 50.19.

For information purposes, the DRAFT Statement of Work will be available online at:   ftp://ftp.mvk.usace.army.mil/pub/MS%20LAKES% 20O&M/MS%20LAKES%20STATEMENT%20OF%20WORK.pdf .   The solicitation number for this announcement is W912EE-05-R-0005.  VCCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and 8(a) small business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation  for operation, maintenance, and repair of flood control facilities managed by the Corps of Engineers at either one or both of the following projects (separate contracts will be awarded for each project): 1.  Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in t he State of Mississippi (MS LAKES) and/or 2. Ouachita, Greeson, and Degray Lakes in the State of Arkansas (ARK LAKES).  Both projects are nearly identical in the type, complexity, and variety of work required.  Only the MS LAKES project Statement of Work i s available online at this time.  The main difference between the two projects is the amount of work required.  The MS LAKES project has historically averaged between $5 and $6 Million per year, while the ARK LAKES project averages between $1.5 to $2.5 Mil lion per year.  Unless otherwise noted, all descriptions below refer to either of the projects.  The NAICS Code for both proposed acquisitions is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $30 M il.  Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, repair/alteration/all other.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as either HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), or small business set-asides.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection proc ess that will result in award of a cost-plus-award-fee contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost considered.  The Government  anticipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements co nsisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or a major subcontractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope and complexity.  Each reference shall include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, contract numbers as well as a description of the services provided, contra ct type (i.e., fixed price or cost), and dollar value.  Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be included.  Respondents must indicate in their cover letter the project for which they are submitting (MS LAKES OR ARK LAKES),  and if for both, only one submittal is required. The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Stateme nt of Work.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will as sist the VCCO in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the result s of the evaluation.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, or 8(a) firms or proceed with competition among all small business firms.  Submissions that do not meet  all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions via email will be accepted, facsimile submissions will not.

<DESC>THIS IS A SORCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVALIABLE.  For information purposes, the DRAFT Statement of Work will be available online at:   ftp://ftp.mvk.usace.army.mil/pub/MS%20LAKES% 20O&M/MS%20LAKES%20STATEMENT%20OF%20WORK.pdf .

VCCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and 8(a) small business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation  for operation, maintenance, and repair of flood control facilities managed by the Corps of Engineers at either one or both of the following projects (separate contracts will be awarded for each project): 1.  Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in t he State of Mississippi (MS LAKES) and/or 2. Ouachita, Greeson, and Degray Lakes in the State of Arkansas (ARK LAKES).  Both projects are nearly identical in the type, complexity, and variety of work required.  Only the MS LAKES project Statement of Work i s available online at this time.  The main difference between the two projects is the amount of work required.  The MS LAKES project has historically averaged between $5 and $6 Million per year, while the ARK LAKES project averages between $1.5 to $2.5 Mil lion per year.  Unless otherwise noted, all descriptions below refer to either of the projects.

The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as either HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), or small business set-asides.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection proc ess that will result in award of a cost-plus-award-fee contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost considered.  The Government  anticipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements co nsisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.

Description
The 75 MSG/PKA office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources interested in performing technical support in support of JOVIAL compilers and software development, maintenance, and testing tools to Air Force users to modernize their aircraft and systems.  JOVIAL is a legacy programming language developed by and for the Air Force of use in embedded flight systems, most notably the MIL-STD-1750A processor.  The majority of fielded flight systems continue to use programs written and maintained in JOVIAL and the Jovial Program Office (JPO) provides a written standardization complement of development tools known as the Integration Tool Set (ITS).   Over the past 20 years, the JPO acquired distribution rights, instead of source rights from Software Engineering Associates, Inc (SEA) to augment the ITS in support of expanding the reusability and applicability for legacy systems within the Air Force and other DOD agencies.  These tools permit Air Force organization to comply with DoD policy to reuse legacy flight systems to reduce cost and avoid new development efforts.  Central to this effort has been the ability of the JPO to acquire unrestricted distribution rights to many of SEA’s corporate (COTS) JOVIAL compliers hosted and targeted to various legacy processors and new COTS processors being used as replacements on various sustainment projects.  These acquisitions have permitted the JPO to supply standardization, virtually cost-free support software and development environments to multiple program offices hereby reducing the overall cost to the Air Force for mission critical improvement projects.  

All potential sources are asked to submit capability packages expressing their interest based on the description above. The capabilities package must be clear and concise, complete and limited to no more that twenty (20) pages in length, and shall include as a minimum: (1) name and address of firm; size/ownership of business, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8a, disabled-veteran, veteran, woman owned business, and hub zone; (2) number of years in business; (3) a point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and email; (4) cage code and duns number (if available) (5) identification if you are a GSA schedule holder, affiliate contractor (if potential sub), or subcontractors (if potential prime); (6) experience and familiarity with providing the needed services; past performance experience (needs to be recent) providing similar services to include contract number, contract type, contract value, period of performance, POC and telephone number.

<DESC>PLEASE VISIT WWW.HERBB.HANSCOM.AF.MIL TO DOWNLOAD THE RFI RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION.  NOTE 26 Applies. THE CPSG IS EMBARKING ON A MAJOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (CM) PROGRAM FOR SPACE TELEMETRY, TRACKING AND CONTROL (TT&C).  THE CPSG PLANS A SERIES OF SPIRAL DEVELOPMENTS TO INCREMENTALLY FIELD A NEW TT&C INFORMATION ASSURANCE (IA) ARCHITECTURE.  ONE OF CPSG'S FIRST PRIORITIES IS TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMABLE FLIGHT COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY (COMSEC) SOLUTIONS. PROGRAMMABLE SOLUTIONS WILL ENABLE SPACE SYSTEM DEVELOPERS TO RESPOND TO CHANGING THREATS, VULNERABILITIES, RISKS, RELEASABILITY, INTEROPERABILITY, AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS WITHOUT DEVELOPING NEW HARDWARE.  IN THE FIRST SPIRAL DEVELOPMENT, THE CPSG ANTICIPATES ACQUIRING AN INVENTORY OF DEVICES THAT WOULD BE PROGRAMMED FOR A SPECIFIC APPLICATION WHEN THE DEVICE(S) IS PREPARED FOR INTEGRATION INTO A SPACECRAFT.  SUBSEQUENT SPIRALS WILL INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL CM CAPABILITIES INTO TT&C COMSEC.  THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP AND PROCURE A FLIGHT TT&C COMSEC SOLUTION.  THE HARDWARE ELEMENT OF THE SOLUTION MUST NOT BE APPLICATION SPECIFIC, BUT MUST BE ABLE TO BE PROGRAMMED FOR SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS (COMMAND OR TELEMETRY) AND ALGORITHMS (CARDHOLDER OR PEGASUS) UPON SELECTION FOR A SPECIFIC APPLICATION/MISSION. SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE EMBEDDED IN SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SUBSYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED.  THE CPSG ALSO PLANS TO DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE A STANDALONE END CRYPTOGRAPHIC UNIT (ECU) THAT IS BASED UPON THE EMBEDDED SOLUTION.  THIS EFFORT INCLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH THE PROGRAMMABLE SOLUTION (E.G. HARDWARE) AND THE PROGRAMMING TO BE LOADED INTO THE SOLUTION (E.G. SOFTWARE).  A DRAFT TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT IS BEING PREPARED TO DEFINE THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE ENVELOPE, AND WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR INDUSTRY REVIEW IN APPROXIMATELY 30 DAYS.  See Note 26.

The smaller diameter end of the shaft is bent at a 56 degree angle and its centerline (at the end) offset 5.68 inches from the centerline of the 3 inch diameter.  This may create balance/interference issues if the shaft is spun.  There is a 4.25 in deep centerline hole in the 3 inch end with 1-12 UNF-3B threads that may be used for fixturing though care must be taken not to damage the threads.  Interested vendors/suppliers may obtain a copy of the drawing (73D011005) from the USA buyer (L. Williams) identified herein.

This RFI is for information and planning purposes, and the objective is:  (1) to invite potential sources to submit information that allows USA to conduct a technical assessment of capabilities and qualifications, and (2) to promote a best value competition.  This preliminary information does not constitute an RFP, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by USA to enter into a subcontract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications:  USA invites potential sources to submit a Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document that will allow USA to conduct an assessment of capabilities and qualifications.	The Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document shall be no more than five (5) pages (8.5” x 11”) in length.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is seeking potential sources to prototype a Multi-purpose Reconfigurable Training System (MRTS) to support IUSS maintenance training conducted by Submarine Learning Facility (SUBLRNFAC) Norfolk Virginia.  Developmental work will be at contractor facilities with installation at SUBLRNFAC Norfolk Virginia.  A $200,000 - $250,000 Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the MRTS and one scenario with a one-year period of performance is anticipated. The option for four more scenarios will be included in the contract. Details regarding this requirement are provided in the paragraphs that follow.

The Government requires the following services for the IUSS Maintenance MRTS:  
	
1)	Hardware.  The MRTS hardware shall consist of one cabinet and a separate student station. The cabinet shall be used to simulate the operational equipment using 3D graphics and touch screens for user interface and shall contain an instructor console for controlling the scenario(s). The cabinet shall be configured with two vertical racks housing eight (8) flat panel touch screen displays, four (4) per rack. The cabinet shall contain an instructor console consisting of a keyboard and mouse and shall share the use of one of the flat panel touch screen displays.  The cabinet shall contain three computer systems, two of which shall provide the graphics displayed and touch screen interactions on the 8 flat panel touch screen displays.  The third computer shall be used to set-up and monitor the scenario for the student station and cabinet via the instructor console.  The student station shall consist of a single PC with three monitors that shall emulate the Control Monitor and Maintenance (CMM) console used by the Duty Maintenance Technician (DMT) to monitor, initialize and reconfigure the system. The student station will be used for trouble shooting and fault isolation. Once the fault is isolated, the student will use the cabinet to perform the corrective maintenance.  Additional cabinets may be added in the future.

2)	Instructional Systems Development (ISD).  The contractor shall develop the scenario using Government Furnished Information (GFI) and proven instructional design concepts.  The following handbooks will be used for guidance:

·	MIL-HDBK-2912-2, DoD Handbook, Instructional Systems Development/Systems Approach to Training and Education, provides guidance on the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process and the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of instruction and instructional materials.  

·	MIL-HDBK-29612-3 provides guidance that may be used by DoD (all Services) and industry for the planning, design, development, implementation, evaluation, and management of Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) products.

 
3)	Scenario – The scenario is very complex but a brief description is provided below to help determine the level of effort required.
·	The student receives a fault condition at the Student Station for an operational Watch Display.
·	From the Student Station, the student troubleshoots the system.
·	Once the faulty card is identified at the Student Station, the student then gets up and removes the faulty card from the cabinet using the touch screens to simulate opening the cabinet, finding the correct card and pulling it.
·	Next, the student replaces the card, closes up the cabinet and then returns to the Student Station to confirm that the problem has been fixed.

In order to develop this scenario the contractor will have to emulate the CMM software covering all the options that would normally be available to the technician.  Wrong paths can be stubbed out and feedback provided to the students telling them what they did wrong and that they should try again. In order to simulate the hardware the contractor will have to photograph all the equipment and make 3D models of the components the student will be interacting with.

4)	Media Development – The contractor shall develop all the media necessary to complete the scenario.  These include 2D-Stills, 3D-Stills, 3D-Animations, and movies.  At least one site visit shall be required in order to photograph the operational equipment.  All software shall become the property of the government upon final acceptance.  The contractor shall deliver all source code for the developed software to the government upon final acceptance.

5)	Training Device Installation – The contractor shall install the trainer, with NAVAIR assistance, at SUBLRNFAC Norfolk Virginia and provide on-site training. The training shall include maintenance and well as operator training.

6)	Security Requirements – The trainer, its software, and the scenarios will be unclassified; however, the developers will require a security clearance, at the Secret level, in order to obtain access to the operational equipment for research and taking photographs. 

Businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit the following:
1)	Company literature, brochures, or capability summaries.
2)	Business size (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, etc).  For purposes of reporting business size, the applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 333319 with a size standard of 500.  Please identify business size on cover sheet or first page of submission.
3)	Past and/or current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact information).  Please limit past and/or current performance to the last 3 years.

Information should be sent via e-mail to the cognizant Contract Specialist, Ruth Hinton, at Ruth.hinton@navy.mil. Alternative submittal methods are via facsimile to (407) 380-4742 or by mail to:  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, ATTN:  Code 25332 (Ruth Hinton), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275.  Responses are requested on or before 31 MARCH 2005.  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  The Government anticipates issuing a draft Statement of Work at a later date for industry comment.  Prior to issuance of any draft documents, the Government will post an announcement on FedBizOpps located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The United States Mint requires Contractor support to perform assays on a statistically significant number of gold samples taken from gold bullion stored in vaults at the United States Mint.  Failure through this notice to locate additional qualified sources for the work set forth herein may result in the sole source award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract with a period of performance of five years to Ledoux and Company of 359 Alfred Avenue, Teaneck, NJ  07666.

The selected Contractor shall perform assays on samples of gold (United States Mint Furnished Property) weighing approximately 0.1 gross troy ounces each.  Gold samples will be “high fine grade” with a 99.95% or higher level of purity.  The assay tests on the samples shall be conducted as blind tests, with no further information than that provided above.  At minimum, the Contractor shall report the gold content of each sample, expressed as a percentage, using a format of at least a four digits with at least two digits beyond the decimal point (i.e. 99.95%).

Batches of samples will be shipped via registered mail to the selected Contractor at different times during the year.  In past years, the United States Mint sent batches of 70 to 150 samples at a time and this trend is expected to continue through the next several years.  However, it is possible that a much larger batch of samples could be provided all at once during the period of the contract.  The Contractor shall be notified at least five (5) working days in advance of samples being shipped.  The Contractor shall complete the assay testing and reporting of any batch containing 150 samples or less within 15 business days.  For each additional 25 samples in the batch, the contractor shall be allowed 2 additional business days to complete the assay testing and reporting.

If a formal solicitation is issued, the competing vendors will be asked to propose assay testing of the samples using any assay method or any combination of assay methods conducted in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) guidelines.  The vendors shall fully explain in their technical proposals how they intend to process the samples, which ASTM approved assay testing method (or methods) will be employed, and the extent of destruction to the sample (if any) each assay method is expected to cause.  The selected Contractor’s proposed assay method may be incorporated into the Performance Work Statement for the contract.  

For the purposes of this notice, all responding vendors are requested to describe the laboratory or facilities they have available within the continental United States for conducting this work, and, their experience in performing the identical work.  Interested vendors that can meet the requirements should respond by sending an email message to the United States Mint point of contact set forth herein.  All work under this contract shall be performed within the continental United States.

The United States Mint is contemplating the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract with a period of performance of five years for the effort.  Pricing for individual task orders under the contract shall be based upon the number of samples included in a batch of samples submitted for testing.  

Provisions of law governing procurement or public contracts shall not be applicable to the procurement of goods or services necessary for carrying out United States Mint programs and operations.  See 31 U.S.C. § 5136.

The forum will concentrate on Request for Proposal (RFP) Development, Proposal Submission, Post-Award Design and Post-Award Construction.  Discussion of specific contract actions or procurements in progress will be limited, as needed, to appropriately preserve procurement integrity and business sensitive information.  Otherwise, we welcome an open exchange, and we are very interested in having you participate and share your views.  Due to space constraints, attendance will be limited, so we are requesting that no more than two participants from your firm attend.  Also, priority for attending will first be given to those organizations currently under large multiple award contracts with Southern Division NAVFAC, and other contractors will be considered on a space availability basis.  To receive a Forum Invitation and register to attend contact the Forum Coordinator Shaun Demattio email:  shaun.demattio@navy.mil or fax (843) 820-5969 by close of business on 23 February 2005.

INTEGRATED CORRIDOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS INITIATIVE; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
AGENCIES: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), USDOT.
ACTION: Notice; Request For Information.
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is seeking information from all sources for its Integrated Corridor Management Systems (ICM) initiative. The ICM initiative is one of the nine major initiatives recently launched by the USDOT’s Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program to improve transportation safety, and enhance mobility and productivity.
	Integrated Corridor Management is the coordination of individual network operations between adjacent facilities (e.g., freeway and transit) that creates an interconnected system capable of cross network travel management. The USDOT’s vision is that metropolitan areas will realize significant improvements in the efficient movement of people and goods through effective and proactive integration and management of major transportation corridors. Integrated Corridor Management will result in a reduction of delays, fuel consumption, emissions, and incidents, and an increase in reliability and predictability of travel. The ultimate goal of the ICM initiative is to provide the institutional guidance, operational capabilities, and ITS technology and technical methods needed for effective Integrated Corridor Management Systems.
	The ICM initiative will identify and close key knowledge gaps in integrated corridor management. The initiative will demonstrate through a successful deployment of corridor management systems how ITS technologies can be used efficiently and proactively to optimally utilize existing corridor capacity through a coordinated effort by the corridor agencies. The initiative will disseminate to the transportation community the information and tools it needs to deploy integrated corridor operations.
	For more information on the ICM initiative, please refer the Integrated Corridor Management Systems Program Plan and the Integrated Corridor Management Systems Vision, in Appendices A and B, respectively. The documents and information on the initiative may also be viewed at www.itsa.org/icm.html.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION	
Federal Highway Administration
NEXT GENERATION 9 1 1 INITIATIVE; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
AGENCIES: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT).
ACTION: Notice; request for information.
SUMMARY: The USDOT is seeking comments from all sources (public, private, governmental, academic, professional, public interest groups, and other interested parties) on the Next Generation 9 1 1 (NG9 1 1) Initiative.  The NG9 1 1 Initiative is being established as a major new component of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program.  
	9 1 1 is an essential part of USDOT’s safety and mobility missions.  However, based on decades old technology, the Nation’s 9 1 1 system cannot now handle the text, data, images, and video that are increasingly common in personal communications and critical to future transportation safety and mobility advances.  The intent of the NG9 1 1 Initiative is to establish the foundation for public emergency services in a wireless mobile society and ultimately enable enhanced 9 1 1 (E9 1 1) with most types of communication devices.  
	To accomplish this, the USDOT intends to work closely with public and private 9 1 1 stakeholders during the next three years to produce a national framework and deployment plan for an NG9 1 1 System.  The purpose of this document is to solicit comments on the approach, to obtain expressions of interest in participating as partners, and to request responses to specific questions provided in this document.  This is neither a request for proposals nor an invitation for bids.
DATES: It is requested that comments on this announcement be submitted by May 1, 2005.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

Confer with Military Facilitator and recommend learning alternatives when appropriate (i.e. open study, lesson review, additional practice lessons). Technical specialist may provide Level 1 and Level 2 student intervention. Level 1 - Intervention is when a learner requests support from the Military Facilitator or technical specialist. Level 2 - Intervention is when a learner’s progress is 3 or more days behind projections, an enhanced level of intervention is required. In extreme cases, the facilitator may utilize one or more of the following options:  Learning Resource Center (LRC), remote learning CD, laptop checkout, mentored assistance in LRC. Level 3 - Intervention is when a learner is unable to maintain acceptable progress due to non-academic reasons.  Military facilitators will handle this situation. 4.

A kick off meeting will be held at the start of the transition period to discuss the Navy’s self-paced learning environment and the contract requirements for ATT facilitation.  During the transition period, the Government will coordinate with the incoming contractor and the outgoing contractor to ensure an orderly transition and minimize any impact on training and readiness of the classroom and classroom equipment.  The Government will coordinate with the outgoing contactor to provide the incoming contractor with access to the site, material, and equipment; allow the incoming contractor's facilitators to attend the course as a student (if necessary); and allow the contractor's personnel to observe the performance (over the shoulder) of all required tasks on a not to interfere basis. Period of Performance: 7-Month Base Period and four consecutive twelve-month Option Periods.  Responsibility and Inspection: Unless otherwise specified in the order, the supplier is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.

Quoters shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3 ALT I with quotes. Additional applicable contract terms and conditions are: 252.212-7000 and 252.212-7001, including 52.203-3, 252.232-7003 and 252.243-7002; 52.212-2--the award will be based on an evaluation of past performance and price. U.S. DOL, Wage Determination Nos. 94-3024 (Rev 15) and 94-2116 (Rev 16) apply. Any exceptions to the SOW may result in an unacceptable quote. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price type purchase order to the eligible, responsible quoter whose quotation represents the best value considering both past performance and price with past performance more important than price. PAST PERFORMANCE: The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the item description herein, performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (name, phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quotation. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quotation of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quotation to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quotation when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government determines are most relevant to the RFQ. Oral quotations are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All quotations shall include a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. Responses to this notice are required, in writing, by 24 February 2005, and shall be mailed to Anita Spriggs, Code 204.21E, 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 2B, FISC Norfolk, Contracting Dept., Phila. Div., Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083; faxed to (215) 697-5418; or emailed to anita.spriggs@navy.mil. Quotations over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile. All responsible sources may submit a quotation for consideration. See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The above reference solicitation is hereby amended to respond to a technical questions submitted.

The due date for quotations, February 17, 2005 at 3:00 PM Local Time, remains unchanged.

QUESTION: The statement below is from the distributor of the media you are requesting, please clarify your request for â€œWatertight lidsâ€.  I do want to point out one part of the rfq that needs attention. Our standard 55 gallon steel drums come with locking lids. They are not however "watertight" as requested.  One alternative is to offer polylined hazardous waste drums. While we CANNOT guarantee these will be watertight we believe they will resist water better than standard drums.

RESPONSE:  The definition of Solicitation Number SB1341-05-Q-0315, Line Item 0001 paragraph (9) PACKAGING - Water tight lids, a removable steel lid, capable of being stored in an area exposed to weather, not to allow rain or melting snow to make contact with the S780 Steel Shot. Locking rings are used to hold the removable steel lids to the 55-gallon drums.

As to the alternative polylined hazardous waste drums, this is totally unacceptable, due to the fact that NIST heats the steel shot in ovens.
