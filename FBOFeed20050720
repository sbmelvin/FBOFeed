<DESC>NOTE:  In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law.  Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of Government works.  Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future projects should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry.  They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.  The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andalucia.  The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract to Repair Apron Lights 1,2& 3.  Contract magnitude is between $100,000 and $250,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contracting officer, thomas.finch@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.  However, remember that the notification of changes that result from registration is only a service and any failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government in any way, shape, or form.  Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made.  As a last resort, if you cannot download the pre-solicitation from the EPS internet site, we will provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide two working day notice (workdays are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above e-mail address or via fax at 95 584 8054.  The Government anticipates and reserves the right to issue all solicitation documents including specifications and drawings in the English language only.  A visit to the site of work will be conducted in English; the date and time of which will be announced in the solicitation documents.  In order to be awarded a contract by the U.S. Government in excess of $25,000, the company must have a DATA UNIVERSAL NUMBERING SYSTEM (DUNS) NUMBER.  If you do not already have one, it is suggested you contact Dunn and Bradstreet at www.dnb.com/dunsno/whereduns.htm or www.dun.es/.  Failure to have a DUNS Number at the time of award may delay the award, and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified offeror who has a valid DUNS Number.  All contractors are advised that they shoudl be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/.  NOTE:  You must have a DUNS Number to register.  Furthermore, in accordance with Section L, Provision L-204, a COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY (CAGE) CODE REPORTING is required.  You can obtain a CAGE Code by submitting your request via e-mail to cagemail@dlis.dla.mil, or fax at 616-961-5305; however, do not delay submitting your proposal pending receipt of a DUNS Number or CAGE Code.

A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database. If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov, Business Commercial Opportunities, Navigate to, Scroll down to Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  
Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 
Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR 
record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Air Handling System Improvements IMO23990 at Federal Building No. 2, Bannister Complex, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, 64131, Solicitation Number GS06P05GZC0011.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents prepared by an architect/engineer through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000.  The contract length shall be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Government, but shall not exceed 24 months 730 calendar days after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about September 16, 2005.  This procurement will be completed using a two-step source selection process. This contract is restricted only to those firms having an existing design, construction and/or design/build contracting office within the bi-state Kansas City region defined by the Mid-America Regional Council MARC as the Kansas counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray. Such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this announcement.   Federal Building No. 2 of the Bannister Complex, which was built in 1942, has 197,410 usable square feet of office space. It consists of a basement and two levels above ground and has approximately 1,535 employees. The fan houses and air distribution equipment were added to the building around 1960.  The HVAC system consists of air handling units in fan houses located on the roof that distribute air to a major portion of the building, plus packaged air handling units that serve spaces with special needs and/or spaces mostly in the basement that were lacking in airflow from the fan house system.  The existing overall HVAC system is not energy efficient due to the use of old, inefficient equipment and the use of smaller, low efficiency, packaged units.  The existing fan house systems are in need of repair and renovation.  The supply and return fans and motors for the fan house air handling units are inefficient and inadequate in capacity to meet the airflow and static pressure requirements of the system.  The existing configuration of supply air ducts does not provide good air distribution to the entire building since not enough air velocity is maintained to force the air to the end of the system.  The scope of work includes the following: 1. Installation of five 5 new roof-top variable air volume, direct digital control, air-handling units to replace existing units. System should be equipped with a fixed supply-air temperature.  2. Removal of all penthouse fan equipment and modification of ductwork to accommodate new roof-mounted packaged air handling equipment. 3. Sealing of all chase penetrations and openings; relocating any obstructions to airflow in the chases; installing fire dampers and access panels; installing fire-rated enclosures; and replacing control valves, steam traps, strainers and roll filter media in the fan house units. Addition of medium-pressure ductwork in existing vertical chases. 4. Replacement of all existing horizontal supply ductwork on the roof with new ductwork. 5. Provision of outside air to existing packaged units located throughout the building. 6. Relocation of existing ground level air intakes to the roof. 7. Removal of existing air handling units in basement and on first floor and connection of areas served to building distribution system.  8. Replacement of outdoor air damper and actuator.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed after regular business hours.  The request for proposals RFP solicitation will be issued on or about April 12, 2005.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS.  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch 6PCA, will no longer mail hardcopies of the solicitation and amendments.  The solicitation specifications and it’s amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR www.ccr.gov and then with FEDTeDS www.fedteds.gov.  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry www.fedbizopps.gov but the sensitive but unclassified acquisitions related information specifications will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about April 28, 2005 at the GSA Office, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri.  GSA will receive proposals on or about May 12, 2005.  Date and time will be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal will be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will use the tradeoff process method of evaluation in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating technical factors and price, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage One will be technical evaluations of proposals to establish those who are most technically qualified.  Stage Two will be receipt of pricing and scheduling. Stage One technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in descending order of importance:  1. Past performance of the firm; 2. Experience and qualifications of key personnel; 3. Management plan; and 4. Team composition, organization and prior experience as a design-build team.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the best value, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 39% total for Small Business SB, which includes 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business SDB; 5% for Woman-Owned Small Business WOSB, 3% for Hub Zone Small Business; HZSB; 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business VOSB; and 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business SDVOSB.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Mike Flanigan, Contract Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4912 or fax him at 816-926-3517.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Jean Dodd, at 816-926-1174.

This cooperative agreement will establish a Space Robotics Institute, in which the University of Maryland’s role will be to a) apply their unique and extensive experience in dexterous space robotics, satellite assembly and servicing, machine vision, microelectronics and optoelectronics fabrication, and space flight hardware development, to develop gap-filling technologies for dexterous space robotics through breadboard validation, b) perform environmental testing for these technologies using their unique laboratory facilities for thermal, vacuum, and accelerated life tests, etc., c) integrate these technologies into their unique system-level dexterous robot testbeds (1-g and neutral buoyancy) and perform high-fidelity performance measurements for the integrated systems, and d) quantify and report on the resulting robot capabilities for use in NASA programs.  The cooperative agreement will also allow for the formation of university and industry partnerships to provide best-in-class key technologies and capabilities that are needed to satisfy the objectives of the cooperative agreement.  The University of Maryland’s Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) is uniquely qualified to perform these dexterous space robotics technology efforts based on their specialized expertise obtained from numerous related research projects, including the Ranger Telerobotic Shuttle Experiment.   In addition, the University of Maryland SSL possesses unique facilities for development and testing of space qualified robotic technologies, including their Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility, which allows the long-term simulation of the microgravity environment of orbital flight,  and other specialized tools for analyzing robot architectures. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See note 26 and note 22.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on the response date listed above. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of ! proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWCPC) intends to issue a sole source contract to BriarTek Incorporated, 112 East Delray Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia to install and validate Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems on 27 US Navy ships.  This contract also includes personnel training.  The objective of this effort is to outfit each ship with a system capable of alerting the crew of a man overboard event so that a life saving rescue can be executed.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The USN has been evaluating Commercial Off The Shelf, Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems since FY99.  Based upon results of multiple  Field Demonstration Tests, the USN has decided to purchase and install MOBI systems on all USN ships.   The MOBI system manufactured by BriarTek is the only system capable of transmitting a unique code that identifies the specific transmitter that has been activated.   This unique code eli! minates confusion during instances when multiple personnel are thrown overboard simultaneously and will aid in identifying which individuals are still in the water and in need of rescue.  Because of this unique code, BriarTek Incorporated is the only company that can meet all of the US Navy requirements.  Additionally, this effort is sole source because NSWC PC has awarded three previous contracts (including contract N61331-04-F-1131) to install the BriarTek-manufacuted MOBI system on a total of 146 ships thus far.  This contract is for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development and deployment of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. NAICS!  Code 334220 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees. FSC is 6320.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to procure on a sole source basis, publication by Oxford University Press, 2001 Evens Road, Cary, NC 27513, of Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) Monograph on HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN).  This acquisition is being procured under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees. Background: The CRN seeks to improve the effectiveness of preventive, curative, and supportive interventions for both major cancers such as breast, colon, lung, and rare tumors. The CRN is also uniquely positioned to study the quality of cancer care in community-based settings. As a reflection of its commitment to improving quality of care, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is cooperatively supporting the CRN with the NCI. During its 6 years of operation the CRN has made substantial progress in achieving its goals of  developing resources to support research designed to improve the effectiveness of cancer prevention and treatment by identifying system, provider, treatment and patient factors that affect outcomes; develop standardized approaches to data collection, data management and analysis for health systems based cancer control research; increase collaboration between CRN sites and with investigators at NCI and academic centers; enhance the ability of CRN to respond to NCI priority questions related to rare cancers, the diffusion of innovations in cancer care into practice and the role of health services; evaluate and improve CRN’s performance. A monograph describing CRN research results to date, the development of CRN’s data and other research resources and an assessment of how CRN functions as a multi-site healthcare delivery based research network was proposed. The proposal for a JNCI monograph on the HMO Cancer Research Network was accepted by the JNCI editor.  The JNCI was acquired by the Oxford University Press. The scope of work will include managing the review of manuscripts, copy editing, and publishing “HMO Cancer Research Network” as a Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monograph.  Period of Performance:  One year from the date of issuance. Oxford University Press is the only appropriate contractor for fulfilling the objectives of this market requisition.  Oxford University Press has acquired the JNCI.  Oxford University Press is the only known source to the NCI that can reach the intended audience and regularly publishes this type of monograph.  No other cancer and health services research-oriented journal provides a comparable publication.  The JNCI is one of the most prestigious and widely read publications devoted to cancer research so that the manuscripts included in the monograph are likely to have a very wide audience among health services researchers and users of the HMO CRN data. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are not authorized. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on August 3, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. It is the contractor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Marlow Industries, Inc under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The Government requires six-stage thermoelectric coolers.  These six-stage thermoelectric coolers are custom designed for the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) Infrared detector.  These devices are identical copies to the ones that Marlow has previously successfully produced and qualified. Marlow has already developed and built the custom tooling required to complete this job. These parts are critical to the successful operation of the WFC3. Therefore, having another manufacturer provide the same parts would require new tooling, a more extensive qualification and life test program, and additional schedule risk. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part  12 & 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. e.s.t time on the response date listed above.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for an UPGRADE TO A 100-KIP CRYOGENIC TEST FRAME: Item #1 Extend the columns to the 100 -KIP CRYOGENTIC TEST FRAME QTY: 2 EA, Item #2 Provide Training on Materials Test Systems (MTS) Test Equipment (MTS FlexTest SE system, MTS Multipurpose TestWare application for general purpose testing, MTS TestWorks 4 application for tensile testing, and MTS Fatigue and Fracture testing applications) QTY: 1 LOT, Item #3 TestWorks 4 Software, QTY 1 EA, and Item #4 Digital Control Systems, QTY: 1 LOT.	 The hardware portion of the procurement is to extend the existing 10 foot long column and lift cylinders by 24 inches.  MTS is the original manufacturer of this equipment and has the design requirements on file.  The software/controller portion consists of MTS FlexTest Controllers, and three computers with factory installed software.  The third portion of the procurement is an on-site four-day training class for the controllers/software required for learning the new functions on these controllers as well as existing controllers purchased last year.	  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Materials Test Systems, Cummings, GA.  This is an upgrade to existing MTS equipment.   MSFC is striving to maintain a level of compatibility and uniformity with its existing systems.  Utilizing software and controllers that are not compatible with existing equipment will result in significantly higher costs and additional time spent by MSFC to perform tests.	Also, utilizing compatible components will reduce the potential for errors when conducting the required tests.   MTS controllers/software have been found to be the most reliable and accurate products available for the type of testing performed on this type of testing machinery.	There are no known sources other than MTS that can supply the controllers/software which have the level of accuracy necessary to satisfy the Government’s testing requirements.  “Accuracy” in this instance refers to the capability of the equipment to consistently perform repetitive tests within very low operational tolerance/accuracy limits established for the tests.   This upgrade will be a drop-in type upgrade configured by the manufacturer of the original equipment, MTS Systems Corporation. The items included in this upgrade are existing MTS designs that fit and are configured to operate MTS equipment.  MTS Systems Corporation is the manufacturer and sole distributor of the proposed equipment and only sells direct to the customer. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 26, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s Emergency Response Team in Las Vegas, Nevada, requires a Hand-Held XRF Soil Analyzer System featuring a miniature X-ray tube, high-resolution system.  The XRF analyzer will be used to conduct on-site analyses in support of the cleanup of the nation?s contaminated land, water, and air.  Specifically, the analyzer is needed to analyze metals to assess potential environmental hazards associated with site assessments and emergency responses.          Due to the nature of the EPA site assessments, the instrument must have the ability to calibrate to matrices other than soil if necessary.  Additionally, the instrument must have the flexibility to add analytes in the field by direct operator activation in the field without connection to an ancillary computer and without intervention/assistance from the supplier/manufacturer.  The analyzer shall be provided with an airline approved shipping case that is able to be shipped via overnight delivery.  The instrument shall also be capable of analyzing for lead in paint.  A HUD approved package is preferred.        The handheld XRF analyzer shall feature: miniature X-ray tube; high-resolution detector system (<250 eV FWHM at 5.95 keV Mn spectral line); two (2) Li-ion batteries; battery charger; waterproof, rugged carrying case; calibration standards; standardization reference sample; Microsoft ActiveSync software for automatic transfer of data to Desktop PC; integrated pocket PC providing data download capability plus direct, touch screen entry of sample information; factory authorized start-up training and assistance; 2-year warranty on parts and labor (batteries and iPAQ pocket PC excluded from factory warranty).         The system shall be able to quantitatively analyze 20 Standard Elements (calibrated) in soil: Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, Hg, and Pb.  Additional (calibrated) elements to be added are: P, S, Cl, K, Ca, V, Br, Ru, I, W, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Tl, Bi, Pr, Ce, La, U and any additional elements that are available when ordered.  The instrument shall have the ability to qualitatively analyze for all elements that it is not quantitatively calibrated for (elements 15 through 92) in any mode (soil, filter, or dust wipe) by direct operator activation in the field without connection to an ancillary computer and without intervention/assistance from the supplier/manufacturer.         The supplier/manufacturer shall provide a list of overlap/interference elements with correction factors if known for the instrument.  (This would be the case for the rare earth metals.)  An additional two (2) iPAQs shall be provided for a total of three (3) being provided to accommodate instrument calibration.       The solicitation will be available on or about August 1, 2005.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed-price contract on a best value basis.  Evaluation of proposals will consider price as well as the demonstrated ability of the system to meet or exceed the Government?s minimum requirements.  It is estimated that proposals will be required within 15 calendar days of solicitation issuance.  The complete solicitation will be downloadable from the EPA/OAM/CPOD website at the following address: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

NAFINSA is a development banking institution that promotes the overall development and modernization of the industrial sector in Mexico.  The progress made by NAFINSA over the past year has created a more direct approach to increasing the financing of Energy Service Companies (ESCO’s) throughout Mexico.  By promoting the development of this sector in Mexico, U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will assist in the creation of a new financial market within Mexico as well as the opportunity for greater investment in energy efficient technologies, a sector in which the U.S. is highly competitive. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $100,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

<CONTACT>Diane Coger, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-2583, Fax 301-443-5462, Email dcoger@hrsa.gov
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the Center for Aging and Healthcare in West Virginia, Inc. (CAHWV), 517 Market Street, DILS Center, Parkersburg, WV  26101, to support and extended analysis of the data from the demonstration of chronic diseases self-management model to determine if rural/urban differences exists and are maintained over time from rural populations.

The analysis concentrates on three chronic conditions with a high prevalence in rural areas:  heart disease, functional disability, and cognitive disability.  The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) has a mission to improve access, delivery of care, and health status for rural Americans.  ORHP has supported prior research that showed that models of care which work well in urban areas do not work as well in rural areas.  Sometimes the urban models do not work at all.  This is because of the limited number of physicians, specialists, and tertiary care hospitals in rural areas and problems with transportation to care (long distances, rough terrain, poor roads, and bad winter weather).  To assure the successful application and continued positive outcomes of chronic disease self-management model for rural America, it is essential to conduct an analysis to compare results over time for rural places to those for urban places.  The focus is on three chronic conditions with high prevalence in rural areas:  heart disease, functional disability, and cognitive disability.  The comparison can identify changes in the model to improve its operation in rural areas. It is important to ensure that the model results in the rural elderly maintaining positive outcomes because of the greater demand in rural areas for care for persons with chronic diseases. This is because elderly persons have a greater rate of chronic diseases and comprise a larger portion of the rural population than they do of the urban population.  Furthermore, the Program Assessment Response Tool (PART) process for ORHP has a long range goal of reducing limitations caused by chronic conditions.  Because the focus of this analysis is on chronic disease, the results will assist ORHP in meeting its long range PART goal. 

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is 6 months.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file. HRSA’s target audiences are particular rural persons with heart disease, functional disability and cognitive disability. Any other organization, other than Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), would have to duplicate the 1994 demonstration funded by CMS mentioned above. To duplicate this demonstration, CMS would have to agree to fund the services out of the Medicare trust fund as they cost several million dollars.  Therefore, CAHWV, with exclusive rights to the data, is the only organization that can conduct the analyses requested in this scope of work.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting a capability statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the services without incurring substantial cost duplication. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Henley Center, West Palm Beach.

Purpose:

The substance misuse and dependency field for older adults across the U.S. is still in its infancy. Moreover, efforts to coordinate treatment of addiction and co-occurring disorders among this population are virtually nonexistent. Today as much as 17 percent of the older adult population misuse and abuse alcohol and medication(s),  The prevalence of addiction and substance dependency among older adults is reflected in the newly-released short report entitled “Older Adults in Substance Abuse Treatment: Update {SAMHSA, Office of Applied Studies, May 2005)  
Health professionals and specialists in the field are increasingly conscious of the pervasiveness of substance abuse among older adults.   Accordingly, SAMHSA Administrator Curie has made older adults a priority at SAMHSA; the agency is working to advance understanding of the relationship between aging and substance use disorders, and to provide practical information for incorporating our understanding into treatment services.  

There is a compelling need to provide support to initiatives and activities that focus upon the substance use disorder treatment needs of older Americans. 
The second National Aging and Addiction Conference will respond to the stated needs of its 2005 participants by retaining the two-day, professional/recovery format, and include breakout sessions on a choice of related topics. The conference will feature national experts in aging and addiction, as well as a well-known personality in recovery.

Hanley Center, of West Palm Beach, FL has been a pioneer organization in outreach, service and program development as each relates to older adults and their substance use disorder needs.  Further, the Center has previously proven its ability to deliver high-quality conference sessions which convey specialized and useful information to the growing population of Americans ages 55 and older.
The second National Aging and Addiction Conference will respond to the stated needs of its 2005 participants by retaining the two-day, professional/recovery format, and include breakout sessions on a choice of related topics.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to procure under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award for “Ratings of Medicare Managed Care Contractors.”  The purpose of the Medicare Advantage Group’s (MAG’s) Financial Watchlist Project is to predict when a Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO) may be at risk for leaving the program, either because the MAO no longer complies with the State’s requirements for fiscal soundness or has unprofitable or limited Medicare beneficiary enrollment.  The MAG Financial Watchlist Project monitors the financial condition of the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs).  Ratings concerning the ability of the MAOs to meet, and of their parent organizations to assist in meeting, their obligations to their enrollees are necessary to support this project. State regulatory agencies use ratings to help determine when a MAO should be analyzed as to whether it continues to meet state requirements for fiscal soundness.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the requirements.  Provide ratings that indicate the ability of the MAOs to meet and their parent organizations to assist in meeting their obligations to their enrollees.  Ratings reports must be available to CMS via the internet by September 15, 2005 and updates to the ratings must be reported to CMS immediately upon the rater becoming aware that an update is necessary.  CMS is purchasing ratings so that it can monitor whether Medicare managed care organizations continue to comply with State requirements for fiscal soundness.  Compliance with State requirements is a condition of holding a Medicare managed care contract.  All interested parties may request a solicitation package by contacting Lucille Lee via email at Lucille.Lee@cms.hhs.gov.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.

<RESPDATE>080505
<ARCHDATE>08202005
<CONTACT>Randall Pickwell, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109661325, Fax 4109659560, Email randall.pickwell@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Thomson Financial Publishing (TFP) to effectively and efficiently verify depository accounts and to detect unreported depository accounts at financial institutions. To date, TFP, located at 4709 West Golf Road, 6th Floor, Skokie, Illinois 60076, is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information. TFP serves as the Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the American Bankers Association (ABA); they are purportedly the single source for assigning and retiring routing numbers for every institution that meets the criteria established by ABA; and it is believed that every financial institution in the US must come to them to be assigned, to retire, or to change a routing number. In their capacity as Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the ABA, TFP collects, processes, and maintains a database of current information on financial institutions worldwide. 

The SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services. This research has demonstrated to the SSA that TFP is the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA. SSA’s previous market research/ public notices can be found at: http://www1.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/58960, http://www1.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/204511, http://www1.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/629327, and http://www2.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/985067 . 

SSA previously awarded a one year purchase order to TFP for a Proof of Concept (POC) for these services. During the POC phase TFP successfully demonstrated a process for verifications and reimbursement requests from a number of test offices in selected states. This involved converting to electronic media the informational exchanges that now occur in paper form each year between financial institutions and SSA during the initial application period and the re-determination process. In addition to requesting account balances and interest income revealed by the applicant/recipient, the POC also requested and verified titling and balance information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the applicant/ recipient. 

The initial (POC) phase was successfully concluded, and a second follow-on phase of the POC, featuring gathering of study data for a potential nationwide roll-out of the SSA/TFP proprietary accounts verification program, was implemented over the past year. It is SSA’s current intention to proceed to the “Fully Developed Phase” and to complete systems development to fully automate the account verification, reimbursement processes, with the ultimate goal to make the verification process totally transparent to the user so that the system automatically generates verification requests, records the response and then only generates alerts to the user for cases requiring further action. This follow-on agreement will have a period of performance of one year, with an anticipated award/ start date of 9/29/2005. Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with TFP for these follow-on services and not a request for competitive proposals. 

Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as Thomson Financial Publishing may respond in writing no later than August 5, 2005 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA's objective. Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information. Interested parties that feel they can provide these services may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to Randall.Pickwell@ssa.gov. All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT- FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VERIFICATION. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with TFP. Again, all questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

 C - Description/Specifications/Work Statement


The National Institutes of Health consist of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) whose mission is to fund and conduct biomedical research. A cluster of these ICs are primarily interested in biomedical research involving the neurosciences. These ICs share a common need for research, development and research support services in order to support their neuroscience research mission.
The objective of this contract is to help provide the additional staffing necessary to help these ICs
fulfill their mission.

The ICs that this contract is designed to support are The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the
NIH Clinical Center (CC).

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supports and conducts biomedical and behavioral research on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. NIAAA also provides leadership in the national effort to reduce the severe and often fatal consequences of these problems by: 
•	Conducting and supporting research directed at determining the causes of alcoholism, discovering how alcohol damages the organs of the body, and developing prevention and treatment strategies for application in the Nation's health care system; 
•	Supporting and conducting research across a wide range of scientific areas including genetics, neuroscience, medical consequences, medication development, prevention, and treatment through the award of grants and within the NIAAA's intramural research program; 
•	Conducting policy studies that have broad implications for alcohol problem prevention, treatment and rehabilitation activities; 
•	Conducting epidemiological studies such as national and community surveys to assess risks for and magnitude of alcohol-related problems among various population groups; 
•	Collaborating with other research institutes and Federal programs relevant to alcohol abuse and alcoholism, and providing coordination for Federal alcohol abuse and alcoholism research activities; 
•	Maintaining continuing relationships with institutions and professional associations; with international, national, state and local officials; and voluntary agencies and organizations engaged in alcohol-related work; and 
•	Disseminating research findings to health care providers, researchers, policymakers, and the public. 


National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the nation's leading supporter of biomedical research on disorders of the brain and nervous system. NINDS needs to provide research services to support research at the NMR center.

This RFP synopsis is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Air Handling System Improvements IMO23990 at Federal Building No. 2, Bannister Complex, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, 64131, Solicitation Number GS06P05GZC0011.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents prepared by an architect/engineer through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000.  The contract length shall be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Government, but shall not exceed 24 months 730 calendar days after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about September 16, 2005.  This procurement will be completed using a two-step source selection process. This contract is restricted only to those firms having an existing design, construction and/or design/build contracting office within the bi-state Kansas City region defined by the Mid-America Regional Council MARC as the Kansas counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray. Such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this announcement.   Federal Building No. 2 of the Bannister Complex, which was built in 1942, has 197,410 usable square feet of office space. It consists of a basement and two levels above ground and has approximately 1,535 employees. The fan houses and air distribution equipment were added to the building around 1960.  The HVAC system consists of air handling units in fan houses located on the roof that distribute air to a major portion of the building, plus packaged air handling units that serve spaces with special needs and/or spaces mostly in the basement that were lacking in airflow from the fan house system.  The existing overall HVAC system is not energy efficient due to the use of old, inefficient equipment and the use of smaller, low efficiency, packaged units.  The existing fan house systems are in need of repair and renovation.  The supply and return fans and motors for the fan house air handling units are inefficient and inadequate in capacity to meet the airflow and static pressure requirements of the system.  The existing configuration of supply air ducts does not provide good air distribution to the entire building since not enough air velocity is maintained to force the air to the end of the system.  The scope of work includes the following: 1. Installation of five 5 new roof-top variable air volume, direct digital control, air-handling units to replace existing units. System should be equipped with a fixed supply-air temperature.  2. Removal of all penthouse fan equipment and modification of ductwork to accommodate new roof-mounted packaged air handling equipment. 3. Sealing of all chase penetrations and openings; relocating any obstructions to airflow in the chases; installing fire dampers and access panels; installing fire-rated enclosures; and replacing control valves, steam traps, strainers and roll filter media in the fan house units. Addition of medium-pressure ductwork in existing vertical chases. 4. Replacement of all existing horizontal supply ductwork on the roof with new ductwork. 5. Provision of outside air to existing packaged units located throughout the building. 6. Relocation of existing ground level air intakes to the roof. 7. Removal of existing air handling units in basement and on first floor and connection of areas served to building distribution system.  8. Replacement of outdoor air damper and actuator.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed after regular business hours.  The request for proposals RFP solicitation will be issued on or about April 12, 2005.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS.  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch 6PCA, will no longer mail hardcopies of the solicitation and amendments.  The solicitation specifications and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR www.ccr.gov and then with FEDTeDS www.fedteds.gov.  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry www.fedbizopps.gov but the sensitive but unclassified acquisitions related information specifications will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about April 28, 2005 at the GSA Office, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri.  GSA will receive proposals on or about May 12, 2005.  Date and time will be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal will be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will use the tradeoff process method of evaluation in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating technical factors and price, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage One will be technical evaluations of proposals to establish those who are most technically qualified.  Stage Two will be receipt of pricing and scheduling. Stage One technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in descending order of importance:  1. Past performance of the firm; 2. Experience and qualifications of key personnel; 3. Management plan; and 4. Team composition, organization and prior experience as a design-build team.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the best value, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 39% total for Small Business SB, which includes 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business SDB; 5% for Woman-Owned Small Business WOSB, 3% for Hub Zone Small Business; HZSB; 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business VOSB; and 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business SDVOSB.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Mike Flanigan, Contract Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4912 or fax him at 816-926-3517.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Jean Dodd, at 816-926-1174.

<DESC>CDC, NIOSH, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory intend to issue a request for quotation (RFQ) to provide engineering services to assist in the development of a test protocol, execution of the test protocol at NIOSH's Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL), documentation of the test results, and submission of the test report and supporting documentation. 

Background and Need

Many of the electrocution deaths in the construction, mining and other industries arise when employees bring high reaching mobile equipment, such as mobile cranes, dump bed trucks, and drill rigs into contact with overhead power lines.  During a recent ten year period, approximately 20% of electrocution deaths could be attributed to contact between high reaching mobile equipment and overhead power lines.  Proximity warning systems, advertised to be able to alert operators when they approach too close to a power line, have been commercially available for 30 years.  Such systems have not found widespread acceptance in industry due perceived performance deficiencies and, in part, to a lack of regulatory requirements.  The only known comprehensive study of power line proximity warning systems was published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1982.  It documented some serious performance limitations.  Proximity warning system manufacturers claim to have substantially improved product performance since then.  In addition, recent OSHA efforts are underway to improve the 29CFR Crane and Derrick Standard.  The proposed language allows the use of proximity warning systems as a means of maintaining OSHA’s required clearance distances from power lines, provided such systems are approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.  To allow approval by a third party testing laboratory, objective data must exist from which to develop a standard for use by such laboratories.  NIOSH plans to undertake such work via this solicitation.  OSHA, the International Union of Operating Engineers AFL-CIO, and equipment manufacturers have expressed interest in such a standard.  This work will establish the basis for such a national standard and it supports proposed OSHA regulations that call for the use of overhead power line proximity warning alarms as an alternate means of preventing power line electrocution.

Scope of Work

The vendor will provide the technical oversight, expertise and labor to complete the following tasks:

1.	The selected vendor will participate, along with technical representatives of NIOSH, OSHA, manufacturers of power line proximity warning alarms, labor groups, and other interested parties, in the development of a test protocol.  The first meeting will take place approximately 30 days after the award at the PRL.  Several subsequent teleconferences and email will be used to minimize travel expenses.  The protocol should be completed within 120 days after award. 



2.	The selected vendor will interface as needed with the Government’s Project Officer and/or his representative to provide test facility design recommendations to NIOSH.  NIOSH will construct, at Government expense, an outdoor test facility at PRL that can serve as a standard overhead power line test area for current (and future) power line proximity system evaluations.  The first interface teleconference will take place within two weeks of the award and as needed thereafter.  The facility design will be finalized within 90 days after award.  

3.	The selected vendor will execute the performance tests, per the test protocol developed in Item 1, at the Government-supplied outdoor facility including directing a Government-supplied crane operator, interfacing with the proximity warning system manufacturer’s engineers, and ensuring site safety for all personnel involved.  The vendor will supply all instrumentation and equipment not specifically called out as Government supplied in Section V, below.

4.	At the conclusion of the tests, the selected vendor will submit an objective draft report to NIOSH that describes tests results for of each product tested.  In addition, the selected vendor will make recommendations for important performance and construction characteristics of proximity warning systems that should be considered in a future standards document.  The draft report graphics should be prepared to adequately describe the test setup, equipment, test results, and recommendations.  These recommendations should consider input from manufacturers, labor, industry groups, and OSHA, and NIOSH.  The vendor should expect (and budget) to make one revision to the draft report after issue.

5.	Upon approval of the draft report by NIOSH, a final report shall be provided by the vendor within 13 months of award.

MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS

1.	The vendor’s proposal must show evidence of knowledge regarding the complex electric field distribution around single and multiple power line sets, a basic understanding of power line proximity warning alarm systems, a basic understanding of safe working practices around energized power lines, and demonstrate efficient use of time and personnel.  The vendor's  proposal must state that they are available to travel as needed to PRL (suburban Pittsburgh, PA area) to fulfill the requirements of the protocol development and the proposed test program. 

2.	The vendor’s Project Officer shall be qualified to practice electrical engineering by training and experience closely related to the requirements of this project.  He/she should have demonstrated experience electrical field testing.  Other proposed personnel should be qualified by appropriate training and experience to assist the vendor’s Project Officer.  The vendor shall supply a Curriculum Vitae for each person proposed for the project as part of the proposal. 

3.	The vendor shall document experience in projects similar to this proposed effort.  Such documented experience should show evidence of participation in consensus test or standards development, field testing and evaluation, and report documentation.  Consideration shall be given to recent corporate participation and thr role (Chairman, committee member, consultant, etc.) played by the vendor's proposed Project Officer in similar consensus test or standards development programs.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY.

Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for a CORE Drill System to Stryker, 4100 E. Milham Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49001.  The CORE Drill System is necessary for the 55th Medical Group to satisfy mission requirements.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because Stryker is the manufacturer and only distributor of the CORE Drill System.  This system is the only one compatible with the existing equipment in the hospital.  The procurement of the drill system must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements.  Questions should be directed to Jennifer Hoffman in writing via email:  jennifer.hoffman@offutt.af.mil or by fax:  (402) 294-7280.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT; A MARKET SURVEY FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIALLY QUALIFIED SOURCES AND THEIR SIZE CLASSIFICATIONS (SMALL BUSINESS, LARGE BUSINESS, ETC.) PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.

The Government is seeking, for preliminary planning purposes only, qualified, experienced sources interested in performing the services identified in the attached Statement of Need (SON). This action is the result of a Commercial Activity (OMB Circular A-76), where the Government has been granted permission to commence the preliminary planning process (P3) for the flying aerospace engineering instructors identified in the SON. The SON represents a broad snap shot of the requirements that could eventually be outsourced if the P3 results yield approval for a competitive sourcing study. Therefore, the Government is requesting that interested concerns furnish the following information: 

(1)	Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address.

<SOLNBR>10110
<ARCHDATE>11152005
<CONTACT>John Inman, Contracting Officer, Phone 907-228-6231, Fax 907-228-6254, Email jinman@fs.fed.us
<DESC>I. SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The Government contemplates selecting a contractor to perform archeological services at a site on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. The primary purpose of this notice is to inquire whether any firm, institution, or individual (hereafter, “contractor”) capable of performing archeological services as described below are already listed on GSA’s Schedule 899-1 (Environmental Planning Services & Documentation). Any such contractor is invited to inform the contracting officer (Mr John Inman) of its schedule listing and other particulars in a one-page summary of its interest, willingness, and capability and a one-page summary of the contemplated principal investigator’s experience and credentials. A secondary purpose of this announcement is to inquire whether any contractor not listed on GSA’s Schedule 899-1 might be interested, willing, and capable of performing the needed services. Any such contractor is also invited to inform the contracting officer of its business size status (small, women-owned, et cetera) in a one-page capability summary of its interest, willingness, and capability and a one-page summary of the contemplated principal investigator’s experience and credentials. These one-page summaries clearly marked “Coffman Cove Archeological Site Excavation; Attn: John Inman” are due to the contracting officer by noon (Alaska time) on July 27, 2005 to fax (907)228-6254 to allow a decision to be made on the method of procurement of these services (schedule buy, non-schedule set-aside purchase, et cetera).

II. ACQUISITION BACKGROUND. The contractor will furnish all services, including labor, materials, supplies, equipment, travel, transportation, and professional services, necessary to satisfactorily complete the work. The objectives are to begin the phased data recovery for the Coffman Cove Site, 49-PET-00067. The Coffman Cove Site was previously determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The Contractor will review and incorporate prior research, develop a multi-phased data recovery plan, conduct analyses of recovered artifacts and samples, and write a report on the results of the field investigation and analyses. The Contractor will be expected to work cooperatively with the City of Coffman Cove, the Wrangell Cooperative Association (WCA, a federally-recognized tribe), the USDA Forest Service, volunteers, students, and the visiting public. 

III. LOCATION. The Coffman Cove Site (49-PET-00067) is located on northeastern Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. Prince of Wales Island is the third largest island in the United States and can be reached from Ketchikan via the Inter-Island Ferry Authority or charter aircraft. The nearest large community is Ketchikan, a city of 15,000 people, which can be accessed via Alaska Airlines or the Alaska Marine Highway from Washington State. Ketchikan is approximately 70 air miles southeast of Coffman Cove. The City of Coffman Cove has about 225 people and offers services such as a boat harbor, car rental, fuel, diesel and propane, a general store with essential groceries and limited hardware supplies, laundromat, library, lodging, post office, public restroom, public telephone, RV park and dump, school, souvenirs, and basic auto and tire repair.

IV. SITE BACKGROUND. Between 1965 and 1970 the area was leveled and house trailers were placed on the site. A sand quarry was established near the north end of the site, in which human burials were discovered in 1970 and again in 1976. The Forest Service was notified of the 1976 discovery and began to assess site damages at that time. Dr Gerald Clark visited the site in 1976 and was given a small collection of bones and artifacts. The human remains were examined by Dr Lawrence Angel of the Smithsonian Institution, who identified them as probably Tlingit. Dr Clark and an assistant excavated several test pits, which encountered human remains in an undisturbed context. Further testing in 1978 yielded three radiocarbon dates from about 1700 B.C. to A.D. 250, and a single date from ca. 2155 B.C. The site was formally determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Artifacts recovered from the site are interpreted as representing the earliest developmental stages of Northwest Coast Culture. Incised decorations on a bone item appear clearly to be carved in the Northwest Coast art style. The site contains areas with intact midden and intact older deposits without shell midden. The earliest cultural deposits contain hearths and scattered obsidian artifacts. Undisturbed deposits contain deeply stratified midden with extensive layers of shells separated by living floors, hearths, layers of sterile sand and gravel, and by buried forest soil zones. Test excavations have demonstrated cultural deposits can be up to two or more meters deep in some areas. Title to the land in which the site is located was transferred from the United States to the State of Alaska in 1986 under the provisions of the Alaska Statehood Act. After the City of Coffman Cove incorporated in 1989, it was eligible to select lands under the municipal title provisions of the same act. In 1993 the State Office of History and Archaeology conducted investigations at the site to determine future management recommendations, including recommendations for data recovery of certain portions of the site. 

V. ANTICIPATED WORK RESULTS. The following outcomes are expected from this effort: (1) pre-field research of all prior work that has taken place at the site, including an examination of all previously recovered artifacts; (2) a multi-phased data recovery plan and research design in which each phase is self-contained and is fully completed and reported before the next phase is initiated; (3) participation in consultations with the city and WCA; (4) completion of the first phase of the data recovery plan, incorporating public education and participation from students, community citizens, members of the WCA, and volunteers; and (5) a report describing the methods and results of the field excavation and analyses, with recommendations for any changes necessary to carry out the second phase of the data recovery plan.

VI. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. The Government is prepared to make the following available to the contractor: (1) copies of previous reports and papers relating to the Coffman Cove Site; (2) Prince of Wales Island road guide map; (3) access to all previously-recovered cultural artifacts and samples, as negotiated with the State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Recreation, Office of History and Archaeology; (4) access to Forest Service files containing documents pertinent to the Site and surrounding area; and (5) use of a nearby work camp location for crew living quarters during the field season. 

VII. CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES. The Contractor must ensure that work adheres to the standards set forth in the Archeology and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (48 FR 44716, 1983, as amended (Secretary’s Standards)). (1) Pre-field Research. The Contractor will be responsible for research in libraries, museums, tribal interviews, and public agency and private files to prepare a concise narrative of the prehistory of southern Southeast Alaska, with specific reference to prehistoric human use of Prince of Wales Island in relation to larger regional patterns. The purpose of the pre-field research is to provide a context for interpretation of the results of the contract and to provide a basis for developing the data recovery plan. (2) Data Recovery Plan. The Contractor will be responsible for preparation of a data recovery plan and research design that will employ a multi-phased approach, each phase designed so that it is capable of being fully completed before the next phase is begun. (3) Archeological Excavation. The Contractor will be responsible for completion of the data recovery of the Coffman Cove Site. This includes presence on-site, supervising or performing excavation, recording, data analysis, or discussions with City or tribal representatives, the media, or the public. (4) Data Recording and Analysis. The Contractor will be responsible for recording the number, type, provenience, and association of artifacts and features observed during the excavation using established professional archeological techniques, and will provide analyses of the data gathered during the excavation using established archeological and anthropological theory, method, and techniques. (5) Report. The Contractor will be responsible for the preparation of a report describing the project background, prehistoric context, today’s context, archeological methods employed, results of the field work and analyses, and any recommended changes for carrying out the second phase of the data recovery plan.

VIII. NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT (NAGPRA). Human remains have been previously discovered within the Coffman Cove Site, and can reasonably be expected to be encountered during the excavation. 

IX. PUBLIC INTEREST. The State of Alaska is expecting to complete the new ferry terminal building in time for ferry service to begin out of Coffman Cove in June 2006. The Contractor should expect numerous visitors will visit the site when the ferry is in town. The Contractor will be expected to provide information to public visitors concerning the purpose of the excavation, the area’s prehistory and history, and recent discoveries that can be appropriately shared with the public, and may be required to designate a specific staff person with responsibilities to serve as an interpreter for the public. The Contractor will be encouraged to use the excavation of the Site as an educational opportunity for students. These may be college students working on their degrees in anthropology, or even elementary students from the nearby communities on Prince of Wales Island. 

X. MAPPING. The Contractor will establish permanent datum and/or subdatums (as necessary) to be tied into the Alaska Tideland Survey reference points or another permanent reference point on-site. This reference point will serve as the main reference through all years of the project. The Contractor will also draw a topographic map to show the location of artifact distributions, specifically noted or collected surface materials, cultural features, excavation units, site disturbances, and prominent natural or man-made features within or near the site area

XI. EXCAVATIONS. Anticipated excavations include: (1) Area B-west: 30 1x1 meter units be excavated to an expected depth of 2.0 meters; (2) Area B-northeast: 60 1x1 meter units be excavated to an expected depth of 1.0 meters; (3) Area B-east: 50 1x1 meter units be excavated to an expected depth of 1.5 meters.

XII. DESIRED INFORMATION.  Again, the primary purpose of this notice is to inquire whether any firm, institution, or individual (hereafter, “contractor”) capable of performing archeological services as described below are already listed on GSA’s Schedule 899-1 (Environmental Planning Services & Documentation). Any such contractor is invited to inform the contracting officer (Mr John Inman) of its schedule listing and other particulars in a one-page summary of its interest, willingness, and capability and a one-page summary of the contemplated principal investigator’s experience and credentials. A secondary purpose of this announcement is to inquire whether any contractor not listed on GSA’s Schedule 899-1 might be interested, willing, and capable of performing the needed services. Any such contractor is also invited to inform the contracting officer of its business size status (small, women-owned, et cetera) in a one-page capability summary of its interest, willingness, and capability and a one-page summary of the contemplated principal investigator’s experience and credentials. These one-page summaries clearly marked “Coffman Cove Archeological Site Excavation; Attn: John Inman” are due to the contracting officer by noon (Alaska time) on July 27, 2005 to fax (907)228-6254 to allow a decision to be made on the method of procurement of these services (schedule buy, non-schedule set-aside purchase, et cetera).

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is seeking potential sources capable of performing Base Operating Services for Edwards AFB, CA. The services include Civil Engineering and Transportation (CE/Trans) tasks/functions at  Edwards AFB and all supported remote off-base locations.  See Attachment 1 of this synopsis for a list of some of the tasks involved in CE/Trans work.  The Government is currently performing Preliminary Planning in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.  Preliminary Planning is the process of determining if competitive sourcing is the optimal methodology for sourcing an organization’s commercial activities. The steps accomplished during Preliminary Planning result in market information and facts that lead to a defined business unit for competition and a Go/No Go decision on whether the requirement will be competitively sourced.  If Preliminary Planning results in a Go decision, an OMB Circular A-76 cost comparison will be conducted to determine the most cost-effective mode of operation. A contract will not be awarded if Government performance is determined to be  a more cost-effective mode of operation.  Firms capable of performing the described services are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience to: 95 CONS/PKB (Attn: Cindy Keim, 5 S. Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185 or e-mail cindy.keim@edwards.af.mil. Submissions should be limited to 15 pages and include evidence of similar past and present performance. Contractors must identify their business type (i.e., large, small, small and disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned small, HUBZone certified small, or service disabled veteran-owned small business). The NAICS code is 238990 Building and Property Specialty Trade Services and the size standard for small business is $12 million in annual receipts. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or to solicit offers from all responsible sources.  Responses will also assist the Government in determining the degree of commercial interest in this requirement.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice (market survey) to seek potential contractors for an anticipated Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) procurement.  This is not an RFP.  The FHWA is conducting this market survey to identify potential sources that have the technical capabilities to perform research on the “Accuracy Limitations of Road Profilers Based on a Single-Axis Accelerometer” as described in the “Research Project Statement” posted in Word format in conjunction with this notice. The research objectives for this project are as follows: (1) To thoroughly describe the principles of operation of road profiling systems that employ a single vertical accelerometer to measure test vehicle position. (2) To assess the sensitivity of single-accelerometer-based road profiling systems to errors in measured elevation profile caused by tilt and rotation of the profiling test vehicle and by frequency-dependent accelerometer response, assuming the range of highway grade, curvature, cross-slope, and roughness reasonably encountered for rural and urban pavements in the United States, as well as the range of vehicle dynamics and test speeds typically encountered in testing. (3) To compare the realizable performance of single-accelerometer-based road profiling systems to the performance requirements for profile measurement to support construction acceptance testing and other applications defined in AASHTO and ASTM test provisions. (4) To recommend guidelines regarding the use of road profiling equipment based on a single-axis accelerometer to measure pavement roughness for purposes of construction acceptance, asset management, and pavement research. Interested sources are invited to submit Capability Statements expressing interest in the project and describing organizational technical capabilities to perform the work. In addition, please identify your organization’s business size (i.e., large business or small business) under the applicable NAICS code for this project, NAICS 541330 (size standard of $4 Million). Please limit your technical capability information to no more than 10 pages. FHWA invites any interested organizations to submit Capability Statements by August 4, 2005, by email to Sarah.Tarpgaard@FHWA.DOT.GOV, or in writing to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, Attn: Ms. Sarah Tarpgaard (HAAM-20B), Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC, 20590. For questions concerning this announcement contact Ms. Tarpgaard at the email cited above or phone 202-366-5750. This Sources Sought Notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this Sources Sought Notice. See note 25 for specific information to be submitted in response to this notice, in addition to the information requested herein.

<DESC>The government is contemplating a FIXED PRICE Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite- Quantity (IDIQ) type of contract to fulfill roofing repair requirements at Langley AFB, VA. Historically, this requirement has been unrestricted based on local market conditions and estimated performance requirements. 

This type of contract will be used since exact time and quantity of repairs are not known at the time of award.  The contract will provide a minimum guarantee ($5,000) and roof repairs will be ordered on an as-needed basis up to maximum ceiling over the duration of the contract period.  Ordering of roof repairs after the requirements materialize allows flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling.

We are conducting market research to determine capability for competition under the following programs: 8(a) , Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business , and/or Hub Zone participation.  Interested 8 (a) firms must have an office located in the SBA-Mid-Atlantic Region .  All others must have an office within 100 miles of Langley AFB to meet the emergency response requirement.

This roofing requirement is considered a specialized trade requiring firms to be capable of performing at least 25% of the actual roofing work; however, performance capabilities beyond 25% will render greater consideration based on past performance criteria in the upcoming solicitation. 

Interested firms eligible by programs identified above and capable of fulfilling performance and response requirements on an as-needed basis, shall respond to this modified synopsis for consideration. Previous responses will not be considered.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 238160.  Respond to the POC below with capabilities statements that include a list of current and previous roofing contracts (within the last three (3) years), their location, magnitude, and points of contact, not later than 22 March 2005. 

All documents associated with this requirement will be posted on the FedBizOpps website www.eps.gov. 

To further assist in maintaining a list of interested offerors for this requirement, please provide your company name, a point of contact, address, phone number, along with your CAGE code, DUNS number, and business size under the above NAICS code to Ms. Betty Sharp, 1 CONS/LGCC, 757-764-7032, betty.sharp@langley.af.mil

<SUBJECT>D -- RFI - Telecommunications Modernization Plan
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-2005-R-081
<RESPDATE>080505
<ARCHDATE>08062005
<CONTACT>Kathleen Haddow, SeniorProcurement andContracting Specialist, Phone _, Fax _, Email acquisitions@saa.senate.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The United States Senate Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) seeks information about telecommunications solutions to upgrade or replace its existing telecommunications services, systems and infrastructure with new, improved technologies.  Specifically, the SAA wishes to consider merging its voice and data infrastructure and transitioning from a Time Division Multiplex (TDM) voice network managed solution to an Internet Protocol (IP) or IP-enabled solution.

 Therefore, the SAA has released this RFI to:
1.	Provide information to potential industry offerors explaining the needs and acquisition approach for the SAA’s Telecommunications Modernization Project (TMP) and
2.	Solicit comments from industry on how to best satisfy the SAA TMP.

The scope of the solution sought by this RFI includes the telecommunications switching equipment needed, the replacement of or interface to existing SAA adjunct systems, and new Operations Support System (OSS) software. Also included are the systems integration services required to install the new equipment and to conduct the transition process to move from the existing environment to the new TMP environment with minimum disruption to the end users. Operations and maintenance support after the transition and training support are included as well.

Locations involved in the TMP are the:
1.	Capitol Hill campus area comprising six major buildings and several smaller buildings or locations within buildings, 
2.	Alternate Computing Facility (ACF) outside Washington, D.C., and 
3.	Senators’ state offices, which should be able to be incorporated into the upgraded telecommunications system in the future after first completing the upgrade in the Washington, D.C. area.

The SAA seeks comments on alternative solutions for the architecture, means to implement the telecommunications upgrade, and standards to use. Suggested alternative solutions must ensure that:
1.	Quality of Service (QoS) is at least the same or better than the existing services,
2.	No single point of failure exists,
3.	Automatic recovery and self-healing processes for failures are in place,
4.	Centrex functions (currently provided by a DMS-100) and features (including E911) are supported,
5.	On-net to on-net calls are not blocked,
6.	Objective real time measurements of voice quality are available,
7.	Availability values are commensurate with industry best practices,
8.	There is the ability to scale the deployed system to accommodate at least 12,000 lines, and
9.	COTS products (hardware and software), which have been in active service for at least one year in a large customer or carrier environment, are used in the deployed system.

The modernized telecommunications system must support, at least, the following adjunct services and functions:
1.	Broadcast fax,
2.	Voice teleconferencing,
3.	Voice mail,
4.	Voice mail to digital file conversion,
5.	Web conferencing,
6.	Video teleconferencing,
7.	Capitol Exchange call center,
8.	Broadcast telephone messages for notifications of voting and other legislative actions, 
9.	Direct connections to the Capitol Exchange for call assistance by Senators, 
10.	Immediate connections to the US Capitol Police for emergencies with minimal (911) or no dialing required, and
11.	Interconnection with a Dialogic Communications Corporation notification system.

The SAA seeks comments and recommendations for a single comprehensive Operations Support System for voice, wireless, and data services. Suggestions on how to modernize the Senate’s telecommunications services may include upgrades to or replacement of elements of the SAA’s OSSs. 

Specifically such a system must interface with the wireline voice system to provide the following functions:
1.	Placement and tracking of wireline moves, adds, changes, and disconnect orders, 
2.	Processing of CDRs and SMDRs for generating bills, 
3.	Asset and configuration management, 
4.	Intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems,
5.	Network management systems of the voice system,
6.	Trouble reporting and tracking,
7.	Directory services,
8.	QoS measurements for any IP-based voice traffic, and
9.	Provision of backup and recovery capabilities for critical OSS files.

The acquisition approach includes consideration of the two issues described below.

1.	Ownership versus Managed Services: In general, the Senate prefers to own the equipment it uses to provide services. The Senate is interested in learning industry’s opinions as to the pros and cons of ownership versus managed service.
2.	Warranty and Long Term Maintenance Support Agreements: In regard to warranty and long term maintenance agreements, the SAA wishes to understand:
a.	The duration and scope of the warranty for equipment and services provided which might be offered under a contract,
b.	What additional support may be acquired after the warranty period ends, 
c.	The costs for additional support after the warranty period, and
d.	The term of availability for the additional support.

The SAA will consider the ease of transition, scalability, expandability, availability, maintainability, QoS, and security, when evaluating recommended alternative solutions. Respondents should comment on these topics and may suggest others for consideration.

Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible in addressing issues discussed in this RFI. Feedback of a general or non-specific nature is less useful and will have limited utility in refining the acquisition strategy and impacting the content of an RFP.  The SAA invites comments on all aspects of the SAA TMP acquisition. Respondents should: 
1.	Identify security vulnerabilities associated with their proposed solution and describe how to mitigate or eliminate these vulnerabilities,
2.	Propose and describe the architecture to accommodate the solution including:
a.	Discussion of the infrastructure required,
b.	How a single point of failure would be eliminated, 
c.	Automatic recovery and self-healing processes for failures,
d.	How on-net to on-net call blocking would be avoided,
e.	The maximum number of busy hour call completions which could be accommodated, and
f.	How scalability would be accommodated and the level to which the solution could be scaled.
3.	Suggest appropriate COTS products and/or services for implementing the alternative solution, 
4.	Comment on what SLAs, if any, should be incorporated into a contract,
5.	Indicate which adjunct systems should be integrated into the recommended alternative solution and which systems should be standalone and only interface with the solution, 
6.	Comment on the OSS platform, 
7.	Recommend a VoIP network management system and describe its capabilities, 
8.	Comment on what percent availability the recommended solution would have, the means to achieve this availability, and the respondent’s definition of availability,
9.	Comment on how to achieve voice quality of service,
10.	Describe how E911 calling would be implemented,
11.	List the standards to which the proposed solution would adhere, and
12.	Comment, in general terms on the adequacy and reasonableness of the capabilities and functions identified in this RFI.

The SAA invites all sources of information to respond to this request.  Responses to this request are due no later than August 5, 2005 at 12:00 Noon EDT and shall be submitted electronically via email only to acquisitions@saa.senate.gov.  Response shall not exceed 40 pages.  The subject line of the email message must be RFI 2005-R-081 Telecommunications Modernization Plan.  Access to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party.  The SAA is not responsible for any failure to access information.  The information supplied in response to this request will not be used to pre-qualify vendors or suppliers for purposes of soliciting proposals.  Neither the Senate nor the SAA will be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this request.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SAA OR U.S. SENATE.  ANY TELEPHONE OR E-MAIL REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for continued research and development efforts for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source  under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their  interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all  proposals received within the dates and time indicated will be considered by  the Government.  It is the Government's intent to negotiate a contract with  MountainTop Technologies, Inc. (MTT), 647 Main Street, Ste. 310, Johnstown, PA  15901, for their Integrated Emergency Operations Center (IEOC) Program, to  provide all necessary labor and materials to develop, coordinate and execute a  program focused on supporting a prototype EOC facility designed and installed  during Year 1 of the effort, and to include additional efforts of developing  validated user requirements against all tiers in the National Response  Plan/NIMs Operations Notional Structure. Additional FY06 efforts include  establishing a case/scenario database of attacks/events in all sectors of  Homeland Defense, develop layered objective architecture for surveillance and  warning, establishing sentinel events (triggers) in each sector of Homeland  Defense, establish response methods for event combinations, and develop/draft  data dictionaries and search methodologies relevant to the role of the IEOC.   This effort is a follow-on to the Penn State University task under contract  W15QKN-04-D-1012.  The rationale for sole source to MTT is that the cost to  replicate capabilities is estimated to be in excess of $5M and a program  slippage of approximately eighteen (18) months.  MTT also has a working  relationship with the community for delivery and validating user requirements  for adequate data package to enable competition at this time.  Note 22 and 26  apply.

<DESC>Date Issued:  20 July 2005 Closing Date and Time: 5 August 2005 1630 Hours (Local Time)  81MM  Illuminating Mortar Candle Production The Office of the Product Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems is conducting a market survey to identify additional  potential sources capable of production  of  fielded and/or developed  candle assemblies for 81mm Illuminating Mortar Cartridges (see cartridge descriptions and candle performance parameters below). Potential candidates must have the production capability to produce a combination of 10,000 candles for the M816 Infra-red (IR) and M853A1 Visible Light (VL) per month with a total annual production of 100,000. The Government  is interested only in those potential offerors who have specific knowledge in this subject matter and have experience and the ability, to become a qualified producer by  July  2006. A qualification contract is anticipated to be awarded in January 2006 based on favorable evaluation of the white papers. Potential offerors shall submit a white paper, not to exceed ten pages describing current/planned production facilities and processes.  A detailed process map identifying critical processes is required.  Potential offeror must also describe a schedule of  how the design supports a qualification program to test this design by July  2006.  A TDP for the 81mm Cartridge canister is available. A canister is defined as a metal candle case containing the candle mix. The 81mm Cartridge Descriptions and Candle Assembly Performance Parameters: The M816 and M853A1 are fin stabilized Illuminating Mortar Cartridges which have a body assembly, consisting of a thin aluminum wall body tube and an aluminum tail cone. The body shall contain the candle mix in a metal candle case with a swivel assembly.  The parachute is also contained in the body and is connected to the swivel assembly of the candle case which contains the illuminant mix. The weight of both M816 and M853A1 candle assemblies shall be approximately 2.5 pounds each. The M853A1 candle shall produce a minimum visible light of 525,000 candelas and shall burn for a minimum of 50 seconds in the air.

<SUBJECT>--Planned Extension of the Non-Stockpile Systems Contracts II Ordering Period
<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to conduct a market survey of parties that may have interest and capability to respond to and comply with Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel program requirements or submit proposals if a future competitive Non-Stock pile Systems Contract (NSSC) request for proposal  is issued.   The anticipated award lead-time for this would be approximately one year.  If issued, a future competitive NSSC acquisition would be based on a best value, multiple award approach with submission of initial and probably final written proposals and oral pre sentations.  Qualifications necessary to be considered a viable candidate to compete in a future NSSC will include, among other technical and management qualifications, relevant Chemical Demilitarization experience and past performance, with emphasis withi n the Non-Stockpile Chemical Material program.  In addition, interested parties are notified that the standard procedure, unless exempted, for issuing task orders over $100,000 is to compete them among the awarded contractors.  Substantial proposal prepara tion efforts and cost would be involved for both competition of the basic contract as well as any competed task orders.  As such, given the projected limited workload beyond 2006 and the competitive aspects of task ordering, a contractor, even if awarded a  basic NSSC contract, may not be able to recoup all of its proposal preparation costs based on the competitive task source selection decisions.  The only guaranteed workload is the stated minimum contract quantity of $100,000 contained in the basic contrac t.  The current projected workload for 2007 through 2012 includes 2 task orders being planned for award in 2007, 2 in 2008, and 1 in 2009.  These task orders vary in scope and period of performance.  Other tasks not planned may occur and would be handled o n a task by task basis.   Based on a competitive, formal best value solicitation, four basic systems contracts, under the Non-Stockpile Systems Contract (NSSC) II acquisition, were awarded, on 7 Dec 2001, as indefinite quantity, task order types (FAR 16.504).  The NSSCII basic cont racts contained an umbrella statement of work (SOW) that established the overall requirements and capabilities for acquiring the systems support for the Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel program.  Each NSSCII contract had a minimum contract quantity of $100, 000 and a maximum contract quantity of $300,000,000.   The basic contracts contain both competitive and non-competitive ordering procedures (FAR 16.505) for awarding the various task orders during the ordering period and allow for the award of six different contract types. The standard procedure, unless exempt ed, for ordering task orders over $100,000 is to compete them among the four awarded contractors. To accomplish the systems support, a 60 month ordering period with a 96 month overall period of performance was established in the four basic NSSCII contracts .  To date, sixteen task orders have been awarded under the NSSCII basic contracts for an approximate value of $140 million.  The contract type for each awarded task was based on the requirements and risks associated with the individual task order.  Many o f the tasks involved complex requirements, extensive integration and coordination efforts, and significant environmental and safety matters.  Indemnification has been approved on some of the NSSCII basic contracts. As ordered by task order, the NSSCII requirements have included program/task management and integration, equipment design, design upgrade or modification, fabrication, engineering, system development and integration, testing, system/equipment operations, a gent operations, hazardous waste disposal, and former production facility decontamination and disposal.  The performance of these efforts was accomplished at various locations, including government installations, as specified in the individual task order(s ). The current ordering period under the  NSSCII basic contracts will expire as of 7 Dec 2006.  Based on a review of the anticipated significant proposal preparation/evaluation costs for a follow-on future competition and on the limited projected workload beyond 2006, the government is planning, in accordance with DFARS 217.204(e)(i), to process an extension to the NSSCII ordering period from 7 Dec 2006 to 7 Dec 2011 in lieu of issuing a new, competitive follow-on acquisition.   The overall period of performance under the NSSCII basic contracts wo uld be extended from 7 Dec 2009 to 7 Dec 2012.  However, the maximum contract quantity and umbrella SOW of the existing NSSCII basic contracts will not be changed. It is the governments intent to limit the extension to the four current NSSCII basic contractors under the authorities of DFARS 217.204(e)(i) and of FAR 6.302-1 based on a substantial duplication of cost to the government and to the competing contractors that is not expected to be recovered through a future competition.  Please submit your interest in response to this special notice, and a description of your capabilities, as it applies to Non-Stockpile requirements, to the noted point of contact, Mrs. Jessica Dobbeleare.  Responses are requested no later than 19 August 20 05.  Email submission is acceptable. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received within thirty days after the date of publication of this special notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compe te with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the planning purpose of determining whether to conduct a follow-on NSSCII competitive a cquisition.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement is a sole source notice constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Requirement for FM Digital Demultiplexing Systems from Ulyssix Technologies Inc., Middleton, MD.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: After reviewing other vendors product Ulyssix was the only vendor that had a standard system that met the specifications of our existing telemetry processing requirements for the NASA New Horizons Pluto-Charon mission. This demultiplexing system is critical to our launch operations.  This mission requires a launch vehicle configuration that has never been used before.  A Delta 3rd Stage booster will be mated on top of an Atlas 5 1st stage.	This unusual configuration requires NASA KSC to process telemetry data that only the demultiplexing system can provide.	The three FM Digital Demultiplexing Systems will be deployed to remote sites to process the Delta 3rd stage data as it is transmitted during the launch phase of the mission.   This determination was made after an extensive canvassing of various technology industry personnel for alternative suppliers and yielded no other competitive suppliers of the referenced product.  It is in the best interest of NASA to sole source this procurement to Ulyssix who has the only standard product that meets all requirements.  The provisions and clauses in this solicitation are those in effect through FAC 2005-05. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code (334515) and the small business size standard for this procurement is 500 employees.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer of mission suitability, which shall be considered by the agency.  However, based on the information above, the government does not anticipate any offers other than Ulyssix's that can meet the requirements. Delivery to KSC.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by COB, 12:00PM. EST on July 25, 2005 to OP-LS, KSC, FL 32899, solicitation number PR4200116486, FOB destination to KSC, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>This synopsis for commercial supplies and services is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and Simplified Acquisition Procedures in Part 13. This notice constitutes the only solicitation; a Request for Quotation is being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is set aside 100% for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The NAICS code is 541420 and the size standard is $6 M. The requirement is for the following: A Learning Xchange Furniture Layout and Audio/Visual System Design. BACKGROUND: The Cincinnati and Dayton Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC), located at 3200 Vine Street, Cincinnati Ohio, 45220 and 4100 W. Third Street, Dayton, Ohio 45428, are developing new space identified as Learning Xchange Centers. The Cincinnati Learning Xchange Center will be in Building 1, the Dayton Center will be in Building 307. These spaces use educational/productivity methodologies to improve training and planning within VA. There is a necessary requirement to have a distinctive design and layout in each Center, which will provide heightened accessibility, adaptability, and will promote the highest range of usage. New concepts in audio/visual technology facilitate these unique learning and training experiences, as this system will extend the experience to other sites in our region and possibly across the country. STATEMENT OF WORK: The Contractor will provide all labor and materials necessary to perform technology design and furniture layout at each VAMC. This work shall include developing any and all full construction drawing sets and specifications to facilitate installation of furniture and technology. The furniture is government furnished property developed by MG Taylor Corporation. The furniture layout will be developed around this government furnished furniture already purchased to maximize the potential of the Learning Xchange environment.

 The USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) Portsmouth has a requirement to purchase: Beacon Signal Generator

  1200-SMSK-PIVIAFE Digital Global Position System (DGPS) Beacon Signal Generator

The 1200~SMSK-PMAFE is the signal generation module of the MR-1O1 enhanced DGPS medium frequency data modulator. This module accepts signals from a DSP card PMAFE interface and generates a Shaped MSK modulated data at user selectable data rates and carrier frequency. The 1200-SMSK-PMAFE timing is based on either an internal or an external 10 MHz frequency reference that may be both time and frequency synchronized to an external One-PPS pulse from GPS. The l200-SMSK-PMAFE is designed to operate with a companion DSP card, for example, the Momentum Data Systems HAWK89 board, hosted on a PC PCI bus. This combination permits control of the modulation process and the generation of the desired data message.

To permit immediate testing of the 1200-SMSK-PMAFE, the cards are shipped with SMSK modulator test software. This Windows® based program generates a phase modulated carrier using standard RTCM SC 104 formatted 6-of-8 formatted messages or fixed internally generated test messages. 

1200-SMSK-PMAFE specifications when interfaced with the HA WK89 DSP card (MRD-101) and CEI control software

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-8514), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>It is the intent of the U. S. Army Communications Electronics-Life Cycle Management Command to award a 12 month labor hour contract for development of a new system to provide access to a variety of subsistence related data that can provide critical p lanning and status information for use by all levels in the Army Food Program. Develop an Army Subsistence Business Intelligence System (ASBIS) integrating Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products with INTERNET technology and ancillary WEB-based applicatio ns to effectively and efficiently manage the worldwide Army subsistence mission using secure, WEB-based technology linked to the Army's Knowledge Management (AKO) portal. Tasks outlined below include all those tasks necessary for the successful development  (Analysis, Design, Coding, Configuration Management, System Administration, Testing, Documenting, and Deployment) of the Army Subsistence Business Intelligence System (ASBIS). Because ASBIS will leverage the functional data that exists in the Army Food Manangment Information System (AFMIS)databas e, knowledge and expertise of the existing AFMIS system is required. Additionally, it requires expertise in the business of Army Food Management as well as the data warehousing and web presentation protocols. It also requires the application of sound manag ement practices and periodic reporting to the Government on project status. ASBIS development is directed to commence concurrently with the final stages of AFMIS WEB Beta during 4th Quarter FY05 and conclude in the 4th quater of FY06. Based on the complexity and magnitude of the system performance capabilities to be analyzed, the Government requires the technical analysis effort to be completed NLT 1st Quarter FY06 in order that hardware and software procurements and implementation schedules can be planned and coordinated with worldwide customers. T he end product of the technical analysis is (1) a recommendation for system architecture and software changes and (2) a proposed schedule/plan for incremental system delivery that supports an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) demonstration NLT 1 May 200 6 as well as a Full Operational Capability (FOC) demonstration NLT 4th quarter FY06. The Contractor shall implement the following components of the Army Food Business Intelligence System (ASBIS): a) ASBIS should be built using proven data warehouse data engineering and design principles to automatically update the data warehouse and transform the transaction level data as needed. b) Development of login application for the ASBIS that leverages Army AKO login and password. c) Automatic collection and storage of data from Army Food Management databases to track food consumption statistics and metrics. Specific measurements will include those already in place with the existing legacy Army Food Management Information System. Additionally, ASBIS should provide the following informational components to all organizational levels as appropriate through a web front end: 1) Detailed meal sales data 2) Catered meal data 3) Transaction data 4) Dashboard designs for easy identification of out of tolerance 5) Financial Reimbursement data 6) Field Unit level feeding statistics 7) Headcount statistics 8) Item level data 9) Exception-based reporting 10) Equipment Replacement forecasting models 11) Food Management Contractor Support Data 12) Archive reporting against historical data from existing DSS d. The Contractor shall develop key 'dashboard' system metrics and work with the Government designated representative to promulgate the system level metrics via email to the appropriate senior managers. e. The Contractor shall participate in periodic in-process reviews to present status. The Government will approve incremental deliveries prior to continuation to the next milestone.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commerical services. This is a Requset for Quote for the United States Department of Commerce for ageing deep-water corals from the Davidson Seamount.

Background: 
Building off the successes of an expedition to characterize the Davidson Seamount, this project will focus on ageing deep-water corals.  The expedition in 2002 was the initial effort to characterize the biology and geology of the Davidson Seamount, 1,250 – 3,700 meters deep off Central California (see http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02davidson/davidson.html and http://www.mbnms-simon.org/sections/seamounts/project_info.php?pid=100114&sec=s).  In addition to the description of biota with depth, there was a more focused assessment on the distribution of corals, and some initial ageing of Paragoria, Keratoisis, and Corallium species.  This work was published in 2005 by Springer-Verlag in “Cold-water Corals and Ecosystems,” edited by Freiwald and Roberts.  The apparent great age (over 200years) of Keratiosis specimens (bamboo corals) has implications for resource managers and educators in the National Marine Sanctuary Program.  The Davidson Seamount is currently under consideration for being included within the borders of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS), partly because of the age and fragile nature of its corals.  The MBNMS requires a detailed investigation of bamboo coral age and growth of specimens collected from the Davidson Seamount.


Contract Services:
Assess age, growth, and morphometrics for bamboo corals (Keratoisis sp.)
•	Samples must be from Davidson Seamount, located 120 kilometers to the southwest of Monterey, due west of San Simeon (35° 43’ 23”N, 122° 43’ 23”W).
•	Analyses should be from at least two colonies from different locations on the seamount.
•	Both linear and radial growth must be investigated.
•	Radiometric techniques (i.e., Lead-210 dating) are the preferred method for this ageing project.
•	Morphometric measurements should be made to compare colonies and assess patterns of growth.
•	A final report will provide age estimates, physical descriptions of the coral colonies, detailed methods, interpretation relative to the scientific literature, and images of the corals and methods used to determine age.

    (1)
      (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name,
          "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is

        assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment
        of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
        the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's
        CCR record that indicates payments, including those made
        by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that
        Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information
        within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
        paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
