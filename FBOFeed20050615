<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading the national effort to revise the 1996 Guidelines for the Death Scene Investigation of Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death and the Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death Investigation Report Form (SUIDIRF).  The SUIDIRF is used nationally by states, counties, and local jurisdictions on a voluntary basis to gather information about the circumstances surrounding sudden, unexplained infant deaths (SUIDS).  The SUIDIRF is important because it provides a standardized system for the death scene investigation of SUIDS.  Lack of such a standardization results in inaccurate diagnosis and reporting of the cause of death, and thus hinders our ability to monitor trends in SUIDS, conduct meaningful research, and monitor programs aimed at preventing SUIDS.  To improve the diagnosis and reporting of SUIDS in the US, all death scene investigators need to have access to and familiarity with the form, as well as training on how to conduct a SUIDS death scene investigation.  Therefore, the CDC, Maternal and Infant Health Branch (MIHB) is seeking to obtain the services from an experienced contractor to train coroners, medical examiners and all those involved with infant death scene investigations to conduct an infant death scene investigation using the revised SUIDIRF and related training materials.
There is a base period of performance approximately 8 months and two option periods of 12 months each. CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to BBiltz@cdc.gov. The tentative issue date is March 16, 2005, with the RFP issue date approximately 30 days after posting of the RFP. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. The associated NAICS codes are 541710 or and the small business size standard is $6 million. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.  See numbered note 1.

Only offers that include pricing for all items within a LOT will be considered for award.  However, firms are not required to quote on all LOTS to be considered for an award.  Firms are cautioned that the Government, while reserving the right to do so, may proceed to award without entering discussions or requesting further information from any firm.  Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer for each lot - which may result in orders with multiple firms.  Additionally, CSOSA may negotiate adjustments to quantities or product selections after placing order(s) should technical requirements be revised to meet agency needs.  Questions about this requirement must be in writing and submitted by e-mail or fax. Telephone inquiries are strongly discouraged.

<DESC>The Low Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) program is soliciting proposals due 2 August 2005 (initial selection).  Point of Contact (POC): Dr. Greg Duckworth, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714; facsimile: 703-524-2449; e-mail: BAA05-39@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred).  OBJECTIVE:  In support of the LAASS Program, DARPA/SPO is soliciting proposals (both technical and cost) from qualified corporations, research institutions, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Department of Energy (DoE) laboratories under BAA05-39.  The goal of LAASS is the development of Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) and Manned Aircraft (MAC)-based sensor systems that will detect, locate, and characterize power distribution infrastructure and underground or otherwise hidden facilities and operations in rural or urban environments. These include underground facilities (UGFs), tunnels, buildings/basements, caves, and activities under heavy foliage.  The desired sensor payloads include acoustic, electromagnetic (EM-magnetometers and electric field) sensors for passive field sensing, and gravity gradiometers.  Three sensor/platform configurations are of interest: 1) a small UAV with EM and Acoustic capability, 2) an EM sensor payload capability for use on existing manned helicopters, and 3) a Gravity Gradiometry sensor, processing, and platform integration design concept for either manned or unmanned rotary wing aircraft.  A baseline concept for LAASS was developed by a Government Team in Phase 1.  Based on this concept, a 12 month Phase 2 Advanced Algorithm Development and System Design activity will be funded under this BAA. It should focus on sensor packaging for platform noise reduction, and development and demonstration advanced algorithms for sensor SNR enhancement and achievement of end-to-end system detection, localization, and target imaging goals.  Their performance should be demonstrated using Government furnished data as input.  The result of this phase will be Concept Design(s) and the estimated performance for Phase 3 form-fit prototype(s), and an updated execution plan and cost for the Phase 3 prototype final design, development, and demonstration effort. A 27 month Phase 3 Advanced System Prototype Development and Demonstration activity will be funded under this BAA for the performer(s) whose Concept Design(s) are selected from Phase 2.  In this phase winning performer(s) will conduct final design, build, and demonstration of the platform-integrated form-fit systems for the sensor/platform configuration(s) they have designed. A classified Proposers Day Briefing will be held on 15-16 June 2005 to summarize the technical results achieved to-date and to present the goals and structure of the LAASS program to potential proposers.  An unclassified data package will be released to potential proposers, and a 3-4 hour detailed tutorial on its use will be provided.  It is appropriate to bring technical analysis staff with MATLAB-equipped laptops to the tutorial to obtain the maximum benefit, though phone-based database support will be provided during the proposal and execution phase.  One-on-one meetings with the DARPA Program Manager and other members of the LAASS Government Team will be available as well.  It is expected that all material will be presented on 15 June, but that additional one-on-one meetings and repeat presentations of results details and database tutorials will be available on 16 June.  Overall programmatic material will not be re-briefed on 16 June. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Proposers must obtain the BAA05-39 Proposers Information Packet (PIP) which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including the technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and format of proposals.  Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award.  The PIP is not classified and may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website. A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP.  These include a classified Proposers Day to be held 15-16 June 2005 at Booz Allen Hamilton, 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia 22203.  See announcement SN05-27 or contact SN05-27@darpa.mil to attend the Proposers Day.  Attendance is not mandatory to bid on this BAA.  The PIP and Unclassified material from the Proposer’s Day brief will be available on the LAASS Website, http://www.darpa.mil/spo/solicit/laass/index.htm.   Proposers with proper personnel and facility security clearances must obtain the classified Addendum to the PIP that details the system performance expected by DARPA. To receive the classified addendum to the PIP, and classified material presented at the Proposers Day, interested parties must provide a classified mailing address, point of contact (POC), and CAGE code to BAA05-39@darpa.mil.  If the proposer wishes to receive the document via SIPRNET, provide the POCs valid SIPRNET address in addition to the mailing address, POC, and CAGE code.  All key personnel who will be working on this program are required to have a final SECRET clearance or higher. In order to obtain a SECRET clearance, individuals must be a U.S. citizen.  Unclassified contractors including foreign companies can perform as subcontractors to provide critical technologies. Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be e-mailed directly to BAA05-39@darpa.mil.  It is anticipated that contracts will be awarded on or about 1 October  2005.  The Government will not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  Proposals must be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Proposers should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published on the FedBizOpps website.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  Each cost proposal shall contain a  section satisfying the following requirements:  awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR, subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All Proposers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.

This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Proposer has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  If the Proposer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in the section.

By submission of its proposal, each Proposer agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM), Madison, WI, for services to produce a coastal community handbook version of the No Adverse Impact (NAI) Toolkit in English and Spanish.  The Coastal Services Center, in partnership with ASFPM has an initiative to assist local communities in management development, with the understanding that minimum national approaches will not decrease future flood damage or provide long term protection to the natural and beneficial functions in floodplains.  ASFPM has developed and trademarked the NAI initiative to help shape floodplain policy and reduce flood losses.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Procurement by less than full and open competition is necessary because of the unique capability of the Association of State Floodplain Managers and its breadth of technical expertise and program management experience with coastal hazards.  The period of performance shall be from August 1, 2005 through January 31, 2007.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by June 30, 2005.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  The applicable NAICS is 541990.

<DESC>A-The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS, intends to negoticate with Brigham Young University, Center for Remote Sensing, Provo, UT. on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 ( c) (1), only one responsible source. The Center for Remote Sensing at Bringham Young University has developed the ultra high spatial resolution (5km) QuilSCAT wind retrieval technique. They have written all the processing research software to produce the ultra high resolution winds from the raw QuikSCAT data, and are the only source that can implement the required modifications in the operational QuikSCAT processing at NOAA. Experimental products for ultra high resolution ocean sigma-O images and ultra high resolution wind retrieval have been developed at BYU. A limited set ultra high resolution wind products was experimentally produced and distributed as part of a  operational demonstration this past hurricane season. This effort seeks to expand upon that effort by improving and validating the 5km wind product, and integrating it into the QuikSCAT operational processing system. Tasks are: 1. prepare and port 5-km retrieval code to operations with new land-mask to allow for retrievals closer to the coast; 2. Test and validate retrieval results; 3. Implement for TC-specific events; 4. Work with NESDIS to implement in and operational demonstration mode for testing and evaluation.

The following paragraphs are added to 52.212-1: (m) Offerors are REQUIRED to submit Past and Present Performance Information with their proposal. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable. The second sentence of Paragraph (a) is amended as follows: "The factors identified below, past performance and price being ranked coequally, will be considered during proposal evaluation. A SINGLE AWARD SHALL BE MADE ON AN "ALL OR NONE" BASIS TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE OFFEROR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ENSUING CRITERIA. EACH OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL SHALL BE PREPARED AS OUTLINED BELOW. A) PART 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE. The evaluation of Part 1 data will result in a rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory. Factor: Past performance or experience in the refuse collection and disposal industry. B) PART 2 - PRICE. The evaluation of Part 2 will result in ranking the quotation by lowest aggregate price. Factor: Price. Offerors must prepare proposals in sufficient detail to permit a thorough evaluation of each part. Each part must be clearly marked "Part 1 – Past Performance" and "Part 2 - Price". The offerors will be evaluated using the Performance - Price Trade-Off procedures in accordance with Attachment No. 3, entitled "Evaluation of Offerors". (I) FACTOR 1: PAST PERFORMANCE. Offerors shall provide information on present and past performance that summarizes present and prior Government (federal, state and local) and commercial contracts they consider relevant to this effort and the evaluation criteria to demonstrate their ability to perform the proposed effort. Offerors are advised that the Government will use all available data. All such data used, including data related to offeror's performance as a subcontractor and to the performance of the offeror's proposed subcontractor(s) will be reflected in the evaluation of the prime contractor. Complete the PAST AND PRESENT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE See Attachment No. 4. Past Performance describes how well the contractor performed the work. Offerors are restricted to documenting three of the most recent and relevant contracts. Offerors shall submit the past and present performance information on contracts they consider relevant in demonstrating their ability to perform the proposed effort. This information may include data on efforts performed by other divisions, corporate management, critical subcontractors, or teamed subcontractors, if such resources will be brought to bear or significantly influence the performance of the proposed effort. For all current or past contracts deemed relevant, the offeror shall provide the following type of information: (a) Company/Division name, (b) Program Title, (c) Contracting Agency, (d) Contract Number, (e) Brief description of the contract effort, (f) Type of contract, (g) Period of performance (h) Original contract $ value and current $ value, (I) Original completion date and current completion date (j) Name, telephone number and address of the Commercial and Government Director/Program Manager, and for Government contracts, the Contracting Officer. Offerors shall explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort. Explain the relevancy of the past contracts in terms of the effort required by the Statement of Work. Offerors are permitted, but not required, to submit information on significant achievements or to explain past problems they consider relevant to the proposed effort, as well as past efforts to identify and manage risk and corrective actions taken. If offerors have no relevant past performance, the proposal must so state. (ALERT: Offerors are strongly encouraged to use the PAST AND PRESENT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE). If you choose not to use the PAST AND PRESENT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE, you are cautioned to complete and provide with your proposal all the data requested in the Questionnaire. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "none", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. (II) FACTOR 2: PRICE. Price will be evaluated for fairness, and reasonableness as it relates to the service offered. (1) Fairness and reasonableness - the degree to which the proposed price compares to the price a reasonable and prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar goods or services. Award will be made based on the best value to the Government. Past Performance and Price are of equal value.   FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, is applicable. The following sentences are added to the existing paragraph (a) in FAR 52.212-4: "If any of the services do not conform with contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may (i) require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements and (ii) reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may (i) by contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service or (ii) terminate the contract for cause."

<DESC>The Program Support Center on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate and award a contract to the National Association of Protection & Advocacy Systems (NAPAS) on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) administers programs under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights (DD) Act of 2000. 

The purpose of this contract would be to continue technical assistance to the 57 State Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Agencies whose mission is to protect the human and civil rights and interests of individuals with disabilities, including developmental disabilities and mental illness.    The goal of this assistance is to improve program performance (increase self-advocacy and build capacity), statutory compliance and program outcomes across the state P&A systems.  This contract will enable technical assistance to the P&A Agencies that protect the interests of individuals with cognitive, mental and physical disabilities.  

This technical assistance covers a wide array of training, consultation, information dissemination, best practices and capacity building, and legal and advocacy-based training. 

NAPAS is the 57 P&As’ national membership organization.  NAPAS serves as a clearinghouse and a core from which emanates ideas, issues, potential challenges and solutions and information exchange.  NAPAS provides cohesiveness  across the 57 P&As in thwarting challenges to the human and civil rights of individuals  with disabilities, including developmental disabilities and mental illness.  The 57 P&As view NAPAS as a trusted source and resource for cutting edge, state of the art approaches to legal and advocacy activities.  NAPAS has a unique insight into the needs of the P&As across the country.  The training and technical assistance for the P&As requires an entity with the in depth knowledge and understanding of the operations and needs of the P&As.  Since NAPAS is the P&As’ membership organization, NAPAS has the unique insight and experience to provide the training and technical assistance as well as the legal advocacy to the P&As.    The 57 P&As view NAPAS as their hub for legal and advocacy services.  NAPAS is uniquely qualified to provide training and technical assistance across the P&A system because the 57 P&As have invested time, money and effort to develop a membership organization they can trust and depend on to provide them support they need to achieve their mission:  protect the human and civil rights of individuals with disabilities, including mental illness.  There is no other entity with the innate and unique ability to provide appropriate training and technical assistance to the 57 P&A systems across the United States.

The period of performance for the contract shall be a base year plus four option years.  

Any contractors that may have the requisite qualifications to perform the work describe above, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following:  (1) demonstrated experience in providing legal and advocacy-based training to the Protection and Advocacy Systems; (2) demonstrated experience of organizational structure and management of Protection and Advocacy Systems; (3)  demonstrated experience in conducting workshops and conferences; (4) demonstrated experience with Protection and Advocacy Systems measurement of outcomes and reporting processes; (5) ability to provide staff that has proven successful academic and professional work experiences in the field of developmental, emotional and other significant disabilities; proven ability to direct and mange projects of this magnitude including accounting/bookkeeping; proven experience in providing and coordinating training and technical assistance activities; and proven experience in managing contracts or programs for training and technical assistance as a project director.

No solicitation document is available.     Capability statements must be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.    If no capability statements are received which specifically demonstrate the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with a sole source contract to NAPAS.

<DESC>The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the Food and Drug Administration has a requirement to gain access to data resources that can be used to (1) conduct drug safety analyses to the benefit of the public’s health; (2) respond expeditiously to urgent public safety concerns; (3) provide a mechanism for collaborative pharmacoepidemiological research designed to test hypotheses, particularly those arising from suspected adverse reactions reported to FDA and enable rapid access to U.S. population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary. 

The Contractor shall provide US health encounter data for pharmacoepidemiology studies through collaboration with FDA; availability of a computerized system for linking each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, drug exposure data, coded medical outcomes, vital records (desired, but not required), cancer registries (desired, but not required), and birth defect registries (desired, but not required); capability of providing a patient population with low turnover, thereby permitting long-term longitudinal follow-up of most patients for acute or delayed adverse effects from drugs or other medical products; ability to capture all outpatient prescription drug exposures and health provider encounters, linked longitudinally to each patient; ability to capture all health provider encounters whether in the ambulatory, emergency, chronic care, or acute care setting in sufficient detail so that FDA has the ability to estimate the contribution of various risk factors (e.g., age, gender, dose, co-existing disease, disease severity, concomitant medications) associated with the occurrence of medical events of interest; demonstrated (post HIPAA) ability to access and retrieve complete, primary medical records as required for completion and validation of studies; ability to provide exposure data on new molecular entities (those approved within the last 5 years in the United States) and identify adverse drug events that occur infrequently (i.e., at rates lower than can be detected in clinical trials); ability to provide data and preliminary analyses to determine the feasibility of formal studies within 4 weeks of a data request; capability to form groups (i.e., cohorts) of patients exposed to one or more drug or biologic products and to follow them for the occurrence of one or more medical outcomes; full disclosure of data collection, coding, and configuration methods to allow FDA to appropriately interpret findings; and it shall be solely the Offeror’s responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.  FDA will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers.

In providing access to longitudinal, population-based data, the Offeror shall ensure that the following criteria are met.  At a minimum, the database description shall include: number of people (active and inactive) in the database, distribution of person time by calendar year in the database, extent of geographic diversity, demographics, size of special populations of interest (including children, women of childbearing age, and elderly patients); turnover rate, and enrollment data (if applicable) for participating individuals.

In addition, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the number of years of data available overall; the lag time between the health encounter date and availability of the data; the mean, median, and range of observation time for patients in the database; and data collection and management procedures.

These longitudinal data shall have the capability to follow uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers).  Demographic information including but not limited to age and gender, health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  In addition, for each patient these data shall contain prescription drug and biologic utilization information, including the generic and brand name of the product, strength, dosage form, days supply, all dates dispensed, initial/continuing therapy indicator, quantity dispensed, instructions for use (if available), and prescriber specialty.

A one (1) year base contract with four (4), one (1) year options is intended. This RFP Number HHSF223200510010C will be available on or about April 25, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 HORIZONTAL STABILIZER 
STATEMENT OF WORK
27 SEPT 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s horizontal stabilizer  (P/N  MY20164-3, MY20331-16).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide a complete, ready-to-install HU-25 horizontal stabilizer assembly.  The repaired horizontal stabilizer must meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.1.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of horizontal stabilizer repair.  First, a “return to service repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage, replacement of bushings and hardware.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is beyond the scope of a return to service repair and would include the replacement of skins, major extrusions, and fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for inspection, parts and labor.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, original Manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul horizontal stabilizers.
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM :
1.	MY20331-16 drawings
2.	Falcon 20 Maintenance Manual , PUB: 067P, Chapter 55
3.	F20/F200 Structural Repair Manual

b.	CG Technical Orders Horizontal Stabilizer:
1.	CGTO 1U-25A-3 (Structural Repair Manual)
2.	CGTO 1U-25A-4, Chapters 55 (Illustrated Parts Catalog)
e.	Data Availability:
1.	OEM drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the Coast Guard.
2.	Coast Guard specific CGTOs can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act FOIA).Submit a written request to:

<DESC>TSA intends to negotiate separate single-source contracts with Galaxy Scientific Corporation of Egg Harbor, New Jersey and Telair International of Rancho Dominguez, California for production of Hardened Unit Load Device (HULD) units.  The HULD units will be acquired to support operational testing of the HULD Pilot Program.

TSA is negotiating single-source contracts because only these two vendors, Galaxy Scientific and Telair International, can manufacturer the HULD units.  Both firms are the only known Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for HULD units that fulfill TSA requirements, satisfy FAA airworthiness requirements and conform to international airline operational requirements.  Only these OEMs have the requisite expertise to manufacture HULD units.

TSA anticipates award of separate contracts to each OEM for HULD manufacture, repair, training and engineering support.  The period of performance for the contract will be 12 months from contract award.  Contract award is anticipated in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2005.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of PMW 180 intends to issue a Request for Proposal for the METMF(R) NEXGEN program.   METMF(R) NEXGEN is described in the attached draft Statement of Work.  This requirement has been initiated to design, fabricate, integrate, deliver and evaluate two prototype METMF(R) NEXGEN systems that will support a Milestone C Decision for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).   The METMF(R) NEXGEN will replace the legacy METMF(R) using current and emerging state-of-the-art technologies to offer greater capability, smaller size and increased mobility/scalability, which will significantly improve the provision of Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) support to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). With this announcement, the Government is soliciting industry comments on the Draft SOW.  The Government requests that industry comment on all aspects of the SOW including deliverables. The Government expects to hold an information exchange day within 60 days of this announcement.  The Government requests that all industry comments be submitted to Kim Mallis at kim.mallis@navy.mil in Microsoft Word 2000 or compatible format by close of business 5 July 2005.  Also attached to this announcement are the following files for reference: HQMC DCA METOC Requirements Ltr 30 Jan 04.pdf HQMC METOC Requirements Clarification Ltr DRAFT.doc METMF(R) ORD.doc NITES_ORD.doc

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Viral Epidemiology Branch (VEB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Baylor College of Medicine, Sections of Infectious Diseases and Health Services Research, 2002 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX  77030 for a project titled “Associations of hematologic malignancies and thyroid cancer with hepatitis C virus infection among U.S military veterans”.   Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be a cause of hematologic malignancies and thyroid cancer.  HCV infection is common among U.S. military veterans receiving care in the Veterans Administration (VA) healthcare system. The Government plans to contract with Baylor College of Medicine to assist in conducting a retrospective cohort study using nationwide VA administrative databases. Using the VA Outpatient Clinic file, Baylor shall:  1) identify a cohort of approximately 70,000 veterans treated for HCV infection in the period 1997-2004;  2) using the same database identify a comparison cohort of approximately 280,000 HCV-uninfected veterans for the same period;  3)  identify prevalent and incident cancers (hematological malignancies, thyroid cancer) and related conditions of interest using the Outpatient Clinic file and the Patient Treatment File;  4) conduct statistical analyses comparing the prevalence and incidence of these medical outcomes in the two cohorts;  and 5) conduct a validation study to evaluate the accuracy of HCV diagnoses recorded in the Outpatient Clinic file. Baylor College of Medicine, Sections of Infectious Diseases and Health Services Research has a detailed understanding of HCV infection; expertise in working with large and complex VA databases, ready access to these databases; and expertise in conducting statistical analyses.  This Group has worked extensively with these databases to study health-related outcomes of HCV infection and is part of the Houston Center for Quality of Care and Utilization Studies, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and thus has ready access to VA data files. They have computers suitable for manipulating the large data files and programmers with substantial knowledge regarding how the VA files are constructed and how to conduct appropriate statistical analyses. This contractor already has a team of data abstracters in place at the Houston VA, which can readily conduct the validation study there. Baylor is the only contractor known to the NCI Researcher who is able to conduct a field study to validate HCV diagnoses and can deliver these statistical and field study results to the Government.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 29, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The ARH will utilize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) aircraft and associated support equipment to conduct armed reconnaissance to fight for actionable combat information to enable joint/combined air-ground maneuver execution of mobile strike, close combat, an d vertical maneuver operations across the full spectrum of military operations.  The ARH will provide precision capability through lethal organic fires, dynamic employment of joint networked fires, and responsive target acquisition/identification for full spectrum, day and night operations; be rapidly deployable for global employment against a distributive, highly adaptive threat on an asymmetrical battlefield employing conventional and unconventional methods; enable the air-ground maneuver commander to 'se e-understand-act first' with a warfighter-in-the-loop to provide proactive decision making, assure critical reaction time and maneuver space, and set the conditions for the joint/combined air-ground maneuver team to 'finish decisively'.   A best value approach will be used in the source selection process.  The Government anticipates that the contract award will include an initial Cost Plus Incentive Fee effort for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase with Firm Fixed Price Op tions for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).

<DESC>This synopsis is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source award notice for commercial services. The Seattle District US Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a commercial service firm fixed price contract on a sole-source basis to crab biolog ist Dr. Eileen Visser of Perkins Point Consulting 14 Spring Street, Potsdam, NY 13676 to conduct Grays Harbor juvenile crab production monitoring in Grays Harbor, Washington.  See FedBizOpps numbered note 22.  The NAICS code for this project is 541710.  Th ere is no plan to issue a formal solicitation for this project; however, interested vendors may contact Scott Britt at scott.w.britt@usace.army.mil for an electronic copy of the Statement of Work.  The synopsis period ends at 10:00 AM June 17 to facilitate  the timely award of the contract. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The need to mitigate for Dungeness crab losses because of dredge entrainment in Grays Harbor arose in the late 1980's when Seattle District proposed the widening and deepening of the Federal navigation channel.  Studies show that incre asing juvenile crab shelter habitat by creating shell plots increases the survival of decapod crustaceans.  This contract will procure crab production monitoring and study services for a base and two option periods.  The purpose of the study is to: (1) mon itor Grays Harbor, Washington Dungeness crab production during 2005, with two option periods for 2006 and 2007, respectively, in order to evaluate progress towards crab production goals; (2) continue to investigate ways of improving the productivity of exi sting shell plots; and (3) recommend sites for shell placement in 2006.  There is a third option item for the development and implementation of a spat seeding test involving obtaining juvenile oysters (spat) from a permitted Washington State source and the  distribution of the spat to test the ability of the shell plots to become self sustaining.  Monitoring juvenile Dungeness crab productivity in Grays Harbor requires several tasks, including devising a sampling plan; identifying and preparing the experimen tal plots; sampling and collection of data; analysis of the data; preparation of a monitoring report and the submission of all deliverables.  The provision of specific technical expertise necessary to prepare an experimental plan, guide the field effort, a nd analyze the data requires an expert intimately familiar with crab biology and the Grays Harbor, Washington area.  Performing this work, the contractor shall make extensive use of existing government-provided information, current scientific literature, p revious identical studies, and existing knowledge, analytical ability, professional judgment and involvement of contractors and sub-contractors. The contractor shall complete the performance of the specific tasks outlined in the project Statement of Work.  All data, principles, theories and reports developed under this scope of work shall become property of the Government of the United States.

<DESC>Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support  services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and  ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in  delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the  aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to  perform one or more functions A – D (or E with one of the above) are invited  to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to  determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of  the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more  functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative  small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they  are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone  certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or  Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are  submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the  offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support  functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which  you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.

<DESC>The VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS), Perry Point, MD, is presently developing an acquisition strategy for a construction project to expand the existing Loch Raven Community Based Outpatient Clinic Building located at 3901 The Alameda, Baltimore, MD.  New construction will provide approximately 18,000 square feet of additional exam/treatment rooms, offices and support space for 19 additional providers.  The construction requires new space along with joining together two other buildings. This project will require a considerable amount of phasing as the current OPC must remain open during construction period services.   North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 and a size standard of $28.5 million is applicable to the contemplated acquisition.  The magnitude of the construction project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Contracting Officer is considering setting this acquisition aside exclusively for competition among Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, pursuant to the authority contained in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003.  In order for the contracting officer to set the acquisition aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, market research must be performed to ensure there are sufficient Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses available with the requisite experience, bonding capacity and capabilities to successfully perform the construction services called for.  If your firm has performance bonding capacity of over $5 million, and is capable of performing the necessary construction services for this project described above, we request that you immediately notify the contracting officer and provide her with the following information:  Company Name & Location;  Point of Contact and Telephone Number; E-Mail address for Point of Contact; Performance Bond Capacity; Number of Years in Business and Number of Employees; Average Gross Annual Receipts for the preceding three years; Largest construction contract (by dollar amount) performed to date;  Date of contract, amount and point of contact that can verify past performance, along with telephone number, etc; Three most recently completed construction projects (dates, amounts, points-of-contact); Information on any construction contracts involving health care facilities; and any construction contracts currently being performed.  Please note that this is not a Request for Proposal, an Invitation to Bid, or a Request for Quote.  The Government is seeking information for market research purposes only.  If you have previously submitted this information to the Contracting Officer, you are not required to do so again.  The Government may or may not issue solicitation documents.  Contact: Carol L. Pomraning, Contracting Officer, phone (410) 642-1043, fax (410) 642-1102, or email carol.pomraning@va.gov.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research.   

The Government intends to establish a new contract under sole source procurement procedures with the OEM for the procurement to modify the Minuteman III (MM III) Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) Test Set (MPTS)-1 in order to integrate the MPTS-1 into building 1833 at Hill AFB, Utah.  This modification is required to support the MM III PSRE Aging Surveillance Program.  The modification required to integrate the MPTS-1 into building 1833 would involve:  (1) the modification of the MPTS-1 test software to provide aging surveillance testing for multiple PSREs and component set-ups, (2) the design and manufacture of a new cable assembly to connect the MPTS-1 to building 1833, and (3) the design and manufacture of hardware items (a distribution panel and more cable assemblies) to interface the MPTS-1 to the PSREs and components under test.

The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to the OEM, ATTI  

 

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification:  Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   

 

Subject to the Government’s consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services, should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding  of the requirements; 2) employees with satisfactory qualifications; and 3) appropriate experience with the MPTS-1 to be able to conduct these services required without technical, schedule or cost risk to the 526th ICBMSW prior to contract award.     

 

A Determination by the Government not to proceed with a sole source procurement for the proposed contract action will be based upon responses and information received to this announcement and will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a sole source procurement.

During the development of the current Maryland agreement, Dr. Leslie has supplied invaluable expertise in a wide range of services, all central to addressing the issue of whether there are remnants of the former de jure segregated system of higher education in the area of the allocation of funding resources pursuant to the current agreement with OCR regarding Maryland's HBCUs, Bowie State University, Coppin State College, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and Morgan State University and it's traditionally white institutions,  including but not limited to, University of Maryland College Park, University of Maryland Baltimore County, University of Maryland Baltimore, University of Baltimore, Towson University, Salisbury State University and Frostburg State University.  Given the unique qualifications required and immediate need for the service, Dr. Larry Leslie, services are required to provide the consultative services needed on the issue of the allocation of funding resources as it relates to a determination of whether there are vestiges of the de jure segregated system of higher education in Maryland. 

It is determined that only one source is reasonably available for this effort. Sole Source authority FAR 13.106-1 is applicable.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact on or before the response due date. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in ED's assessment of capable sources.  If an acceptable response is not received by response due date, ED will initiate negotiations with Dr. Leslie.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 5 each Air Data Display Unit (ADDU), Model #9D-80130-46. This item is being purchased for the NOAA/Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida. The WP-3D Navigation Systems Project is the first major upgrade to the avionics of the WP-3D aircraft since they were purchased new in 1975/76. This upgrade includes replacing 16 major avionics systems to improve the reliability and performance of the Inertial Navigation System, and to meet the U.S. and international regulatory requirements for communications and safety systems.  In order to achieve all of the project design goals, AOC has relied heavily on the extensive engineering performed by the Navy and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on their fleets of P-3 aircraft, saving NOAA many millions in non-curing engineering expense.

Current CMS and Related Software  

The current CMS infrastructure is a mainframe-based program that acts as the core system for work order processing, preventive maintenance activities, equipment history, purchase request generation and customer billing.  The core system exports data into other management tools such as Primavera and an MS Access database designed for project management purposes.  The core data is then supplemented and used for various project management and reporting purposes. The core system also interacts with NCI-Frederick’s demographic database to verify employee information, the property accountability system to import certain equipment data, the supply warehouse for material requisitions and a client server based financial management system for procurement, cost collection, and billing.  Other MS Access databases, associated with FME work activities, have been designed and are used for tracking or other management related purposes.  

Purpose for CMS Replacement and Software Consolidation 

The purpose for replacing the current CMS is as follows:
(1)	Consolidate the functions of the following applications by migrating to a server controlled single software application.
CMS:						ADABAS
Warehouse & Inventory Control System (WICS):	ADABAS

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO PRE-QUALIFY VENDORS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The United States Senate Sergeant at Arms is seeking information on Call Center support services, following a catastrophic event impacting the National Capitol Region (NCR).  The SAA invites all qualified sources to respond to this sources sought notice.  In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses the items listed in the Requirements and Instructions sections of this document. Requirements:  (1) Experience: The vendor must demonstrate their experience, within the last five years, in rapidly standing up and manning a Call Center in response to a medium to large-scale emergency.  The vendor must have demonstrated ability to: a) quickly establish Call Center services; b) maintain those services for an extended period of time; c) staff the Call Center with trained mental health professionals who are able to deal with the complex needs of distraught and grieving callers; d) provide a dedicated number in advance of a disaster, to which a toll-free, publicized number could be directed.  An hourly call capacity of over 3,000 is required, and the ability to augment these phone services with a website; e) provide a system to input, remotely access, and maintain data received via phone calls; and f) provide translation capabilities and the ability to receive international calls.  (2) Past Performance: The vendor must provide three past performance references relevant to  requirements a) through f) above along with complete and current contact information ( customer name, project name/contract number, address, contact name, phone number and email) for five past customers; the Senate will check references as necessary to evaluate past performance.  Both experience and past performance will be evaluated on the basis of its breadth and depth, its similarity to the Senate project as well as the satisfaction of clients and overall quality of services represented by the projects described.  (3) Staffing: With the exception of those individuals performing translation services, the staff assigned to this project must be United States citizens.  All staff must have specialized training in mental health.  Because staff will be handling personal data from incoming callers, a criminal background check shall be required for each operator.  (4) Location: The Vendor must be capable of providing a Call Center located within the 48 contiguous states.  Instructions: Responses to this sources sought request are due to the POC no later than June 30, 2005 at 12:00 Noon EDT and shall be submitted electronically via email only to the attention of Kathleen M. Haddow at acquisitions@saa.senate.gov.  No other method of transmittal will be accepted. The response shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Pages over the page limitation will be discarded. The subject line of the email message shall be 2005-S-065 Call Center Support.  Access to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party.  The SAA is not responsible for any failure to access information.  The information supplied in response to this sources sought notice will be used to pre-qualify firms that will be invited to submit proposals.  Firms responding to this sources sought notice and deemed qualified by the SAA will be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Only pre-qualified firms will be permitted to submit proposals.    If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the SAA anticipates release of a solicitation in July 2005.  The Senate or the SAA will not be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this announcement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SAA OR U.S. SENATE.

<DESC>6/15/2005 - By: Frederick M Dini The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence and Space (PEO C4I & Space) and Program Office PMW 160 is seeking information on the Increment (INC) III phase of the Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) program. The Navy is seeking information on the best method to transform the Navyâ€™s current ADNS program from a partially serial data and partially Internet Protocol (IP) data system to an all IP system.  The Navy anticipates awarding two contracts; the first is an RDT&E contract (2 awards) to design a network architecture that will converge all current voice, video, and data circuits to a â€œNativeâ€ IP Network and the second contract is for actual production of the INC III system. It is anticipated that the system maximizes the use of currently available Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) components into an integrated network design.

<DESC>Sources Sought for study to increase the sample size available for estimating the abundance of Hawaiian false killer whales, and other small odontocetes as well as examining inter-island movements and stock structure with field efforts off the inlands of Kauai and Ni'ihau.

Background:
The Hawaiian stock of false killer whales is currently considered strategic under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, as takes in the Hawaiian long-line fishery exceed the calculated Potential Biological Removal level. Two population estimates currently exist from Hawaiian waters, one for the entire EEZ (268 individuals with a CV of 1.08), and one for the waters around the main Hawaiian (121 individuals with a CV of 0.47). Efforts are currently underway to estimate population size and examine stock structure (e.g., inter-island movements) around the main Hawaiian Islands, using mark-recapture analyses of individuals photographically identified from 2000 through 2004. As false killer whales are infrequently encountered, sample sizes for existing mark-recapture analyses are small, and individuals have not been photographically identified off all of the main Hawaiian Islands (animals have been primarily photographed off Oahu and east to Hawaii).

<SUBJECT>N -- Energy Management and Control System
<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract for installation of Direct Digital Controls/Energy Management Control System to four facilities at Beale AFB, California as a direct award to Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.  The contractor will provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment and labor.  This solicitation is a sole source award under FAR 6.302-1.  

Siemens has been the current contractor for the DDC/EMCS system at Beale AFB since 21 March 2003.  Market research has established Siemens as the only known capable company, which can provide building automation to fulfill the Beale AFB requirement. 

The DDC at Beale AFB is an Apogee Insight system manufactured solely by Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.  Siemens has no authorized distributors.  Beale AFB currently has 60 facilities, with 22,000 points and 80-field panels on-line with this system.  The Apogee Insight system (hardware and software is proprietary in nature).  In order to maintain coordinated system growth, consistency and lower training costs, all DDC support system procurement must be Apogee Insight.  This requirement is part of that upgrade.  Therefore, it is not in the government’s best interest to introduce a potentially new contractor during this transition.  A new contractor could result in untimely delays of service and potential man-hours lost in training.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334512.  The small business standard is 500 employees.  The entire solicitation will be released as “other than full and open” solely on the Electronic Posting System (EPS), www.eps.gov, (paper copies will not be available).  This award is based on the availability of funds before September 30, 2005.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Government Publishing Services Opportunity Request for Information
<DESC><p>GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING SERVICES OPPORTUNITY - 
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>


<p>This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only! </p>

<p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is currently evaluating the functions related to its Sales and Agency Distribution Programs and is seeking alternative revenue sharing models that could be provided by the private sector.  GPO is interested in increasing public awareness of its products, enhancing customer access for broader dissemination, expanding distribution channels, and utilizing advanced technologies for the sale, production and distribution of print and tangible publications to the public.  GPO is requesting information to determine the types of innovative ideas that private vendors would utilize to provide some or all of the services for a sales and/or agency distribution program.  This information will be used to determine the best way to collaboratively structure the Sales and Agency Distribution Programs to enhance the sale and distribution of official tangible publications, to achieve cost reductions, and to move the official GPO brand into mainstream information dissemination channels. </p>

BACKGROUND: 

<p>The GPO is the Federal government’s primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms.  Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and government agencies a set of centralized services that enables them to easily and cost effectively produce printed documents.  In addition, GPO has offered these publications for sale to the general public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program. </p>

<p>Currently, the public can purchase items through the GPO by placing orders via telephone, fax, mail, the Online Bookstore (http://bookstore.gpo.gov/), by visiting the GPO Bookstore in Washington D.C., or through the Federal Citizens Information Center in Pueblo, CO (http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/).  Orders are shipped primarily through GPO’s distribution facilities in Laurel, MD and Pueblo, CO.  Some items are shipped from GPO’s bindery line and/or its contract printers. </p>

<p>Currently there are over 3,000 active publications with physical inventory available for sale through the GPO for an average price of $25.  Traditionally, the bulk of the copies for the sales inventory have been printed as part of an offset print run, though the Sales Program is moving away from maintaining a print inventory and towards a print-on-demand (POD) framework.  No inventory is kept for the POD publications as they are printed from press optimized pdf files once ordered by a customer.  A repository of print-on-demand masters is being created for all information products that fit the technological criteria of POD.  Implementation of POD has enabled GPO to increase its current publication title offerings by more than 1,600 additional titles.  By utilizing POD technology, GPO is able to greatly increase the number of titles available for sale each year, reduce physical inventory, reduce its distribution in print costs and keep an expanded list of titles indefinitely. </p>

<p>Publications available from GPO cover a broad range of subjects, anything from aviation to health care to education, and are classified using current BISAC Subject Headings.  Some of the bestselling publications have traditionally been The United States Government Manual, The Occupational Outlook Handbook, and The Constitution of the United States & The Declaration of Independence.  GPO also sells items in a variety of formats, including CD-ROMS, posters, pamphlets, microfiche, and maps.</p> 

<p>In addition, the GPO has over 200 subscriptions for sale.  In FY 2004, there were approximately 160,000 paid subscribers for these titles.  Subscriptions fall into one of three categories: dated periodicals, irregular subscriptions, and basics & supplements.  Dated periodicals are released on a regular frequency.  Irregular subscriptions consist of a set number of issues or volumes however there is no predetermined release schedule.  Basic & supplement subscribers will receive the basic volume and then will receive any supplements to it as they are published.  Some of the more popular subscriptions are the Code of Federal Regulations, FDA Consumer, and The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.</p> 

<p>Although some of the inventory items are printed in GPO facilities, the vast majority is procured by GPO from private printers throughout the United States.  The GPO prints or procures approximately 300,000 print jobs a year for its Federal agency customers.  As each job is ordered by an agency, an Information Specialist reviews the item to determine its potential for inclusion in the Sales Program based on whether it would be of interest to the public.  Traditionally, additional copies are printed for the Sales Program along with the agency’s order with the added advantage of incremental pricing.  Historically, approximately 1,200 new titles are selected for printing by the Sales Program each year; however, many more titles could be offered for sale utilizing the POD technology.</p> 

<p>Once printed, titles that are not directly distributed or set up for POD are sent to a GPO facility for warehousing and distribution. These facilities handle the fulfillment of orders coming in via telephone, fax, mail, and the Online Bookstore.  Distribution statistics for both the Laurel, MD, and Pueblo, CO, facilities can be found in Appendix A.</p> 

<p>In FY 2004, GPO’s Sales Program distributed nearly 4.5 million sales copies to its customers, primarily from the distribution facility in Laurel, MD.  About 23% of the orders received are for two or more individual titles.  In FY 2004, the Sales Program earned almost $25 million dollars in revenue.  Cost of goods sold was equal to 24.7% of this amount.</p> 

<p>In addition, GPO also performs distribution work for other agencies on a reimbursable basis as a part of its Agency Distribution Program.  GPO distributed almost 18 million copies in FY 2004 on a reimbursable basis.  The majority, close to 14.5 million, of the copies was distributed out of the facility in Pueblo.  A large portion of the work performed at Pueblo is on the behalf of GSA’s Federal Citizens Information Center and consists of pamphlet mailings.</p> 

<p>GPO markets to a wide variety of customers, many of whom are purchasing government information as a reference or guidance tool for the workplace.  These individuals are employed at a wide variety of places including libraries, government agencies, businesses, and law firms.  Consistent purchasers of government publications have been the public, academic, law, special, school, and government agency libraries that buy the GPO’s major subscription and serial publications. GPO has long standing relationships with a number of resellers. It also sells directly to private citizens.  Military history publications, national park books, and Senate art publications are among those that appeal to the retail market.</p> 

<p>OPPORTUNITY: </p>

<p>Operating as a Government agency, the GPO has been limited in its ability to aggressively promote its information products and services.  As information that had traditionally been produced in print has migrated to the Internet, the GPO has been slow to evolve and refine its services to meet the changing needs of the public.  In addition, GPO has not effectively participated in channels that would help increase visibility and distribution of its offerings to new markets, but is now producing and distributing ONIX records to increase awareness of the wide variety of publications that it offers.  Although less than five percent of current sales are to wholesale book dealers, GPO has recently expanded efforts to increase sales to wholesale markets using advance sales and volume discounts. GPO believes that there is a significant opportunity for increased revenue from sales to the general public and resellers with improved marketing and better use of available channels.</p> 

<p>It is no longer economically feasible for GPO to continue to operate its Sales and Agency Distribution Programs using its traditional methods.  Therefore, GPO is seeking alternative models for its Sales and Agency Distribution Programs that could be provided by innovative relationships with the private sector.  GPO is interested in increasing public awareness of its official tangible publications, enhancing customer access for broader dissemination, expanding distribution channels, and utilizing advanced technologies for the sale, production and distribution of print and tangible publications to the public, its traditional customers and resellers.  Ideally, the vendor establishing a relationship with the GPO would serve as the “Official Agent” of the GPO funded through revenue sharing.  GPO anticipates working with the vendor in some limited aspects and is open to ideas on how this relationship could be developed.  GPO could also coordinate the use of internal GPO or GPO contract printing to obtain the initial quantities that the vendor requires, as well as providing for the use of its repository of press optimized pdf files for POD production of publications.  Through innovative relationships with the private sector, the GPO hopes to achieve its core mission of “Keeping America Informed” more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p> 

<p>GPO is seeking an “Official Agent” to perform the duties of its Sales and/or Agency Distribution Programs and be the primary distributor for official, authentic government content on a revenue sharing basis.  Keeping GPO’s goals in mind, please outline how your organization would perform the services of a sales and/or agency distribution program.  Services may include but are not limited to the following: inventory acquisition and management, sales, marketing, order processing and fulfillment, customer support, storage, and distribution.</p> 

<p>Vendors are hereby requested to submit a statement by May 4, 2005 detailing the approach they would take to perform all or part of the services of a sales and/or agency distribution program.  Please include company points of contact, and GSA Schedule number (if applicable).  Special attention will be paid to the following key ideas in the responses:</p> 


<p>1.  How will you advance GPO's core mission of "Keeping America Informed" through your involvement as an "Official Agent" of the GPO? </p>
<p>2.  What are some innovative ideas you will implement to enhance the overall distribution of tangible government information?</p> 
<p>3.  Given the approaches that you've described above, what sort of contractual relationship do you anticipate having with GPO and what form of revenue sharing do you foresee? </p>
<p>4.  Why do you feel that your company is especially qualified for this Government Publishing Services Opportunity? </p>

<p>Prior to the release of any formal request for proposals (RFP), GPO will be conducting an informational meeting at its headquarters in Washington, DC.  GPO will extend invitations to those vendors who demonstrate the potential to make a positive contribution to the dialogue based on their response to this RFI. </p>
 
<p>This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate the GPO in any way.  This is not a request for proposal and the GPO will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. </p>

<p>For additional information concerning the Government Publishing Services Opportunity please refer to:  http://www.gpo.gov/salesprogramrfi/. GPO encourages all interested vendors to register on this website so that they can be notified via e-mail when updates are posted.</p>

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

POSITION TITLE:   Democracy and Governance Field Advisor for USAID Democracy and Governance Office 
MARKET VALUE:  $74,782 - $97,213 per 2005 Federal cost of living adjustment

I.  STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG) is one of the larger offices of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (DCHA/DG). DCHA/DG has a staff of 73 including direct hires and others.  It is the successor office of the Center for Democracy and Governance that was created in 1994 to provide technical support and guidance to USAID, especially to field missions. DCHA/DG also has an important directive, as did the old Center, to train and strengthen the Agency’s cadre of democracy officers. The Office is also charged with managing three congressionally mandated funds grouped together under the rubric of Special Programs to Address the Needs of Survivors (SPANS). 

The DG Office consists of:  Rule of Law, Elections and Political Processes; Civil Society; and Governance- a Strategies Division; a Program and Information Team, and a SPANS team.  The Strategies Division coordinates the DG Office’s backstopping of field missions and regional bureaus, and works with these operating units to improve the quality of their democratic governance activities. The Program Division also reviews democracy and governance programs to learn from past experiences with a view to improving the Agency’s know-how in program design and implementation.  The Program and Information Team supports the office’s program function; that is, it manages the office’s budgeting and procurement processes, reporting, and collects certain statistic information about Agency democracy and governance programs.  The subject position will likely start within, but not necessarily be limited to, a new crisis stabilization unit;  responsibilities will b geographically “world-wide,” varied and dynamic, to reflect changing circumstances facing USAID, he DG office, as well as any changing composition of the team.

As a technical office in a pillar bureau, DCHA/DG has also been given the task of being prepared to respond quickly to the failure of governance in weak states such as the collapse of the state in Afghanistan and Iraq. In such situations, technical assistance by DCHA/DG for the timely and punctuated interventions is critical. By definition a failed state is one without governance. For this reason the DG Office, plans to hire one U.S. citizen personal services contractor (USPSC) to be available to deploy to provide fast and flexible assistance targeted at the restoration or establishment of democratic governance. The deployment will be to the affected country and can last from several weeks to as long as one year. When not deployed the PSC's will be integrated into the regular DCHA/DG staff and will work under the direction of the division or team leader to which they are assigned by the DG Office Director. 

For more information about DCHA/DG and its activities, please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance.
 

POSITION OVERVIEW

The worldwide nature of DG's program requires a DG Field Advisor who can provide immediate consultation on DG projects. The proper execution of DG programs demands that an individual with managerial and operational skills is available for short-term critical work in Washington and the field, determined on a case by case basis, to perform specific operational and advisory functions.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This is a position requiring excellent management skills, a high degree of communications skills and negotiation ability to serve as a liaison between the Office of Democracy and Governance DCHA, USAID Washington, and the USAID Mission, Representative or the US Ambassador (in the absence of a USAID Mission). The incumbent will be sent, on an as needed basis, to a wide range of DG project sites and proposed new country program sites.  In some geographic locations this individual will be called upon to work with officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and non-governmental organizations.  The DG Field Advisor will report to the Deputy Director/Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) or his/her designee.

In the capacity of DG Field Advisor the incumbent will be responsible for the following types of activities abroad where DG country programs are in place: assessing the needs of the DG program, evaluating the work of the grantee, and ensuring the various USG interests are coordinated and policy implemented. The Field Advisor will consult with the Deputy Director/CTO, or designee, on a regular basis to develop a clear and coherent basis from which to implement programmatic changes and needs.  Assisting in Washington and/or the field with new country program start-ups, providing operational support in periods of need, review and evaluation of ongoing projects, and country-program closeouts will be of particular importance in the work of the Field Advisor.

The Field Advisor will, as necessary:

*	Conduct, with in-country representatives, visits to field sites in areas where DG has projects 

*	Fill critical staffing needs in Washington including the provision of support to new country start-ups and on-call technical assistance 

*	Assess the status of micro-projects and report on all coordination activities and command structures, including the effectiveness of each site's operations

*	Review and monitor the plans and activities of any DG grantee and ensure coordination of grantee programs with USAID mission and other international organizations

*	Execute other closeout activities related to DG programs and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of DG programs in the field.

In new country programs, the DG Field Advisor will as necessary:

*	Participate in assessing the feasibility of the country as a potential candidate for an DG program
*	Participate in conceptualizing and designing the country program, with project managers of DG and its grantees

*	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department to ensure program and policy direction

*	Within the guidelines provided by the relevant DG/Washington Team Leader, negotiate program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts

*	Develop relationships with NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and others interested in the DG country program;

*	Assess project sites and participate in selecting contractors and grantees to work under DG's country program;

*	In close collaboration with the relevant DG/Washington Team Leader, assist the development of DG strategies and policies for the country
	
*	Monitor and evaluate the country program, individual projects, and contractor and grantee performance

*	Perform other duties as assigned

WORK ENVIRONMENT
Because of the need for quick response and creativity in complex situations, the Field Advisor is expected to operate with autonomy, responsibility and authority. The sensitive nature of the work demands that the incumbent be an individual with good skills of social interaction and a skilled interpreter of politically charged situations.  Since work may require continued changes in program direction, implementation and coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.

DESCRIPTION:

The contractor in conjunction with FKNMS staff will provide the personnel, equipment, and vessel required to complete the following tasks necessary to redress and stabilize approximately 20 square meters of living coral within the Newfound Harbor Keys area.  This area includes a Sanctuary Preservation Area (SPA) and is located ocean-side of Big Pine Key in the lower Florida Keys.  Through the use of SCUBA or snorkel equipment, the contractor shall provide redress and stabilization of coral reefs per the minimum requirements shown herein.

Requirements:

Minimum Requirements:

Task 1

Locate, upright, and position coral and framework fragments available for restabilization previously identified through assessments conducted by FKNMS staff.  The estimated number of coral fragments to be reattached is 60-75 (excluding framework).

Task 2

Prepare substrate for each individual fragment (attachment site) for reattachment, using the necessary tools to clean the surfaces of substrate/coral/framework to be in contact with the stabilizing cement mixture.  Preparation will make certain each location is free of any algae or other “fouling” material to ensure the fragments will be secure.

Task 3

Reattach coral and framework fragments using cement and molding plaster mixture (or other mixture) appropriately formulated for local environmental/marine conditions.  It may be necessary to use quarried limestone rock and/or some of the compromised framework fragments to assist in stabilizing the coral due to the structural complexity of the affected species.  This task will carefully mimic the aesthetic value of the surrounding area by making every reasonable effort to eliminate (minimize) a “manmade” appearance to the finished product.  The surrounding area will be observed by the contractor for excess residue settling on other live corals, and will be hand fanned to remove the material from the living coral tissue.

Task 4

Photograph / video the “before and after” restoration effort using high resolution, digital underwater photography.  The photos / video will be included in the final report in both color hard copy and digital formats.

Task 5

A detailed report – including written description of all activities conducted, photo-documentation, and site-specific information (i.e., number of corals and framework fragments stabilized, species composition, GPS locations, geospatial maps, amount of concrete used, problems encountered, etc.).  The final report (3 copies) will be due to the FKNMS no less than 60 days after the project is accepted as complete by the FKNMS.

Special Conditions

The FKNMS will specify materials and methods used.  FKNMS staff will accompany contractor during all phases of operation to ensure work is performed in a similar manner with previous restoration efforts.  The work is expected to commence as soon as feasible following award, and is expected to be completed 2 – 4 weeks following start date (weather dependent).  FKNMS will not pay for weather delays.

The work will be performed using the FKNMS Management Permit, which allows this type of activity.  Any work performed by the vendor without FKNMS staff present will not be covered under the permit and shall be subject to legal action.  Contractor will provide proof of insurance for SCUBA activities and commercial vessel operation.  The contractor will provide all equipment necessary to perform the tasks described herein.

There are no benefits and the contractor is responsible for payroll taxes and insurance including medical.  The contractor shall not be deemed a Federal employee for any purposes including Federal Tort Claims Act and Federal Employee Compensation Act purposes.

Offers should be based on a fixed cost and include mobilization and de-mobilization, field operations, equipment, report production, and associated activities, including consumables.  Selection will be made based on best value to the Government

NOTE:  THE ABOVE ARE MIMUMUM REQUIREMENTS.

The New Mexico Veterans Administration Health Care System (NMVAHCS), 1501 San Pedro Blvd SE, Albuquerque, NM 87108, is soliciting for a sole source delivery order to provide NYMOX Nicalert Urine Screen strips in support of Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Research # 519 for the VA Cooperative Studies Program, 2401 Centre Ave SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106-4180.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation as a Request for Proposal (RFP). A written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  The RFP 501-0042-05 number should be referenced on all proposals.  The VA intends a sole source request to award a Firm Fixed Price Definite Quantity Delivery Requirements Order for NYMOX NicAlert Urine Screen Strips Manufactured by NYMOX.

If an individual has been exposed to second hand smoke, the NicAlert can identify levels depending on the exposure. The technology that is used in the NicAlert test strip involves the immunochromatographic assay.  This assay uses monoclonal antibody-coated gold particles and a series of avidity traps that allow quantification.  The sample collection end of the strip contains gold particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to cotinine, a relatively long-lived metabolite of nicotine.  The distance the gold migrates on the strip is shown by a clear color change and provides an accurate measure of the amount of cotinine in the sample.  The positive and negative controls are human urine-based liquid and are ready to use when taken out of their packaging.  The estimated requirement is for approximately 4500 strips delivered over a two year period.

***Statement of Work for Modification and Repair to (2) paint booths***

Scope
The primary objective of this Statement of Work is to provide an outline of the modifications to be performed and repairs needed to return the two paint booths to a fully functional condition.

·	Travis AFB, Bldg 803
o	Paint Spray Booth, 2 each 


Basic Services
The vendor will be required to perform all modifications, repairs, or service to the two locally manufactured paint booths’ current exhaust ventilation systems, which are not performing to the requirements of the shape and size of the booths. The current design of the paint booths and filter systems do not allow for the proper volume of air flow and filtration required to protect the carbon filter bank from dust contaminates. In addition, the make-up air is overpowering the exhaust air and pushing the entry doors open. 

Booth description  
The current design of the two paint booths are shown in the attached pictures along with this description. The booths have two man doors each on either side, for a total of four personnel entry points. Each end of the paint booth has a double bi-fold door that goes from floor to top of the booth.  Each booth has an overhead carbon filter bank containing a total of  40, 20” X 20” filters each. The current particle filtration system is single stage with a carbon filter bank at the end of the line and a total of 28- 20” x 20” exhaust filters each at the front of the system (14 on each side) per booth with the ducting on the outside of the booth running up the side walls to the carbon bank. The banks are exhausted by a 20 horse 3 phase 2 speed 20” exhaust fan on each of the two carbon filter banks. Each booth has airline regulators and connections at all four corners. Each booth is equipped with an overpressure / heater fan system placed on top of its respective booth. Along the side walls are 4’ florescent lights (see pictures for details).  The booths are constructed of galvanized steel.  Booth #1 is 15 feet wide, 36 feet long and 24 feet high; booth #2 is 15 feet wide, 46 feet long and 24 feet high. Both are attached to a concrete floor. 
 
Required modifications/ repairs
·	The four man doors need a new latch similar to a walk-in freezer style, as shown in one of the attached pictures. Heavy duty

·	The overhead carbon filter banks containing a total of 40 each 20” X 20” will need to be emptied and new carbon placed in these filter boxes.   

·	The booths will require a complete modification of the total number of filters and the ducting system as follows: 

·	56 additional filters to equal a total of 84 per booth need to be installed.  All additions to the booths will be made to the outside of the booth as space is limited on the inside walls.
 
·	Each re-designed filter bank must be of a triple filter design… i.e. 
a)	STAGE ONE	a pre filter cloth (rolled over stage two and three)
b)	STAGE TWO	a standard fiber 20 X 20 filter 
c)	STAGE THREE	a triple pocket filter

Both exhaust motors will be replaced with a new 20 inch 50 horse power motor three phase two speed, vendor provided.  Second speed will be slower to allow for heated air flow to be reduced, improving dry time of parts painted. (Old fans and motors are to be used, if applicable, as trade-in-value towards the overall purchase).

·	Additional ducting to be routed for the increase of air flow volume through the exhaust filters. All old ducting to be vacuumed out and waste disposed of using government supplied containers (see “The Government will provide” for further details).

·	All lighting needing to be moved due to ducting/ filter placement will be relocated.  Relocation is required to prevent loss of existing total candle power.   

·	Vendor will perform a function test for all equipment upon completion of project. 

·	If any work requires deactivating or moving of any fire suppression nozzle/bottle from its current location, vendor will insure all fire suppression systems are in working order. The system is a pressurized dry chemical system. Original vendor for fire suppression was Code Three, located on railroad Ave. Suisun city Ca. 94585   

·	All air lines moved or disconnected will be placed in an appropriate area as required by booth position and filter modification and returned to a working order. 

Travel
 The contractor shall arrange and execute all travel necessary for the performance of the requirements in this SOW. 

The Government will provide:
·	The government will provide containers and disposal for all current hazardous materials created by both paint booths prior the start of any repairs or modifications.  This is to include, but not limited to, the paint dust from inside the ducting, all carbon in the carbon filter boxes, current used filters, paper within the booths. 
·	In addition, power outlets at 115 volts, lighting and stands and/or platforms (not to include any scaffolding).  A single point of contact will be provided to vendor for all modifications to be performed.

PRINCIPLE STATEMENT OF WORK

(1) The contractor shall provide an overall conceptual engineering design of a research wind tunnel to meet the specifications given.  The contractor shall provide a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to the AF. Following the PDR, and with AF approval, the contractor shall proceed and complete the design that includes all construction details and notes on drawings.  Upon successful completion of the PDR, the contractor shall submit final engineering drawings to the AF for approval and authorization to proceed (ATP).  The design must comply with all applicable State Codes, City Ordinances, Factory Mutual Insurance Company requirements, and all agencies having jurisdiction over this job.  Any required permits are the responsibility of the contractor.

(2) The contractor shall design and manufacture a research wind tunnel to AF specifications.  The contractor shall provide bi-weekly status reports to the AF focal point and allow AF representatives to visit the contractor at any time to review the design and/or inspect the wind tunnel during its manufacture.  Upon completion of the wind tunnel fabrication, the contractor shall provide as-built drawings.  Bidders shall specify whether an operational checkout at the manufacturing site will be performed.  The contractor shall also provide a written summary of the operational checkout of the wind tunnel (if performed).  The AF or a designated representative will perform a buyoff inspection at the contractor’s location prior to shipping.  On AF approval, the contractor shall package and ship the wind tunnel to the installation site in Pomona, California.

(3) The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-type designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, seen in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/, will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is shown in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation in the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

(4) The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

(5) The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2” in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20” from the first.

(6) The contractor shall provide calibration data to correlate control panel speed setting to test section air velocity for clear test section.

(7) The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.

(8) The contractor shall provide two complete sets of documentation describing the operation and maintenance of the wind tunnel and all support equipment.

(9) The contractor shall provide printed engineering drawings, 2-D and 3-D in AutoCAD, of the as-built wind tunnel facility on E-size drawings (28" x 40") and electronic drawing files on CD-ROM.  Electronic drawing files shall be provided in both .pdf format as well as AutoCAD or IGES format.

OPTIONAL STATEMENT OF WORK

Contractors shall perform the following tasks that consist of enhancements to the principal statement of work.  

(1) The contractor shall purchase and install a water cooling tower and pump system to provide chilled water to the wind tunnel.  The contractor shall size the system to maintain wind tunnel temperature at ambient +/- 5 degrees F.  Local ambient temperatures range from 50 to 105 degrees F.  It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise by 25 degrees F above ambient during a typical run.  The contractor shall install the tower at an AF approved location near the wind tunnel, make all required hookups (electrical, water, etc.), check out operation and obtain all of the required permits.  

(2) Improve flow quality in the test section from those specified in above (Principle Statement of Work) to - Flow uniformity:  0.25% variation from average velocity or less; Turbulence:  0.07% turbulence intensity or less; Flow angularity:  *0.1 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section).

These are maximum values allowed at the array of points specified in the flow calibration of the test section described in the principle statement of work.

To achieve this improved flow quality, it is recommended that Items a - c below be considered.

(a) The contractor shall add two additional screens, after the honeycomb and before the contraction cone to improve flow uniformity in the test section.

(b) The contractor shall add a constant section, of length equal to one effective diameter of the tunnel at that location, between turn 4 and the contraction cone to improve flow quality in the test section.

(c) The contractor shall add corner fillets to all four corners of the test section, with proper fairings upstream and downstream of the test section, to improve flow quality in the test section. Fillets are to be such as to account for growth of the boundary layers on the walls of the test section. Therefore, the test section walls shall be parallel, in pairs.

(3) The contractor shall install lights in the test section fillets, 4 places, to improve lighting in the test section.

(4) The contractor shall provide and install noise reduction equipment (acoustic silencers) inside the wind tunnel to reduce the level of wind tunnel noise. The contractor shall specify the noise level reduction provided by the silencers (dBA) at 100, 200 and 300 ft/sec.

(5) The contractor shall provide automatic controls of wind tunnel parameters including dynamic pressure (q), temperature, model pitch, and model yaw.  Analog voltages will be available from the model support system for pitch and yaw.  The AF will provide the needed programming in LabVIEW.

(6) The contractor shall provide a comparison of costs for alternative wind tunnel construction materials (fiberglass, wood, other) and include a durability warranty extension statement.  The contractor shall make recommendations based on expected operating conditions: moderate climate, dry, windy, direct sunlight (20 – 105 degrees Fahrenheit), earthquake-proof, etc.

(7) The contractor shall provide a motorized 3-D traversing mechanism that will be mounted inside and at the downstream end of the test section and allow for flow measurements throughout most of the test section (for example the detailed calibration of the test section flow, as described on top of page 5).

(8) The contractor shall design the test section to be easily removable, interchangeable and portable and supply one additional removable test sections for 2-D airfoil testing.  Maximum airfoil cord length will be 12" and the mounting will be a single position in the center of the section.

(9) The contractor shall provide computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the flow in the test section and tunnel circuit.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 The purpose for this amendment is to provide response to the following vendor questions: 1.  Is Web-based registration an option or requirement for this conference?  If so, does the requirement need to be a COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) application?  Does it need to be 508 Compliant? This is a performance-based requirement; the Government is relying upon the expertise of the offeror, as demonstrated in the proposal. 2.  Is Online Credit Card processing an option or requirement for this conference? This is a performance-based requirement; the Government is relying upon the expertise of the offeror, as demonstrated in the proposal. 3.  I would like to know with regards to the above solicitation if there is a preference for day of the week for this full two day event.  I am assuming this will encompass either three or four days since there is an evening kickoff, followed by two full d ays and then checkout on the fourth day.  This is an important aspect with regards to finding space and to ensure the appropriate time of the year.  This conference is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2006.  Is there any time of the year between now a nd June 2006 which is preferred? There is really no specific date that we are looking for other than having the conference completed before preparations for fiscal year end begin.    4.  In accordance to the definition provided in FAR Part 2, for performance based contracts:  Performance-based contracting means structuring all aspects of an acquisition around the purpose of the work to performed with the contract requirements set fort h in clear, specific, and objective terms with measurable outcomes as opposed to either the manner by which the work is to be performed or broad and imprecise statement of work, we are concerned, due to the lack of clear and specific requirements, as to h ow any offeror can be expect to provide a firm fixed price for this work.  Based on the three-time past history for this conference, can you not provide more specific information to the potential offerors? While past experience is not necessarily an indicator of the future, it is provided as a reference.  The last conference 21-23 June 2004 in Baltimore, where we had approximately 600 professionals from industry, government, and academia and 98 exhibitors. The cost for exhibitors was Industry - $2250; Government - $1250; and Small Business - $1250.  Attendee costs were:  Industry - $895; Government - $595; and Small Business (less than 100 employees) - $595.  Exhibitors received one conference pass and one e xhibitor only pass.  Our feedback from industry (mostly small businesses) was that attendee costs were too high.  Our purpose for final approval was to ensure that attendance costs were not too high to be cost prohibitive to industry.  We had three breakou t tracks in 2004; Procurement and Business Access; Medical Research, Technology and Logistics Activities (Trends and Opportunities); R&D Technology Transfer.  2001 Conference:  May 2001 in Lancaster, PA.  Approximately 250 attendees (based on historical files) with a much greater focus on the different organizations within the Medical Research and Materiel Command.  5.  Can offerors at least count on the fact that federal employees who attend the conference will be reimbursed by their agencies for their travel, room and food expenses?  To bid on a fixed price basis, offerors need to know if the 400 person estimate is at least obtainable. All allowable government employee expenses will be reimbursed by their agencies. 6.  Question No. 24 (See Amendment 1)  You anticipate a fixed price contract, however, could other CLINs, for example ODCs, be proposed on a cost-basis, because of so many uncertainties in the RFP. Offerors may propose under a fixed price with reimbursable Other Direct Costs (ODCs).  This is a performance-based requirement; the Government is relying upon the offeror to structure the pr oposal utilizing their expertise in conference planning/mangement.  7.  In Question 1  (See Amendment 1), you state that the contractor is to propose the registration/exhibitor fee.  However, you also state that the government will exercise final decision authority.  Again, how can offerors propose a firm fixed price sin ce these fees have a direct bearing on a fixed price proposal. Offerors may propose under a fixed price with reimbursable Other Direct Costs (ODCs).  This is a performance-based requirement; the Government is relying upon the offeror to structure the proposal utilizing their expertise in conference planning/mangement. 8.  If we do subcontract, are there any limitations (and if so, how much) on the amount of work that can be performed by the subcontractor? As per clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance must be for employees of the prime contractor.
