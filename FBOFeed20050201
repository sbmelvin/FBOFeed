<ARCHDATE>04012005
<CONTACT>Donald King, 202-385-7776
<DESC>Washington, DC  - The U. S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced today it has selected a team headed by Lockheed Martin to provide services now offered by the agency's automated flight service stations.  The total evaluated cost of the five-year contract, with five additional option years, is $1.9 billion and represents estimated savings of $2.2 billion over the next ten years. The FAA selected Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland, for its demonstrated ability to deliver high-quality safety and service, technical excellence, competitive cost, and provide a seamless transition to new operations. Under continued FAA oversight, Lockheed Martin will operate flight service stations according to the agency's strict safety and service requirements. Approximately 2,500 FAA employees now provide services at 58 automated flight service stations in the contiguous 48 states, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Flight service specialists provide a variety of services, including weather briefings, inflight radio communications, flight planning and search-and-rescue support, primarily to private and non-airline commercial pilots.  These specialists do not separate or control aircraft.   Studies by the FAA and the Department of Transportation's Inspector General identified significant potential cost savings among automated flight service stations.  FAA spending on flight service operations totaled about $500 million in fiscal year 2003.  Of these total operating costs, only $60 million is offset by federal fuel taxes collected from general aviation.  Additionally, many automated flight service stations contain outmoded equipment, are in need of upgraded technology and are housed in deteriorating buildings. After completing a careful review, the FAA formally announced in December 2003 that its flight service stations met the criteria for competitive sourcing and that it would conduct a competition under the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-76 guidelines for an improved way to provide flight service operations.    The FAA evaluated five competing service providers, including the incumbent government organization, on the best value to the government for the delivery of effective services to support safe and efficient flight.  The FAA required each potential service provider to demonstrate savings of almost $1 billion over ten years.   Lockheed Martin will assume operations in October of this year.  Incremental consolidation of the 58 current flight service stations will begin in April 2006 and is expected to result in 20 sites at the end of March 2007.  More information on the results of the competition is at www.faa.gov/aca.

<DESC>NSN:  To be determined.
PN:   Multiple, see below list.
Nomenclatures:  Mixing Duct (PN:  1452M70G06), Spray Bar Damper Rings (PN: 2026M71P01), Segmented Flameholders (PN: 2026M64G04).

Item Description:  With funded airframe and avionics modifications, the F16C/D will continue to support Air Combat Command’s force structure through 2025.  The F110-GE-100 (F-16C/D Block 30/40) and F110-GE-129 (F-16C/D Block 50) engine weapon systems including augmenter/exhaust system are exceeding their original design life.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle section is a leading contributor of labor intensive, unscheduled engine removals directly related to excessively repaired parts subject to thermal variances.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle refurbishment, in conjunction with Service Life Extension Life (SLEP) and Aging Engine Upgrade (AEU) initiatives, is required to meet the funded, extended design life for the airframe.  This effort requires timely delivery of newly designed F100 hardware to support the refurbishment of the F110-GE-100 and –129 engine augmenters that will be refurbished on specific schedules at the  OC-ALC depot.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this solicitation.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  Please do not call this number for solicitation requests.

<DESC>Offshore Petroleum Discharge System(s) (OPDS) consisting of U.S.-flag self-sustaining vessel(s) and associated equipment for the deployment, operation, and redeployment of OPDS in support of the Defense Energy Support Center's Prepostioning Program.  This RFP replaces the DRAFT RFP N00033-04-R-3300 and can be found on the Military Sealift Command’s website (www.msc.navy.mil).  It is anticipated that the charter period will be 12-months firm with three 12-month options and one 11-month option.  As part of a preaward survey and prior to acceptance by the government, the Contractor will be required to demonstrate that their system meets all of the minimum technical capabilities, as well as any other operating capabilities, as described in the Contractor's proposal.  Based on today's technology, MSC considers Dynamic Positioning to be a realistic approach to the vessel requirement for maintaining a fixed position and deploying hose.  Considering the sea state (wind and current) parameters set up for deployment and operation, MSC is skeptical that mooring is an acceptable solution.  However, with proper justification and documentation MSC will consider alternate methods.  Your attention is drawn to Part I, Box 18, which asks that you provide the end of charter purchase price for the vessel(s) and hose system(Note: This option may be exercised at the Government's sole discretion) and that you provide any fees required, should the Government not exercise any option.

<DESC>This is published as a Sole Source announcement. The statutory authority that permits other than full and open competition for this requirement is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source modification to extend the San Diego Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) contract N00244-98-D-0065, for an additional 1 year period of performance, to SBC - Pacific Bell. The purpose of this contract extension is to continue uninterrupted, private Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) and data transport services for Navy and Marine Corps activities in the San Diego, CA metropolitan area and aboard Camp Pendleton, CA. This contract extension modification is for the period 01 April 2005 through 31 March 2006. SBC - Pacific Bell is currently the only provider capable of provi! ding uninterrupted service because the system currently in use (hardware, software, facilities and requisite technical expertise for providing and maintaining required services) is wholly owned, maintained, and secured by SBC - Pacific Bell in their Central Offices and outside plant infrastructure. Additionally: SBC - Pacific Bell retains the right to refuse other vendors access to their systems and cable plant; SBC - Pacific Bell is currently the only vendor with existing facilities at all eleven Navy bases served by the SDMAN; SBC - Pacific Bell is currently the only source of the 7 digit telephone numbers supporting the Navy's unique 5 digit dialing plan and; the abbreviated period of performance would prohibit any other contractor from recouping the costs required for capital    investment. Therefore, because of the aforementioned factors, SBC - Pacific Bell is the only contractor capable of providing the required services continuously and without interruption.    The NA! ICS code for this action is 517110.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, 
Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Port of Valparaiso Logistics Chain Improvement Project.  

Located in Chile's Region V, the Port of Valparaiso functions as the principal port for 70% of Chile's fruit exports, handles 20% of the country's general cargo, and 20% of the container traffic.  The Empresa Portuaria Valparaiso (EPV) has administered the port since January 1998.  EPV manages the public areas of the port, oversees the concessions to private operators, and is responsible for planning the port’s future development. 
In order to improve the flow of cargo, the Port of Valparaiso is planning a new Off-Port Logistics Zone (Zona Extraportuaria de Actividades Logísticas, ZEAL), where the port will re-locate customs and agricultural services and cargo preparation prior to cargo arriving at the terminals.  The ZEAL and related road projects will significantly impact the logistics chain of the Port of Valparaiso with regard to vehicle routing, land utilization and layout and logistics and transport infrastructure. The EPV needs to effectively integrate these new infrastructure projects and new security requirements into the process of upgrading its port community systems, which are computer networks that link the port with its users, including truckers, rail companies, shipping lines, feeder ports, shippers, customs agents and customs officers.  

The feasibility study will help the EPV improve the efficiency of the port’s logistics chain and integrate existing and planned electronic information systems.

The feasibility study tasks can be summarized as follows:

Task 1: 	Document Review
Task 2:  	Technical Evaluation 
		2.1 Current Port Operations
		2.2. ZEAL and other Off-Port Facilities
		2.3 Southern Access Road and Tunnels
		2.4 Integration Issues
Task 3: 	Equipment and Systems Needs Assessment
Task 4: 	Institutional and Regulatory Assessment
Task 5: 	Economic and Financial Analysis
Task 6:  	Initial Environment Assessment 
Task 7:		Recommendations and Preparation of Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $451,350 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 5:00 pm, March 17, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Surgery Branch (SB), Cell Production Facility (CPF) intends to procure on a sole-source basis for a large scale clinical grade cell separation apparatus  from Miltenyi Biotec Inc., 12740 Earhart Avenue, Auburn, CA 95602.  The SB/NCI has an ongoing clinical program using adoptive cell transfer therapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer.  The Cell Production Facility of the SB/NCI uses sophisticated immunological and cell biological methods to identify tumor reactive T lymphocytes from patients with cancer, and expand them to numbers in the tens of billions while retaining their anti-tumor function.  The improvement of cell transfer therapy and its wider application comprise a primary goal of the SB/NCI and they are currently recruiting patients for five clinical protocols investigating cell transfer therapies for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer. These protocols will examine the use of genetically altered lymphocytes, superior conditioning regimens, and concurrent vaccination with cell transfer therapy.  To investigate the specific cell populations responsible for causing tumor regression in treated patients, the SB/NCI intends to amend our clinical protocols to allow the enrichment of specific lymphocyte populations prior to cell infusion into patients. To achieve this enrichment it is necessary to obtain a system that meets the following specifications: 1) it must be capable of CD8 enrichment to greater than 95% purity; 2) it must be capable of CD25 depletion to less than 1% of cells; 3) the system must have capacity for cell numbers between 1 x 108 to 3 x 1011 cells; 4) the system must have reagents and protocols consistent with purification of cells under Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP);  5) the system must be “closed,” and fully automated and yield a sterile cell product; and 6) the supplier must have Master Files with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that can be cross-referenced for use of CD8 and CD25 reagents.  Miltenyi Biotec is the only source known to NCI researcher that has the aforementioned features.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on February 11, 2005.  Emailed and faxed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516; Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>***THIS MODIFIES THE PREVIOUS SYNOPSIS.  THE COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION FOR THIS 8(a) REQUIREMENT WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OR ABOUT MARCH 31, 2005.  PHONE CALLS AND E-MAILS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON THIS WEBSITE WHEN AVAILABLE. PAPER COPIES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.***This requirement is for miscellaneous construction support services for Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), primarily for minor new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, maintenance and repair work, typically for commercial office buildings but may also include some residential treatment facilities.  The government intends on awarding one, or more, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract(s) to eligible 8(a) firm(s) through a competitive source selection process.  The competition will be restricted to eligible 8 (a) firms currently maintaining a bona fide branch office in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Area (DC, VA, MD, WV).  A bona fide branch office is a place where an 8(a) participant regularly maintains a construction management office employing at least one full-time individual within the DC Metropolitan Area geographic boundary.  The successful 8(a) participant(s) will be selected using a best value approach, with past performance (in particular, demonstrated ability to meet performance schedules) being more important than price.  Price will be evaluated based on a real, or simulated, construction project.  (The government reserves the right to independently obtain past performance information after receipt of proposals.)

The task order-specific Scopes of Work for the non-commercial construction services under the IDIQ may be comprised of performance-based, design-build, or a combination thereof.  (Any design work will be incidental in comparison to the construction requirements for all projects.)  Individual task order requirements will be negotiated on a firm-fixed price basis using the R.S. Means “Square Foot Costs book” (for 2005) as the common negotiation tool.  Projects will occur in various physical spaces occupied by CSOSA throughout the District of Columbia.  Task Orders issued after award will consist of a broad range of minor new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, maintenance and repair work, primarily for commercial office buildings but may also include some residential treatment facilities.  Work will include tasks in a variety of trades such as carpentry, painting, installation services, plumbing, painting, masonry, welding, HVAC, electrical distribution, etc.  The contractor shall furnish all materials, labor, plant, tools, transportation, equipment, testing services insurance  and quality control and incidentals necessary to meet the task order-specific Scope of Work (SOW).  All work shall be performed in accordance with the technical standards of the basic IDIQ, and the task-order specific SOW.  The typical range of required construction services includes mechanical, electrical, and plumbing skills as well as experience with commercial painting and flooring treatments.  

The estimated period of performance shall be a base year, with four one-year option periods.  The anticipated dollar value is an estimated $250,000 for the base year and for each of the one-year option periods, with a total estimated contract value of $1,250,000.  This amount may be reduced if multiple (not more than two (2)) contracts are awarded.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the amount of work to be ordered, however, a minimum amount of $25,000 is guaranteed for each performance year, for each contract awarded.  The minimum guaranteed funding amount will be reduced by the issuance of task orders during the period of performance.  Individual task orders will typically range from $2,500 to $25,000.  Contract award(s) will not preclude CSOSA from acquiring construction services through other acquisition methods during the life of the contract(s).  The primary NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $28.5MIL.

It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 14 January  2005 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http:// www. eps. gov    The solicitation will contain the mandatory response time and submittal requirements.  Paper copies will not be made available.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon interested parties to review this web site frequently for any updates / amendments to any and all documents.  No telephone requests for this solicitation will be accepted.  Firms are reminded registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http:// www. ccr. gov is mandatory.

<DESC>MODIFICATION FOR CLARIFICATION:  This soliciation includes a two-year basic contract and three one-year options.  The government's BEQ is as follows:  PN1452M70G06:Basic--368 each, Option I--231 each , Option II--230 each , Option III--147 each...Total--976.  PN2026M64G04:  Basic--368 each, Option I--231 each, Option II--230 each, Option III--147...Total--976.  PN 2026M71P01:  Basic 368 each, Option I--231 each, Option II--230 each, Option III--147 each...Total--976 each.  All other terms remain unchanged.


NSN:  To be determined.
PN:   Multiple, see below list.
Nomenclatures:  Mixing Duct (PN:  1452M70G06), Spray Bar Damper Rings (PN: 2026M71P01), Segmented Flameholders (PN: 2026M64G04).  
	Note 1:  Additional PN 2026M64G06 quantities included in total flameholder estimate.  Flameholder will change from one piece to ten separate segments consisting of nine each PN 2026M64G04 and one each of 2026M64G06.

Item Description:  With funded airframe and avionics modifications, the F16C/D will continue to support Air Combat Command’s force structure through 2025.  The F110-GE-100 (F-16C/D Block 30/40) and F110-GE-129 (F-16C/D Block 50) engine weapon systems including augmenter/exhaust system are exceeding their original design life.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle section is a leading contributor of labor intensive, unscheduled engine removals directly related to excessively repaired parts subject to thermal variances.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle refurbishment, in conjunction with Service Life Extension Life (SLEP) and Aging Engine Upgrade (AEU) initiatives, is required to meet the funded, extended design life for the airframe.  This effort requires timely delivery of newly designed F100 hardware to support the refurbishment of the F110-GE-100 and –129 engine augmenters that will be refurbished on specific schedules at the  OC-ALC depot.

The one-on-one sessions will be scheduled after 10  February 2005, when the number of requests for one-on-one sessions have been  determined.    Correspondence may be sent by post to Mr. Dinwoody at the following address: James Dinwoody AFSAC/PKP 1822 Van Patton Dr. Bldg. 210 Front Wright Patterson, OH  45433-5337 NOTE: Our customers are concerned with maintaining visibility and accuracy of  shipped assets.   We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don+t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Order under NAVAIR Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-03-G-0004 for engineering services of autopilot update, integration, launch predictions and weapons manufacturer interface for the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) missile.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate this Order on a sole source basis with McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MCD), a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO 63166-0516.  MCD is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and supplier of the F/A-18 Weapon System, and only MDC has the F/A-18 peculiar engineering data, capability, resources and expertise required to perform NAVAIR’s requirements.  Therefore, MDC’s unique qualifications justify this sole source under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as sited in FAR Part 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  See Numbered Note 22.

These services include traditional analog telephony; cellular phones, pagers and converged devices such as wireless personal data assistants; calling cards; Voice over Internet Protocol; satellite teleports and leased data lines. GAO Report GAO-04-671 entitled VENDOR PAYMENTS:  Inadequate Management Oversight Hampers the Navy’s Ability to Effectively Manage Its Telecommunication Program of June 2004, highlighted deficiencies in our management of this function.  Consequently, The Department desires to improve its ability to manage these resources to save costs and ensure that the needed level of service is available to its personnel when and where it is necessary.  In pursuit of that goal the Department desires to implement an enterprise-wide telecommunications management system that will provi! de it with a holistic, comprehensive and integrated view of its non-secure telecommunications environment and the ability to effectively manage those resources. As an initial step in achieving that goal, it is necessary to establish a baseline of both current assets and current costs of the DON telecom function.   Request: This Request for Information is to determine the breadth and scope of capabilities, services, and products available to establish an enterprise inventory and expense baseline of telecommunication resources.  Responders are invited to identify applicable strategies, demonstrable solutions, and individual capabilities to include, but not limited to (1) web-based and other automated tools for telecommunication resources inventory and expense control management; (2) metrics, benchmarks and leading practices for management and control of telecommunication resources inventory; (3) scalability of tools used for inventory, billing, accounting and control, and capital planning applications; (4) contracting and business process models for acquiring and maintaining telecommunication inventories and expense baselines; (5) compensation models for developing and maintaining an enterprise inventory; and (6) notional pricing for developing and maintaining an enterprise inventory of telecomm! unication resources and expenses.     Submittals: Vendors having the skills and capabilities to address the above in whole or in part are invited to submit an information package.  Submissions shall be in electronic format using Microsoft® Word or Adobe ® PDF format.  Submissions are to be provided to Mr. Bill Huber, Contracting Officer, NAVICP, at william.huber@navy.mil.

<DESC>Department of the Navy Office of the Chief Information Officer Request for Information (RFI) Enterprise Telecommunications Management Systems (ETM) Introduction This is a sources sought synopsis for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal, award a contract or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition procedure it may choose to pursue, if any. Background The Department of the Navy (DON) utilizes a diverse group of telecommunications services from a number of vendors across the globe to provide its non-secure telecommunications needs.   These services include traditional analog telephony; cellular phones, pagers and converged devices such as wireless PDAs; calling cards; VoIP; satellite teleports and leased data lines.  GAO Report  GAO-04-671 entitled VENDOR PAYMENTS:  Inadequate Management Oversight Hampers the Navy’s Ability to Effectively Manage Its Telecommunication Program of June 2004 highlighted deficiencies in our management of this function.  Consequently, the Department desires to improve its ability to manage these resources to save costs and ensure that the needed level of service is available to its personnel when and where it is necessary.  In pursuit of that goal the Department desires to implement an enterprise-wide telecommunications management system that will provide it with a holistic, comprehensive and in! tegrated view of its non-secure telecommunications environment and the ability to effectively manage those resources.  Although convergence of traditional telecommunication services and data networks will be a feature of the DON ETM, our interest in this RFI is obtaining information on telecommunication management and technical qualifications.     Requirement The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support an RFP release for an enterprise-wide telecommunications management system in FY05, and to determine Industry interest in participating in this effort.  We seek to understand the current state of the art that companies have achieved in ETM systems as well as their anticipated future developments.  We are also interested in various alternative innovative and creative approaches to enterprise telecommunications management, and how these might apply to the Government’s effort to achieve this capability. Submittal Format Vendors having the skills and capabilities to meet the above requirement in whole or in part are invited to submit an information package addressing their ETM solution.  Each package shall not exceed 50 one-sided pages exclusive of graphical illustrations.  Submissions shall be in electronic format, in Microsoft® Word utilizing 12-point, Times New Roman font with minimum 1 inch margins or in Adobe ® PDF format adhering to the same guidelines.     No proprietary information is to be submitted at this time. Responses must be delivered via email by 5PM, 22 February, 2005 EDT to William.huber@navy.mil Administrative comments and questions regarding this RFI shall be directed to Bill Huber, Contract Specialist, at (717) 605-3210.  Programmatic and Technical comments and questions shall be directed to Mr. John Lussier, DoN CIO, john.lussier@navy.mil  (703) 604-7050 Submittal Content Details Submittals shall, at a minimum, address the following issues: Management Support  1.  Approach.  Discuss the overall approach to enterprise telecommunications management in an enterprise of the DON’s size and global reach.  Address in particular how your system will enable the Department to gain a comprehensive view of the diverse services provided by different vendors via various technologies in disparate locations and how that supports optimal management practices.   Specifically address how this approach dovetails with the Navy’s current investment in the non-Navy owned N/MCI Network. 2. Acquisition Strategies.  Describe any alternative acquisition strategies that have been, or may be, utilized in procuring your ETM system.   Address in particular in-house versus out-sourced strategies and their associated benefits, as well as system licensing versus purchase.     3. Management Information Systems.

<CONTACT>MARGARET EASTMAN CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487366     mrussell@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to enter into non-competitive negotiations with Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) of Redlands, CA to purchase a Department of the Interior (DOI)-wide Enterprise Licensing Agreement for the ArcGIS suite of software. The licensing agreement will be in accordance with the GSA SmartBuy program and agreement between GSA and ESRI executed in February 2004.  This licensing arrangement will provide for the unlimited use and maintenance of the ArcGIS software and limited quantities of other ESRI GIS software.  The support provided under the agreement will provide for the technical support of new and existing ESRI software, the authorization to duplicate and distribute ESRI software and upgrades, and the purchase of additional media kits.  In addition, the agreement will provide for limited access to ESRI through telephone user assistance through each identified site.  It is intended these services will support currently installed software acquired under the DOI-wide Blanket Purchase Agreement with ESRI or other contract vehicles for ESRI software and new purchases of ESRI software through their GSA schedule contract.  A contract vehicle with one base year and two option years commencing on October 1, 2005 is anticipated.  ESRI is the only source for technical support and authorization for the rights to duplicate and redistribute their proprietary products.  Firms which believe they can provide the above are invited to submit an affirmative response  by March 18, 2005.  An affirmative response shall include literature, brochures, and other such information which demonstrates the vendor's ability to provide the required Enterprise Licensing Agreement.  All responses will be considered.  This notice is for information purposes only.  A Request for Quote is not available.  This may represent the Government's only notice of this procurement.  Pending the Availability of Funds.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Department of Justice is developing an acquisition strategy for upgrading portions of various DoJ telephone systems and maintenance of existing legacy systems.  As part of this process, we are seeking information about small businesses that are capable of providing the services.  Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  There is no solicitation document available; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted via email in accordance with the instructions that follow.


The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys intends to: 1) purchase telecommunications equipment with follow on maintenance as required, and 2) maintain existing legacy systems. United States Attorneys’ Offices are located in nearly every city in the United States and in each U.S. Territory.  In approximately 260 of these locations, nearly every make and model telephone system manufactured in the past 12 to 15 years are installed and operational.  Some will be replaced over time, but offerors must assume the existing systems must be maintained over the life of the contract. Many of the existing  systems have exceeded their life cycle while others are obsolete due to several factors including manufactures no longer in business and no repair parts remain in the pipeline. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 517310, Telecommunications Resellers, with a size standard of 1500 employees.


The successful vendor must meet the following mandatory requirements at the time of an award, 1) A current Secret Level Security Clearances for all employees performing work at DOJ locations.  2) Because of the wide variety of legacy systems which must be maintained the vendor must hold certification in Telephone Systems manufactured by Executone and Mitel.   3)Demonstrated familiarity with Proxim Lynx and Tsunami Radios. 4) The vendors’s past performance will be a major factor in an evaluation..  This will be a Best Value approach to contract award.  


Responses to this announcement must provide detailed, concise information about: 1) the company’s qualifications and experience in providing the required telephone system hardware within the past three years. Project information shall include the contract number, dollar value, period of performance, current status, and current point of contact information such as name, address, telephone number, and email address.  2) the company’s qualifications, certifications and experience in maintaining legacy systems such as Mitel and Executone within the past three years. 3) Venders must demonstrate the capability to perform within the continental U.S and Territories. 4) Address the company security clearance level. .

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seek responses to a Request for Information (RFI) for the acquisition of a spacecraft in support of NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). BACKGROUND: The Space Technology 8 (ST8) subsystem technology validation mission, as a part of NASA’s continuing NMP being managed by JPL, will require the acquisition of a spacecraft, consisting of a spacecraft bus integrated with a JPL-supplied payload, and ground operations/system services. In an effort to ascertain the availability of providers capable of meeting the ST8 mission and flight system technical requirements, JPL will be issuing a Request for Information (RFI) and its accompanying Mission Concept document (Attachment A). NASA has competitively selected specific subsystem technology validation experiments to be the ST8 flight mission payload. The ST8 Project Office will be responsible for competitively procuring a spacecraft bus (carrier) to accommodate the NASA-selected technology experiments. Mission operations and ground system services will be procured under subcontract to the flight system provider, or separately, if the selected flight system provider is not in a position to offer these services.  Given the cost constraints of the NMP ST8 project, modification to an existing spacecraft bus design is the anticipated approach.  Although the ST8 mission represents the space flight validation of new technologies, this function will be entirely fulfilled through the technology experiment payloads. The carrier is not to incorporate new technologies. Some form of flight heritage or application of existing technologies will be required for all carrier components. The ST8 mission is presently targeted for launch on a Pegasus XL from Vandenberg AFB, CA, in December 2008. The mission requirements call for the flight system to be inserted into a sun synchronous elliptical orbit with an apogee above 1000 km altitude to provide significant radiation environment for one class of payload experiment. The overall mission duration is planned to be six (6) months after completion of on-orbit checkout of the flight system. RFI WEBSITE: The RFI will be posted on or before February 4, 2005 on JPL's NMP ST8 Carrier RFI website at:     http://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/RFP/GTO-ST8     Responses will be considered from U.S. providers only. JPL POINT OF CONTACT: Any inquiries associated with the above synopsis should be directed to the attention of Gerald T. O'Connell at either the email address of gerald.t.oconnell@jpl.nasa.gov or via a phone call to (818) 354-4885.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  Its purpose is to generate responses from qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, veteran owned, disabled veteran owned, or small business companies, which have the interest and ability to test the hypothesis that knowing the genotype of the metabolizing enzyme, CYP2C9, and using this knowledge to guide dosing will improve the time within the therapeutic range and reduce over-anticoagulation and the initial risk of bleeding complications of the anticoagulant medication, warfarin.  In order to prospectively determine if knowledge of CYP2C9 alleles improves the safety and efficacy of warfarin therapy and warrants genotyping of CYP2C9 when initiating anticoagulant therapy, this study will prospectively compare standard-of-care versus pharmacogenetics-guided warfarin treatment.   Companies responding to this synopsis must indicate whether they are interested in this project as a prime contractor or as a possible subcontractor.  Companies interested in this requirement as a subcontractor must indicate their areas of expertise that would support a prime contractor in the performance of the work described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  Contractors must submit a capability statement describing their company's experience and ability to conduct as the prime contractor or support as a subcontractor research to investigate the prospective predictive value of pharmacogenetics in determining the proper dose and safety of prescription drugs and sex differences in women and men.  A two and one half year contract is intended.  

The evaluation process of Offerors submitting capability statements as a prime contractor will determine whether Offerors are able to meet the following research requirements: (1) Study Subjects - Four hundred Caucasian male and female patients over 18 years who are undergoing the initiation of warfarin therapy and requiring a target INR value between 2 and 3 will be enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures.  History and physical examination will be conducted at screening to assure appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.  Patients will be genotyped for CYP2C9 prior to being enrolled in the study.  Given the frequency of the CYP2C9 variant enzymes is ~33% (individuals with at least one variant allele), to recruit 400 subjects (with at least one variant alleles), approximately 1200 subjects may need to be screened.  Patients with at least one CYP2C9 variant alleles (*2 or *3) will be recruited and randomly allocated to the control (standard-of-care, n=200) or pharmacogenetics-guided groups (n=200).  An additional blood sample will be collected to determine the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) genotype in post hoc analysis.  Patients' demographic characteristics will be recorded: sex, age, weight, height, and indication for warfarin therapy, additional medical problems, and concurrent medications.  If a subject is removed from the study for any reason(s), this shall be noted and the reason reported on a case report form.  Subjects shall be free to withdraw from the study at any time.  (2) Study Design - A randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel study will be conducted in patients with indication for the initiation of warfarin therapy.  Multiple clinical centers may participate provided each clinical center uses the same approach for dosing and frequency monitoring.  (3) Outcome Measures - The primary efficacy end point of this study will be the time within therapeutic range INR of 2-3 (TTR) and the primary safety end point will be the time to first above-range INR.  The above-range INRs are defined as measurements of 4.0 or greater.  The secondary end points are as follows: time to first INR in therapeutic range; time to stable warfarin dosing; number and timing of serious or life-threatening bleeding events; number of venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism events; mean warfarin daily doses during the induction and the maintenance periods; number of INR monitoring; number of warfarin dose adjustments; frequency of hemorrhage; bleeding events when INR is within therapeutic INR range; concentration of S-warfarin at steady state; and number and % of INR values above 3 or below 2.  Post hoc analysis of VKORC1 will be conducted to determine the effect of VKORC1 genotype on the primary and secondary outcome measures.  (4) Human Subjects Study Requirements - All research conducted, supported, or regulated by any US Government Agency is subject to certain uniform requirements of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects including IRB membership, IRB review and approval criteria, IRB operations and record keeping, and informed consent.  Research involving human subjects and funded by the Food and Drug Administration must receive approval from FDA's Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) prior to enrolling human subjects.  The criteria for the selection and screening of subjects including the inclusion and exclusion criteria shall be discussed in the proposal.  The Contractor shall understand and comply with ethical principles and regulatory requirements involving human subjects research as specified in the Federal regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects, 45 CFR 46.  The Contractor shall remain in compliance with the Health and Human Services (HHS) policies and procedures that concern the conduct of human subjects research.  The contractor shall work with the FDA Project Officer throughout the process of IRB approval to coordinate activities of both Human Subjects Protection Committees.  (5) Analytical Methods - Analytical methods shall accurately determine all relevant variables needed to conduct the study including geneotype of 2C19, warfarin and metabolite(s) concentrations in the blood, INR and plasma levels of vitamin K and VKORC1.  Validation information to adequately address the (a) accuracy, (b) precision, (c) selectivity, (d) sensitivity, (e) reproducibility and (f) stability of the method shall be referenced.   See Guidance for Industry - Bioanalytical Method Validation at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm for method validation specifics.  (6) Data Analysis and Interpretation - Statistical methods to test the hypothesis that genotyping improves TTR  by 20% or reduces the hazard ratio to 1/2 in time to first above INR (INR greater or equal 4) in patients with at least one CYP2C9 variant allele shall be described.  Statistical methods for analyzing all relevant variables including age, sex, ethnic factors, diet (Vitamin K intake), drug and herbal interactions, co-morbid disease, social influences (smoking, alcohol), changes in vitamin K or warfarin absorption (e.g., GI factors or drug effects), changes in warfarin metabolism (e.g., liver disease or drug effects), changes in Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis or metabolism (e.g., liver disease, drug effects, or other medical conditions), other effects of undisclosed concomitant drug use, or patient compliance issue shall be described.  (7) Safety Assessments - All adverse events shall be recorded and reported according to the applicable regulations (see 21 CFR 310.305, 21 CFR 312.32, 21 CFR 314.50, 21CFR 314.80, 21 CFR 314.81, 21 CFR 314.98, 21CFR 600.80, 21 CFR 600.81, 21 CFR 601.28).  Descriptions of adverse events shall provide information that will allow for interpretation of the event, including, but not limited to: dose and duration of therapy, outcome of the event, including treatment if any, whether blood concentrations of the drug were within sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, or toxic ranges, physiological characteristics of the subject (stage of pregnancy, age, underlying medical condition, etc.), and presence of possible confounders (polytherapy, other drugs, etc.) 

The evaluation process of Offerors submitting capability statements as a subcontractor will consist of a subjective assessment of the Offeror's expertise and experience in supporting any portion of the work described above.

Interested Offerors shall provide (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (3) any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance FDA's consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate with Archimage Associates, 4200 Montrose Boulevard, Houston, Texas, to adapt a self-administered, automated 24 hour recall utilized for children for use in adults.  The purpose of this procurement is to create a self-administered automated multiple pass 24-hour dietary recall that could be administered both on the internet or a personal computer (PC). Under 41 USC 253(e)(1) and FAR citation 6.302-1, Archimage Associates is the only source with the pre-requisite experience in this area to complete the  procurement based on existing automated self-automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall for children.  The reason for a justification for other than full and open competition is due to inherent duplication of costs to the government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible.  The ultimate goal is to create software for an attractive and easy to use self-administered, automated 24-hour recall and to make this software available on a public website, so that investigators could easily use the system at minimal or no cost in the future. 

All organizations responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to design 24-hour dietary recall software in a self-administered PC or web environment that adheres to the passes, probes, and database of the current state-of-the-art interviewer-administered Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) 24-hour recall methodology developed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).  This requires that the software be designed to guide respondents through the following five passes: quick list, forgotten food list, time and occasion, food detail, and review.  These passes require multi-level food probes to accurately assess food types and amounts, and function as multiple reminders to trigger respondents’ memories of food consumed the previous day.  In addition, the software must attractive and accessible to low literacy groups through the use of audio voice technology and must meet government guidelines for web use accessibility.

Information furnished must not exceed 10 pages and should include an outline of previous similar projects and relevant literature shall be identified to assist the NIH in performing a proper evaluation of your capability statement.  Responses may be submitted electronically to Jacque Ballard, Contracting Officer at ballardj@mail.nih.gov  in either WordPerfect or Microsoft Word or faxed to (301) 402 8579 by March 17, 2005 2:00 PM EST.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for Performance Enhancement and Project Team Readiness services, processes and activities in support of the Academy of Program and Project Leadership (APPL).	 The purpose of this requirement is to provide NASA project teams with technical, assessment, mentoring and coaching services, and training workshops to increase member and team readiness.  As a result, NASA project teams can increase their performance capability and proactively diagnose and address technical, behavioral, or attitudinal challenges to ensure project success.  Potential sources are sought capable of conducting Performance Enhancement and Project Team Readiness services in the following areas: 1. Assessment and Coaching:  Conduct e-assessments of project team effectiveness / interfaces and provide related coaching using web-based systems.   2. Mentoring and Consulting:  Includes coordinating a cadre of experienced or expert Project Management Mentors (PMM), practitioners (“EPs”), and subject matter experts (SME’s) available on short notice to provide just-in-time support to NASA.   3. Program Development and Consultation: Support the Academy of Program and Project Leadership to integrate current program / project activities and processes into a “One-NASA” approach across the agency.	The project integration processes shall be in accordance with NASA policy. 4. Project Workshops:  Hold workshops to address and improve project teams.  Typically, these workshops are based on information that is identified in effectiveness assessments or through dialogues with the team.   5. “MOWG" (Management Operations Working Group) Support:  Provide the Academy of Program and Project Leadership with guidance from the MOWG.  (The MOWG is a group containing many of NASA's most respected Project Managers (PM’s).) 6. Center Program Managers/Representatives:  Brief and coordinate with senior management; arrange for project assessments, consultation, workshops and knowledge tool loads; regularly visit each project to offer effective interventions and to keep Project Managers informed on the development of project team readiness. 7. Process Development:  Benchmark and enhance project processes at NASA Centers; publish information on best or emerging practices; assist Centers in implementing new or improved processes. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Center in determining whether a Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement. If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals. All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 611430, and the size standard under this code is $6M (Not to Exceed). Furthermore, the Government is also considering whether to procure the required Performance Enhancement and Project Team Readiness services through the solicitation and award of Multiple-Award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) issued against GSA schedule contracts.  Firms having the required specialized capabilities in part or in all of the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 5 pages or less documenting their ability and past experience in performing similar efforts as described above.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided for requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources for the development of nuclear radiation detectors that principally use a solid material as the detection medium for both gamma and neutron radiation.  It is essential that the detection medium be scalable in size from man-portable sizes to tens of square meters and that it be formable into configurations other than those offered by conventional crystalline and gaseous media.  The most desirable detection medium shall also be flexible with a minimum degradation in performance when bent or twisted.  Systems from this detector family must provide data through standard network and communications protocols in a format that is usable by a non-technical but trained operator.  Systems must also be usable in a wide variety of operating environments.  Large system size configurations must not be susceptible to single point destruction (i.e., destruction of a small portion of a panel must not render the entire panel or system inoperative).

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas.  Responses are to be limited to no more than five pages.  Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, CAGE code, DUNS Number, business size, and small business classification (8(a), HUBZone, etc.), if applicable.  Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.   

Responses shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm EST on 16 February 2005.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged, and shall be submitted to Ms. Elizabeth Braxton at nrdetect@dtra.mil.  Non-electronic responses, though not preferred, may be submitted via facsimile to 703.325.9294 to the attention of Ms. Elizabeth Braxton.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  

Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910.  THERE IS NO SOLICIATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought is in support of market research being conducted by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to identify capable potential sources interested in providing services for the "2006 Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey".  

NHTSA is seeking sources to provide services for the NHTSA Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey (MVOSS). This project will implement the sixth MVOSS, with data collection to begin at the onset of calendar year 2006.  The 2006 MVOSS will require 12,000 interviews, averaging about 20 minutes apiece, completed during a two-to-three month period (with extensive amounts of callback and refusal conversion activities conducted over that time period).

<DESC>The Defense Finance and Accounting Service is conducting market research to identify vendors capable of providing a web-based analytic metrics capture/presentation/display solution for DFAS. The requirement is as follows:  

DFAS Analytic Metrics capture/Definition/Presentation/Display Capability is defined as the means to leverage a single software application or module – or integrated suite (two or more) of software applications and/or modules – to provide a web-based, analytic metrics capture/definition/presentation/display solution for DFAS.

Minimum Functional/Technical Requirements

Metric Data Collection/Input: 
&#61623; Single point, direct manual entry or flat-file extraction/importation of metric data from an existing database or database options to the application/module.  This must be user-friendly.
&#61623; Color-based or symbol-based error alert/indicator – if data entry is not made as planned (i.e., data missing, due date missed) – requiring corrective action.  Include MS Outlook (email) generated reminder to the business line point of contact (POC).  Also, a pop-up or similar feature which allows the POC to provide instructional information to feeder sites when the latter log-on to the application.
&#61623; Access/change-control and “lock out” for designated users, frameworks and data types – to prevent unauthorized data manipulation, especially of historical data – and, an audit trail.  These must be easy to set up and administer.  Include a super-user access level for the business line POC to allow validation of business line data from feeder sites without having to log out/log in for each site. 
&#61623; Varied formats – text (clear-text or yes/no) and/or numeric (positive or negative; whole number or decimal) – that can be used to pre-define valid data entries and associated parameters, thresholds, and/or tolerance levels.
&#61623; Expanded text/numeric data fields, in limited instances (e.g., 500 characters for data definitions or commentary; 14 positive digits and 3 decimal).
&#61623; Required commentary for anomalistic, changed or out-of-tolerance data inputs, calculations or ratings – or for as desired explanations/rationale.  Include MS Outlook (email) generated notice to users when a proposed and/or approved change is posted thereby enabling a current view of the data.
&#61623; Default/exception-based, user-specific data entry such that data fields a user is not required to update can be set to not expect/require any (or zero-based) data entry. 
&#61623; Period constraints – to restrict data entry to values for a specific period (e.g., a month, a quarter).  

Metric Data Array/Calculation: 
&#61623; Linking, sorting and tailoring of data for user-defined distinct/multiple frameworks (e.g., President’s Management Agenda, Balanced Scorecard(s) for various organizational levels, OSD Metrics – and strategic goals/targets or actual/index (tolerance) values which may be unique to (a) specific organizational level(s)).  
&#61623; Setting of pre-defined, pre-established defaults (including definitions and formulas) for each framework at user-defined organizational levels (including clients and customers). 
&#61623; Automatic cascading of “linked” data – to avoid duplicate entry.
&#61623; Performance rating(s) indicator(s) calculated – and color-coded – from either positive or negative numbers or text-based entries; rating(s) to be a combination of the color and the calculated result.  This rating/text must be posted to the appropriate presentation/display summary.  This is interrelated with the presentation/display summary requirement (first entry) under Data Presentation.
&#61623; Change tracking/audit trail summary that records such activity for a stated period (e.g., the past month).  This is interrelated with the data entry requirement for access/change control/audit trail.
&#61623; Exception-based calculations such that data fields a user is not required to update for a specific period – or at all – are exempted from calculations for that period.
&#61623; Exportation to other applications (e.g., Excel, Access, SQL).  This must be user-friendly and easy to complete. 
&#61623; Linkage to/archive capability for historical data retained by DFAS in an Oracle database.

Metric Data Presentation/Display:
&#61623; Varied user-defined (at desktop) and system administrator-defined (by default) presentation/display summaries (including, but not limited to, a briefing book metaphor for executive users (critical), charts, graphs, maps, scorecards, dashboards in canned/standardized (common) or customized formats) for a broad range of statistical (analytical) methods.  The user or systems administrator must easily achieve customization, to include displaying multiple metrics on a single presentation/display summary.  The latter may be needed to test/prototype a format before it is recommended/approved as a canned format.
&#61623; Restricted, interactive, web-based access, viewing (including trend comparisons and alternative formats), data change, and review/approval for the presentation/display summaries.  A home page gadget or desktop icon is an acceptable solution. 
&#61623; Robust user drill-down capability within each presentation/display summary that addresses the framework and organizational levels it represents.   
&#61623; Text sections within the varied presentation/display summaries for providing commentary, explanations, rationale for anomalistic, changed or out-of-tolerance data inputs, calculations or ratings.  This is interrelated with the expanded data field requirement under Data Entry.
&#61623; Comparison of current period and prior period data.  The prior period is often the prior (rolling) 12-13 months or the prior fiscal year, although it may be the prior month or quarter. 
&#61623; Access to historical data for trend analysis.  This is interrelated with the prior requirement and the linkage requirement under Data Array. 
&#61623; Allow for ‘what if’ scenario development and results while viewing a presentation/display summary, including a save (for future reuse without a need to recreate) or delete (for discard) option.
&#61623; Color-based or symbol-based indicator/alert to note improvement or decline from a previous period’s data – or when prior data may not be directly comparable due to changes in definition, formulas, etc.  
&#61623; Section 508 compliance.

Environment: 
&#61623; Compatible with DoD’s/DFAS’ Microsoft Office/Windows NT-based technology.
&#61623; Presentable via a Plumtree-based ePortal.

Funding (Cost): 
&#61623; Within DoD’s/DFAS’ non-capital (<$250,000) threshold. The $250,000 is inclusive of:
&#61623; The software license and software installation.
&#61623; Orientation training.  (See Training/Implementation Support)
&#61623; Troubleshooting, helpdesk support and maintenance during the first year. (See Technical Support)
&#61623; Exclusive of DoD’s/DFAS’ financial management business intelligence solution.

Linkages: Compatible with DFAS’ Oracle database-based historical data repository. 

Systems Administration:
&#61623; A non-Information Technology (IT) trained/skilled user should not be needed to perform this function.
&#61623; Self-sustaining, vendor-independent on-going technical support, except as noted in the requirements under Technical Support.  The goal is in-house maintenance unless unique circumstances dictate a need for vendor assistance, to include the introduction of application/module new releases/upgrades.

Technical Support:
&#61623; On-line help icon that leads to a concise, context-driven help menu – inclusive of context-related drop-down options.
&#61623; Application/module-specific 24-hour/7-day help desk staffed by subject matter experts for the specific application/module.
&#61623; Emergency, on-call/on-site 24-hour/7-day expert assistance for the specific application/module.
&#61623; Access to and use of one of the prior requirements if the application’s/module’s new release or upgrade proves beyond or outside of the in-house system administrator’s technical capabilities.
&#61623; On-line, web-based initial or refresher training at any time.




Training/Implementation Support – within 4-6 weeks of purchase at DFAS-named sites:
&#61623; 2-days planning/system administrator training; 1-day follow-up training (as needed, at a later date).
&#61623; 2-days to build/populate the application(s)/module(s). 
&#61623; 2- days user training - for up to 100 full access and 100 read-only end-users; each session to be a ½ day (3-4 hours) (i.e., same session conducted 4 times); 1-day follow-up training (as needed, at a later date).  This may include train-the-trainer sessions.
Vendors are requested to submit 1. Cover Letter to include the company name, date of submittal, POC and any applicable GSA FSS schedule contracts or other existing Federal Government contract vehicles.  2. A capability statement that addresses the contractor’s ability to meet the requirement. Responses to the RFI must be submitted via email to sandra.kleinknecht@dfas.mil by no later than 8AM Feb 7, 2005. No questions will be accepted by phone. This is not a request for proposal/quote and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by DFAS to contract for services. The use of the information submitted to DFAS as a result of this RFI will be at the discretion of the DFAS, and DFAS will not provide comments to any vendor’s submission

<DESC>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is a Sources Sought Notice issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to determine whether there are qualified sources that will be able to meet the requirements, as well as to allow industry an opportunity to provide comments concerning this requirement.  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  The Government will not pay for any comments received in response to this RFI and the Government makes no assertion that a formal solicitation will subsequently be released.

The U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) currently processes approximately 5 million applications and petitions and receives over $1 billion in fees each year.  The USCIS invites your comments in developing the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for comprehensive, onsite and offsite data entry, financial, and records management services, at four geographically dispersed USCIS Service Centers, in a manner that will ensure efficient and effective adjudication, financial responsibility, and excellent customer service.  The government anticipates using NAICS Code 561499 – All Other Business Support Services with a size standard of $6.0M.
	
The contract type has not yet been determined; however, the Government is contemplating awarding multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contracts with fixed price task orders.  USCIS is using a performance-based approach because it is looking for innovation and new ideas in the performance of these services.  You are invited to comment on the Government’s proposed approach, percent of error rates inherent in this type of work, especially areas where performance incentives could be expected to enhance performance.  You are also invited to address types of incentives/disincentives that may be most effective and the contract type that might lead to the greatest efficiency.  Although partnering arrangements are encouraged, special notice is given that small businesses will be subject to FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting which requires at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel to be expended for employees of the concern.  

	It is also important to note that USCIS anticipates that data entry and fee receipting and depositing will transition to a lockbox operation over the next five years.  Data entry and fee receipting and depositing comprise approximately 40 percent of the overall task requirements.  Accordingly, the USCIS anticipates, on an annual basis, that approximately 20 percent of data entry and fee receipting/deposits will transition to lockbox operations.  
     
	Additionally, please provide responses to the following:

1.	Please describe how the tasks and requirements of this performance work statement compare to your normal commercial practices.

2.	Please provide recommendations for performance-based payment mechanisms that might be used for records management services, if any.

3.	Please provide information on the way you price the types of services identified in the Draft Performance Work Statement (flat rates, hourly rates, fixed unit rates, etc) for your commercial customers.

4.	If you believe that any of the Government’s requirements are unique, or significantly different from the services you provide to your commercial customers, please provide suggestions as to the best way to price those services that are different than those you customarily provide commercially.  

5.	Please comments on what you feel are the distinguishing factors that the Government should use to best evaluate firms providing record management services.

6.	Please identify any applicable industry standards that you are aware of, that the Government should use to evaluate performance of record management services

7.	Please describe any conflicts or impediments you see arising from this performance work statement.

8.	Please provide recommendations on how to conduct an audit of a large-scale Fileroom operation without interrupting operations.  Also, advise how often an audit should be conducted.

9.	For this type of work, what are the actual percentages and dollars in subcontracting to small business and all sub-categories (small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?

10.	Do you have any suggestions on the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan?

11.	For task orders issued against the IDIQ contract: 

·	Keeping in mind that a multiple award contract is a means to promote competition during the life of the contract, what type of criteria should the Government use as a baseline to make this determination?
     
Beginning February 1, 2005 through March 1, 2005, USCIS cordially invites comments on this document.  To obtain copies of Attachment 4 Workload Data, contact the POCs listed below.  Please include estimated pricing, your capability statements, suggested solutions or improvements to the draft.  Do not write proprietary, sensitive or copy-write on your documents.  Documents shall not be returned to industry.  Please limit your responses to the questions above to not more than 10 single-sided pages.  Comments on the draft are unlimited.  Each submission should include one electronic (virus scanned) copy sent via e-mail to ava.morgan@dhs.gov and bertha.Johnson@dhs.gov.  

The information provided is informational only and its accuracy cannot be relied upon for bidding purposes.  All businesses capable of providing these services are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDEC-ARDEC is seeking to identify potential sources for a high- RPM fuze spin stand. Suggestions are welcomed regarding the requirements below  and if you feel an on-site visit is necessary due to size of equipment,  electrical requirements, or other considerations please make these comments  known. Specific requirements for the high-RPM spin stand will be identified in the  scope of work for this equipment.  The basic requirements are as follows: 1.Spin stand shall be capable of providing up to 100,000 RPM for small caliber  test specimens (i.e., fuzes for 25mm, etc.).  Also, shall be capable of  providing up to 30,000 RPM for larger caliber (i.e., artillery – approx. 2.5  lbs. Fuze weight).  Two separate spindles may be used to meet these  requirements. 2.Spinning elements shall be mechanically shielded to provide for operator  safety.  All removable shields shall include interlocks to preclude operation  when not in place. 3.Spindle(s) shall be designed to provide relatively easy installation &  removal of test units. 4.Provision shall be included to provide multiple electrical connections from  test specimen to outside instrumentation. 5.Spin stand shall be capable of reaching desired RPM rate “rapidly”.   Understanding that it is impossible for a mechanical system to match the  acceleration provided in a ballistic environment, this requirement will have  some degree of flexibility to compensate for physical limitations. 6.Optional requirements (to be priced separately) – 1) Optical instrumentation  and 2) Strobe (high-speed video to view test item) and other suggested optional  features. In addition, the Contractor shall provide on-site installation and setup of  machine, initial testing at Picatinny, detailed operating instructions shall be  provided, and one or two days’ worth of training for Fuze Division personnel. The above are merely basic requirements and should in no way limit the scope of  submissions to this office.  Commercially available items that are mass  producible and lend themselves to automation are preferred.  Submissions should include, but not be limited to:  A brief cost estimate for  purchase of the item as well as any other auxiliary costs, e.g., shipping,  training,set-up,etc. Interested parties should also include a brief summary of the company’s  capabilities, i.e.; description of facilities, personnel, past production  experience and environmental compliance as it relates to the product.  Please include whether item could be purchased under a GSA contract (include a  contract #). Interested firms should provide the manufacturer’s name, address of production  facility,  and administrative building, point-of-contact with telephone number  and e-mail address for each location, and size of business (small/large).  All interested sources must submit details of their capabilities no later than  21 (twenty one) days from date of publication to U.S. Army RDEC-ARDEC, ATTN: C.  Scott Lyon (and P. Sinha), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.  Responses can  also be submitted by email to clyon@pica.army.mil and psinha@pica.army.mil.   Large files need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com). This  market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not  constitute a solicitation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the  Government to issue a solicitation. All information submitted that is Company  Proprietary should be marked to identify that content and will be held in an  appropriate status.  Information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to  the Government. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the  results of this survey.

Small high-technology firms and research institutions are encouraged to jointly submit proposals to DoD for high quality cooperative research and development to solve the defense-related scientific or engineering problems set forth in the solicitation, especially those concepts that also have high potential for commercialization in the private sector.  STTR solicitation 2005 was publicly released on the DoD SBIR/STTR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Feb 1, 2005.   The 2005 STTR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Mar 15, 2005 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, April 15, 2005.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal.  Six DoD components will participate in the 2005 solicitation – the Department of the Army; the Department of the Air Force; the Department of the Navy; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the STTR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms and research institutions apply first for a phase I award of not to exceed $100,000 and one year, to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a phase II award not to exceed $750,000 for up to 24 months, to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR/STTR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD STTR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms."

Statement of Work 

Title of Project
Portable Electroanalysis for Monitoring Workplace Exposures to Beryllium

Period of Performance
Two years (from award of contract; beginning 2005)

Introduction

	Occupational exposure to beryllium can cause insidious disease that can be fatal, and new exposure limits for beryllium in air and on surfaces have been established in efforts to reduce exposure risks to potentially affected workers. Advances in sampling and analytical methods for beryllium are needed in order to meet the challenges relating to exposure assessment and risk reduction.

	Accurate knowledge of the characteristics and concentration of beryllium in workplace air and on workplace surfaces is crucial for assessing and ensuring the protection of workers from beryllium sensitization and chronic beryllium disease.  Portable techniques are needed to accurately, reliably, and cost-effectively obtain this knowledge in a timely way.  Electrochemical stripping methods exemplify the most promising electroanalytical techniques for the determination of trace concentrations of beryllium in various environmental media.  About a dozen years ago, adsorptive stripping voltammetry and potentiometry were shown to be effective for the trace measurement of beryllium in aqueous samples. 

	When coupled with an appropriate electrode material, electroanalytical techniques such as voltammetric and potentiometric stripping generally provide low detection limits with good response time and precision, and require instrumentation of low cost and low maintenance. The instrumentation/analysis method can be field deployable and requires low power, with no need for cooling or ventilation. However, several challenges limit the use of stripping voltammetric and potentionmetric methods in the field:  (1) sample preparation procedures that are easy to implement need to be developed for extracting beryllium from various environmental media (notably BeO) on-site in the field; (2) sample treatment procedures that can be easily carried out by non-chemists need to be developed for beryllium in air and in surface dust samples, and (3) the sensitivity of the electroanalytical method needs to be increased to enable quantitation of sub-ppb levels of beryllium. 

	This contract will seek to extend the application of the beryllium electroanalysis method for aqueous samples to sample media of concern in the occupational environment. 


Background

	Considering beryllium measurements in workplace samples, there are several significant challenges to overcome.  First is the need for on-site extraction techniques that are effective at dissolving beryllium from difficult refractory matrices.  Recent efforts at Los Alamos National Laboratory  and elsewhere have shown that dilute solutions of ammonium bifluoride can result in high recoveries of beryllium from many media, including difficult matrices such as beryllium oxide.  While there are limitations to this extraction technique (i.e., treatment of high-fired BeO with dilute ammonium bifluoride can give recoveries significantly less than 100%), no realistic alternatives for a field-portable method have yet been found.  With this in mind, it remains to develop a methodology which will allow for electroanalysis of Be subsequent to its extraction from aerosol samples and surface dust samples collected onto air filters and wipes, respectively.  Ultrasonic extraction  is a viable candidate technique that could offer the energy necessary to effect dissolution of beryllium from media collected onto air filter and surface dust wipe samples.  Other studies have investigated sequential extraction methods for measuring beryllium compounds of various solubilities,  and this research may offer guidance for future work on field extraction techniques for beryllium.

	Regarding the electroanalysis of Be, Wang and Tian1 showed that the thorin-beryllium complex can be measured with high sensitivity using adsorptive stripping voltammetry and potentiometry on mercury electrodes.  Other beryllium complexes can be investigated in order to increase sensitivity and selectivity.  Knowledge of beryllium ligand exchange reaction mechanisms  may lead to the investigation of other beryllium complexes as candidates for electroanalytical stripping measurements.  Also, various electroanalytical waveforms can be tried to optimize analytical figures of merit.  It is planned that experimental variables will be optimized so that a rugged, highly selective and sensitive method for the measurement beryllium in sample extracts will result.

	Recent work on anodic stripping voltammetry of cadmium and lead has shown that bismuth electrodes may offer similar or even superior performance to Hg electrodes.   The use of Bi rather than Hg offers advantages in terms of ruggedness and disposability during field use.  Also, screen-printed electrodes are extremely useful for field-portable, on-site electroanalysis.   Bismuth screen-printed electrodes have been successfully fabricated and their utility for electroanalysis has been demonstrated.   


Objective

Development of a Portable Electroanalysis Method for Monitoring Workplace Exposures to Beryllium

	The objective of this work will be to develop and evaluate a field-portable electroanalytical method for the determination of trace beryllium in the workplace.  Media of interest include air filter samples and surface wipe samples.  As a performance goal, it is desired that the portable beryllium method will meet NIOSH criteria for method accuracy, as elucidated by Kennedy et al. 

	As part of this contract, further investigations of candidate field-based extraction techniques for beryllium will be undertaken, and performance investigated in terms of recoveries as compared to reference beryllium concentrations.  Be extraction studies will also be carried out at CDC/NIOSH in collaboration with the contract recipient and the Beryllium Health and Safety Committee, Analytical Subcommittee.

	Electroanalysis studies on Be will be carried out principally in the contracted laboratory.  Coordination of investigations carried out at the contracted laboratory will be conducted by the NIOSH project officer at CDC/NIOSH/DART.  As standards development is an ultimate goal of this effort, the use of pertinent international standards (e.g., ASTM, ISO) should be considered when choosing appropriate sampling media and testing new methods using applicable measurement performance guidelines.  

	In combination with adsorptive stripping electrochemical analysis it is planned that, besides mercury electrodes, bismuth screen-printed electrodes will be investigated for their utility in measuring beryllium in workplace sample extracts.  Sample matrices of interest include air filter samples, wipe samples, and vacuum samples.  If necessary, other modified screen-printed electrodes will be used in order to enhance the selectivity of the electroanalytical measurement for beryllium; such studies may be required in view of possible matrix effects arising from the sampling media.  It is also stressed that the investigations will be performed using hand-carried, battery-powered electroanalytical instruments that have been fabricated and commercialized by several groups.


Scope of Work

	The scope of the project entails the development of a field-portable electroanalytical method for beryllium in workplace samples and involves the following aspects: 

1.	Development, characterization, and optimization of an electroanalytical method for measuring trace beryllium in workplace air filter and surface wipe samples.  The method for beryllium should involve the use of screen-printed electrodes and hand-portable, battery-powered electrochemical analyzers.
2.	In order to evaluate the best candidates for electroanalytical methods for measurement of trace beryllium, experiments will be carried out using stripping voltammetry and potentiometry.  Contractor experience in these areas of investigation is crucial for maximum probability of success of the project.
3.	Characterization parameters will include: (a) calibration data with standard deviations (n>3) for each concentration level (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 times the action level of interest for each matrix); (b) target recoveries of Be in the presence of interfering metals (e.g., Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Fe, Pb, Zn) of 100% ± 10% from media spikes; and (c) target Be recoveries of 100% ± 15% from air filter and surface wipe samples (some of these samples will be provided to the contractor by CDC/NIOSH); (c) estimation of limits of detection and limits of quantitation of the electroanalytical methods investigated.
4.	Media to be tested will include air filter media satisfying the guidelines of ISO 15202-1  and wipe sampling media satisfying the guidelines of ASTM D6966. 
5.	To maximize the ability to use the method on-site in the field, the electroanalytical method must be able to be performed on samples extracted with dilute (e.g., 1%) ammonium bifluoride solution or other appropriate extraction solvent.  Hence it will be necessary to demonstrate compatibility of the electroanalytical method with the extraction solution. Extraction volumes should be 5 mL or less, using mechanical or ultrasonic extraction techniques.
6.	Early and regular communication of problems encountered and proposed solutions to be implemented, with concurrence of the project officer.
7.	On-site field studies will be carried out, if possible, once laboratory evaluations are completed.  If done, field studies will be coordinated in consultation with the project officer.

Examples of sample media to be tested are air filters and surface wipes, which are used widely in the occupational hygiene arena.  The contractor shall submit a combined Work Plan / Quality Assurance Plan (WP/QAPP) for the project officer’s approval prior to beginning experiments.  In addition, the contractor will be required to:

-	run triplicate (minimum) analyses of all samples; i.e., each sample concentration tested for each technique investigated shall be prepared in triplicate (at a minimum) for each sample medium tested.
-	apply standard statistical parameters (standard deviation, coefficient of variation, relative standard deviation, mean, least squares regression analysis)
-	provide standard curves (with triplicate points minimum) for beryllium
-	provide interference data for at least two concentrations of each of the 12 previously mentioned potential interferences.  For these interference studies the beryllium concentrations tested should be within 0.5× – 2× the action level(s) of concern, and a minimum of three difference beryllium concentrations should be tested.
-	provide sample spike calibration curves for each matrix type

It is expected that the detection limit for the method will be no more than 0.1 times the action level of interest (~0.2 µg Be).   The method performance will be evaluated in consideration of CDC/NIOSH guidelines for accuracy.5


Proposed Timeline (24 months) &#61482;

	Contract awarded (begin timeline)

	Beryllium extraction studies (6 months)

Investigation / optimization of electrolyte compatibility with extraction solutions (6 months)

Beryllium complexation chemistry for adsorptive stripping measurements (9 months)

Electroanalysis of beryllium by portable stripping voltammetry and potentiometry (9 months)

Electroanalysis of beryllium using screen-printed electrodes (9 months)

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to purchase all labor, material and equipment necessary to extract, identify and produce quantities of proprietery terpene compounds (naturally occurring hydocarbons containing 15 carbon atoms and monoterpenes) from natural product and synthetic sources to be tested by CDC/NCID/DVBID, Fort Collins, CO, for repellency and biocidal activity against arthropods and other pests of public health importance from Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR  97331.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors providing the requested product. Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror=s best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 611310 and the Size Standard is 6,000,000 dollars for this requirement. This requirement is a not small business set-aside.  Interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the products in this synopsis should submit two (2) copies of a quotation to the below address. The quotation shall include the itemized price, prompt payment terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), Taxpayer Identification Number (TNN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNs), and descriptive literature of the product quoted. The quotation must reference  Solicitation number 2005-Q-01790.

Email quotations will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative to: dreedpenix@cdc.gov. Oregon State University., is the only source known to the government that can provide the services as outlined above. The source of the 5 identified proprietary C15 terpenes that CDC wishes to evaluate for repellency and biocidal activity is from the laboratory of Dr. Joe Karchesy, Associate Professor, Oregon State University, Department of Forest Products.  These 5 compounds have been previously isolated and identified by Dr. Karchesy’s laboratory.  Dr. Karchesy has unique knowledge of which C15 terpenes are most active against arthropods and he has unique knowledge of how to produce these chemicals to > 95% pure fractions. The state of this knowledge has been summarized in the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) report filed in May 2000 (EIR-I-024-00) and in 3 provisional patent applications (U.S. Patent Appln. Ser. No. 09/595.034, 09/595.035, 09/595.177).  These patents list Dr. Karchesy and 3 CDC/DVBID researchers as inventors.  We have been working collaboratively with Dr. Karchesy at OSU on developing these patented compounds for public health use since 1992.  Dr. Karchesy is highly trained to isolate, identify, and provide us with compounds exhibiting potential biocidal and repellent activity based on laboratory bioassays performed here at CDC/DVBID.  Dr. Karchesy is also developing a method to synthesize these compounds from cheap forest residues for the production of “mixtures” which will be necessary for potential commercialization of these natural product compounds for public health use.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow CDC to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  FERC05C50175 is issued as a request for proposal and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-25 correction. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number 519190, All Other Information Services, and the size standard is $6,000,000.

Statement of Work:  1. INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires a disaster recovery facility that supports the general support system (GSS) and e-Library systems Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) and the FERC Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). The facility must be activated and operational following the declaration of a disaster that disables the primary facility. The facility must be capable of hosting the GSS infrastructure and providing retrieval of documents for the eLibrary system via the internet using current eLibrary web interfaces.

2.  BACKGROUND.  The GSS provides core computing resources and functionality to FERC’s staff at its Washington D.C. location at 888 1st St., NE.  For the purpose of this RFP this includes email, network storage, Active Directory domain structure, and database hosting.  The eLibrary system (formerly known as FERRIS) is a database system that manages, stores, and retrieves documents that have been received or issued by the FERC after November 16, 1981, plus a very limited number of older document files and dockets that have been retrofitted into the system. There are currently 2.5 million documents in the system and about 1.6 million files that are referenced in the documents.

3. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORT. 3.1 Technical Requirements.  FERC has identified one option for creating a disaster recovery site. Offerors are encouraged to suggest their own interpretation on the selected option and the associated recovery time.  A general description follows:  Hot Standby. The contractor maintains a secondary site that meets all requirements but data is not synchronized and no traffic is directed to the site. In the event of a disaster data backups must be restored before traffic can be re-directed to the site. Recovery time should be within twelve to twenty-four hours of declaring an emergency.

Recovery time would optimally be within twelve to twenty-four hours of declaring an emergency. FERC is primarily concerned with a solution that is affordable and is secondarily concerned with the objective of restoring within an optimal timeframe. Offerors are encouraged to propose solutions that are comparable in cost to Warm Standby (equipment is on-hand or acquisition times are minimal), but innovative in addressing the 24 hour objective.
 

3.1.1 Infrastructure and Environmental requirements. In order to guarantee availability and support the recovery at a secondary location due to a disaster, certain minimal requirements exist.  The facility must not be within a 20 mile radius of the primary site (888 1st St.) and all equipment and all systems listed must have N+1 redundancy.  The contractor’s facility must provide the following:

•	Completely redundant and dedicated; 100Mb/s or higher Public Internet access; 
•	100Mb Ethernet switched backbone;
•	The network must be protected by a properly configured, stateful inspection, hardened operating system firewall with intrusion detection.  The firewall must also have the ability to create a standard IPSEC 3DES VPN with other firewalls.  Preferably a Cisco PIX firewall would be used;
•	Adequate facility security including features such as 24 hour a day manned and video security monitoring of the facility and access to the facility is restricted to facility customers and is verified with a combination of ID check, biometrics and/or a “man trap”.  Access to the FERC equipment shall be further restricted to FERC authorized individuals;
•	The facility must provide redundant A/C power and on site diesel generators with sufficient fuel to last for 2 days with contracts for additional fuel delivery
•	Access to the facility must be possible 24 hours a day 365 days a year to designated, authorized FERC personnel.
•	The facility must be able to maintain a temperature between 62 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit
•	The facility must have a multi-zone fire suppression system
•	To control flooding the facility must be built above sea level, without having equipment located in a basement, and with proper drainage and a moisture detection system
•	Facility must not be located in seismic zones 4 or 3 and must be location specific seismic compliant.  Non-structural components and equipment must be anchored and braced in accordance with the requirements of the 1997 Uniform Building Code

3.1.2. Hardware/Technical requirements. In addition to the requirements below, the contractor must have the ability to restore data from the following media types; DLT, SDLT, DAT, DLT4 and 12” 30GB Optical WORM (for FileNet).

3.1.2.1 GSS. The GSS can be broken down into several distinct components including; Exchange 2000, Active Directory, Network Storage, and database hosting.  Each of these components has their own technical design and hardware requirements.

Exchange 2000 is used by FERC to provide email functionality for its staff.  The system currently consists of 1,063 mailboxes with a total private storage totaling 133GB.  In the event of a disaster these mailboxes must be accessible from a remote location via the Internet using POP3, MAPI, and HTTP.  Security can be assured by creating a site to site VPN from the remote location to the DR facility.  When the disaster occurs, the entire current mailbox content will be restored to the secondary facility’s Exchange system.  When the disaster has passed and the system is being transitioned back to the primary facility all current content from the secondary facility will be imported.  To provide minimal functionality the system must have the following specifications:  Intel Dual 2.7 GHz, 3GB Ram, and 200GB storage.

FERC’s Active Directory infrastructure is required to provide authentication services as well as support the Exchange 2000 system.  Overall the AD system has approximately 5,000 objects, 100 organization units and 11 domain controllers.  During a disaster a VPN must be in place with the proper ports open to the remote location to allow authentication and communication with the AD domain controllers.  At a minimum two domain controllers will be required with the following specifications:  Intel Single 2.7 GHz, 2GB Ram, and 40GB storage.

Network storage must be made available via Windows network shares and provide a total 3TB of space.  Client systems must be able to access their data during the disaster utilizing the site to site VPN.   For remote users, a SharePoint Portal server will be used to provide secure web access to files in the network storage system.  The SharePoint server needs to have the following specifications:  Single 2.4Ghz, 1GB Ram, and 40GB of storage.  Additionally some users and regional offices will utilize a VPN client to connect through the secondary facility firewall to allow access to files and applications.

FERC has many online programs that depend on the functionality of their database systems.  All database systems are currently hosted on the Windows 2000 platform and consist of thirteen SQL 7.0, and four SQL 2000 databases with a combined total of 145GB of data.  The secondary facility will need to have two servers, one for each type of database system.  The SQL 2000 server needs to have a Single 2.4Ghz, 1GB Ram, and 140GB of storage.  The SQL 7.0 server should have a Single 2.4Ghz, 2GB Ram, and 160GB storage.  

 3.1.2.2 eLibrary. There are three servers that are required for minimal operation of the eLibrary system, the web server, Verity server, and FileNet/Oracle server.  Each of these systems must meet or exceed the specifications of the current systems and the applications that are to be installed on them.  In addition to these requirements each system must have access to a shared super DLT320 tape drive or its own in order to facilitate the restoration of data from the primary site.  Each system must be of sufficiently small form factor so as not to incur additional costs due to space requirements in the cabinet.  Each system must also utilize RAID 1 or 5 in achieving the required drive space.

The web server must be a rack mountable Pentium single processor 2.4 GHz or higher with 2GB of RAM.  This system will be running Windows 2000, fully patched with sufficient virus protection.  Additionally it must have at least 2GB of free hard drive space not including the operating system.

The Verity server must be a rack mountable dual processor Pentium 3GHz or higher with 2GB of RAM.  This system should be running Windows 2000 server, fully patched with sufficient virus protection.  Additionally it must have at least 90GB of free hard drive space not including the operating system.

The FileNet/Oracle server must be a rack mountable dual processor 64bit 1.2 GHz or higher with 2 GB of RAM.  This system should be running AIX 5.2.  It must also have at least 1.2TB of internal or external storage available not including the operating system to load the optical disks into cache.

The FileNet system must have a direct connection to an optical jukebox with a 12” 30GB drive to facilitate loading of the FileNet cache to the hard drive or the ongoing access to 40 optical platters for document retrieval.

3.1.3 Software requirements. 3.1.3.1 GSS. The following commercial software must be installed and maintained for minimal operational status of the GSS.  All software will be provided by FERC.

•	Microsoft Exchange 2000
•	Windows 2000 Server
•	Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) version 81
•	Microsoft SQL 7.0
•	Microsoft SQL 2000
•	SharePoint Portal Server 2003

3.1.3.2 eLibrary. The following commercial software must be installed and maintained for minimal operational status of the eLibrary system.  All software will be provided by FERC.

•	Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) version 9i
•	AIX 5.2
•	FileNet Panagon Image Services 4.0
•	FileNet Web Services

•	AccuSoft NetVue 3.8
•	Informatix TiffDLL50
•	PKWare PKZip
•	Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, service pack 4
