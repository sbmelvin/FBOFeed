<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE<br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement for extracting nucleic acids from ticks, animal blood and tissue samples in order to detect pathogens in these samples. <br /><br />The CDC intends to award a sole-source purchase order to Life Technologies Corporation for the KingFisher FLEX system in order to satisfy the requirement. The authority for this action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 13.106-1; in particular, only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). There are four specific requirements:<br /><br />1. The system will be used to support testing of both laboratory and field-collected samples, which can total more than 10,000 per year. For efficiency, the system must process samples in 96-well plates.<br /><br />2. Column-based instruments do not reach optimal vacuum pressure at the altitude of the laboratory (5,000 feet above sea level) resulting in poor quality nucleic acid samples. A nucleic acid extraction system that relies on magnetic particle separation technology must be used which does not rely on a vacuum.<br /><br />3. Because nucleic acids are extracted from different sample types, an "open" system is required that will allow the agency to optimize extraction for each sample type.<br /><br />4. The system must fit into dedicated nucleic acid extraction space to limit the risk of sample contamination during extraction. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. This is only an opportunity to provide specific and convincing information that the requirement should instead be competed and the respective capabilities of the responder. All such responses received by the closing date / time of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government whether or not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<SOLNBR>F16PS00889

<ARCHDATE>08112016
<CONTACT>Rodriguez, Lisa
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) International Affairs, Division of Scientific Authority intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement), 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 1200 New York Ave NW STE 712, Washington, DC 20005-3929.  AAAS will provide one Fellow for conservation, biology, program management expertise and communication skills to develop and implement this project which is designed to enhance wildlife law enforcement capabilities to combat wildlife trafficking in several key countries in Southeast Asia.  The USFWS Strengthening Wildlife Enforcement and Combating Wildlife Trafficking in Southeast Asia project targets several key areas and activities for intervention through assessing current needs, and provision of technical assistance, training and support.  The planned life of this project is two years following which we will have substantially developed enforcement capacity and performance throughout the region, leading to increased enforcement efforts, including arrests and prosecutions, and reductions in poaching and illegal trade in the region.  Therefore, the International Affairs program seeks to contract with AAAS to host a fellow from September 1, 2016 through August 30, 2017.

This action is intended to be awarded without competition for the following reason. AAAS is the only organization that can provide the level of required talent required for the Fellowships provided under these contracts, based on its experience, network of member and affiliated organizations, and extensive outreach efforts. AAAS provides broad networks to support Fellows at federal agencies, and from which to recruit highly qualified fellowship applicants. The organization was established in 1848, and is the worldÂ¿s largest federation of scientific and engineering societies, with more than 120,000 members. Its 260+ affiliated organizations span all fields of the biological and physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering. The AAAS Fellowships collaborate directly with more than 30 scientific and engineering societies to recruit and place Fellows in the U.S. government.  AAASs' unique ability to attract the best and most comprehensive array of scientists interested in year-long fellowships in support of public policy justifies this sole source contract. Selection of AAAS is consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's authority (5 CFR 213.3102(r)) to utilize fellowship programs aimed at attracting individuals with specialized knowledge for a limited timeframe.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813920, Professional Organizations with a size standard of $7 million. This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. However, firms that believe they can provide these services in their entirety must submit a written notification of interest and capability to the Contracting Officer by the date and time indicated. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Questions or comments pertaining to this action or written notification of interest and capability may be emailed to Lisa Rodriguez, Contracting Officer at lisa_rodriguez@fws.gov or call (505) 248-6797, not later than 1200 (EDT), July 27, 2016.

<p>PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR CERTIFICATIONS SHOWING PAST EXPERIENCE FOR THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH, YOUR DUNN AND BRADSTREET NUMBER, BUSINESS SIZE, CONTACT EMAIL, NAME, PHONE, COMPANY NAME.</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Project Title: Pacific Billfish and Tuna Biological and Stock Assessment Support</p>
<p>Southwest Fisheries Science Center, <br />8901 La Jolla Shores Drive<br />La Jolla, CA 92037</p>
<p>Base Period: September 15, 2016-September 14, 2017<br />Option Year 1: September 15, 2017-September 14, 2018</p>
<p><br />Overview</p>
<p>The contractor should be an established billfish scientist and will conduct life history and fisheries research in support of North Pacific billfish stock assessments. The research is organized into two collaborative research projects. Project 1 will focus on the estimation of life history parameters and collection of size data for key billfish species (Pacific blue marlin, North Pacific striped marlin, sailfish, and wahoo), as well as tissue samples from Pacific bluefin tuna, caught in Taiwanese longline and set net fisheries. The size data will be merged with existing logbook and observer data from Taiwanese longline and set net fisheries to estimate fishery-specific size-at-catch frequency distributions for input into stock assessments. The tissue samples will be processed for genetic markers. Project 2 will be a comparative study between fleets harvesting North Pacific swordfish in the Pacific Ocean. The research projects, associated tasks and budget are specified in greater detail below.</p>
<p>1. Collaborative Life History Parameter Estimation and Genetic Identification</p>
<p>This has been a collaborative project between scientists from NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), National Research Institute for Far Seas Fisheries (NRIFSF), National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU), National Taiwan University (NTU), Shanghai Ocean University (SHOU) and Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). The goal of the project is to collect size-at-catch data and biological samples from Pacific blue marlin, North Pacific striped marlin, sailfish, wahoo, and Pacific bluefin tuna landed in Taiwan to support the completion of billfish stock assessments in the Pacific Ocean and tuna genetic identification. North Pacific swordfish and striped marlin stock assessments are scheduled for 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Pacific Bluefin tuna genetics data will provide information on stock structure and abundance estimates. Collaborators will include Kotaro Yokawa (NRIFSF), (SWFSC), (PIFSC), (NTOU), (NTU) and (IATTC). Other collaborators may be identified as the research proceeds.</p>
<p>The contractor will conduct size-at-catch sampling of Pacific blue marlin, North Pacific striped marlin, sailfish and wahoo, as well as the collection of Pacific Bluefin tuna tissue samples, landed by Taiwanese longline fleets and set net fisheries at major billfish and tuna ports in Taiwan. Hard parts (e.g., fin ray spines) and reproductive material (gonads) will also be collected from landed blue marlin, striped marlin, sailfish and wahoo to facilitate the estimation of life history parameters, including age and growth and age-at-maturity. To the extent possible size-at-catch data will be combined with Taiwanese logbook and observer data to develop fishery-specific size-at-catch frequency distributions. Estimated life history parameters will be combined with existing data to reduce uncertainty in existing age-length keys and maturity ogives. Pacific Bluefin tuna tissue samples will be collected and processed for genetic markers. The genetic marker data will be combined with similar data from other fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean targeting Pacific Bluefin tuna to assess trans-Pacific movement rates and stock structure, as well as requisite data to develop estimates of abundance.</p>
<p>2. Collaborative North Pacific Swordfish Size and CPUE Fleet Comparisons</p>
<p>This is a collaborative project between scientists from SWFSC, NRIFSF, and IATTC. The goal is to conduct fleet specific comparative studies on swordfish size-at-catch data and relative abundance estimates to support completion of a North Pacific swordfish stock assessment in July 2017. Research results will be presented at the Intercessional meeting of the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) Billfish Working Group workshops tentatively scheduled for January and April 2015. Collaborators will include (NRIFSF), (SWFSC), and (IATTC). Other collaborators may be identified as the research proceeds.</p>
<p>The contractor will assist with the compilation of all available catch, effort and size-at-catch data. Datasets will include (1) Japanese longline data from logbooks, (2) length frequency data from Japanese research and training vessels, (3) Hawaii longline data from logbooks and associated length frequency data, (4) Taiwan longline data from logbooks and associated length frequency data, and (5) other longline fleets as necessary. The contractor will conduct comparative analyses to determine fleet specific differences and assess the feasibility of substitution of data between fleets. These analyses, combined with fleet-specific fisheries operational data, will also be used to estimate selectivity patterns between fleets, and incorporated into the 2017 North Pacific swordfish stock assessment.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>All work will be completed at the contractor's institution. An initial meeting with collaborators to discuss data availability and port sampling design will be convened shortly after the start of the contract. Monthly progress will be discussed with the Agency Contact and collaborators via conference calls. Quarterly progress reports will be submitted to the Agency Contact during the contract period and progress reports presented at intercessional ISC Billfish Working Group and Pacific Bluefin Tuna Workshops. A final report will be presented at the July 2017 ISC Billfish and Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group Workshops at the conclusion of the project.</p>
<p>Quarterly reports should include spatiotemporal biological sampling statistics, as well as size-at-catch frequency plots for sampled billfish and tuna. Additionally, quarterly reports should describe progress on the (1) estimation of life history parameters, (2) processing of Pacific bluefin tuna tissue samples, (3) compilation of available North Pacific swordfish catch statistics from fisheries operating in the North Pacific Ocean, and (4) comparative analyses to determine specific differences between fisheries.</p>
<p>The final report should define Pacific Bluefin stock structure and movement rates, results of the Pacific Bluefin tuna genetic analyses, final species specific size-at-catch frequency plots, and final estimates of life history parameters for billfish and tuna.</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria</p>
<p>Choice of contractor will be based on five criteria: <br />(1) Cost to complete the work; <br />(2) Qualifications of the contractor. At least 15 years of experience conducting<br />billfish or tuna biological research to support stock assessments, 10 years of experience collecting biological samples at Taiwanese fishing ports and experience conducting research through a collaborative approach (additional consideration would be given to vendors whose collaborations included scientists from Japan, China and Taiwan; <br />(3) Experience conducting similar biological research on billfish or tuna stocks, additional consideration would be given to vendors conducting this research in Taiwan; <br />(4) Acessability to logbook and observer data housed at Taiwan's Overseas<br />Fisheries Development Council (OFDC) and <br />(5) Acessability to landing ports and laboratory facilities to process and analyze<br />biological samples.</p>
<p><br />Invoicing will be Monthly in equal amounts in arrears.</p>

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>

<p>4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>

<p>a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.</p>
<p>b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.</p>
<p>2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).</p>
<p>(d) Findings and Corrective Actions</p>
<p>1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:</p>
<p>a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and</p>
<p>b. Coordinate remedial action with the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Department of Commerce Actions</p>
<p>1. The Department of Commerce may accept the Contractor's findings or proceed with its own investigation, in which case the Contractor shall fully cooperate with the investigation. The<br />Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor of the Department's final determination.</p>
<p>2. The Department of Commerce reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract and applicable laws and regulations. Such remedies and actions may include, but are not limited to, disallowance of costs, recoupment of contract payments, and suspension or debarment.<br />(End of provision)<br />1352.239-72 Security Requirements for Information Technology Resources (APR 2010)<br />(a) Applicability.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

<p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:<br />HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month<br />VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br />HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)<br /><br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<br />1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.<br />Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<br />2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:<br />The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **<br />Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage<br />and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage<br />rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies<br />as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of<br />the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The<br />relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties)<br />contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting<br />"arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a)<br />of the regulations. This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage<br />rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.<br />The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.<br />REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}<br />Conformance Process:<br />The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.<br />The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br />1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br />2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.<br />3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br />4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.<br />5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<br />6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br />Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
