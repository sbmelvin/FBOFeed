<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID.&nbsp; PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.&nbsp; TENTATIVE ADVERTISEMENT DATE IS OCT 25, 2013.&nbsp; PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME.<br /><br /></strong>PROJECT DETAILS: ND PRA THRO 11(6), South Unit Loop Road
<p>Theodore Roosevelt National Park is located in the badlands of western North Dakota. The majority of the work in the park will be performed in South Unit with some additional work in the North Unit. The project consists of three different possible award schedules (A, B and C) and one option (X). The project locations are as follows:<br /><br />South Unit: The South Unit entrance is in Medora, ND. Medora is accessible via Interstate 94 Exits 24 and 27 in North Dakota. Medora is 133 miles west of Bismarck, ND and 27 miles east of the Montana state line.<br /><br />North Unit: The North Unit entrance is along U.S. Highway 85, approximately 16 miles south of Watford City, ND and 50 miles north of Belfield, ND. The distance by road from Medora to the North Unit is approximately 70 miles. I-94 travelers can access U.S. Highway 85 at Exit 42 in Belfield, ND.<br /><br />ND FTNP THRO 11(6), South Unit Loop Road: work in the South Unit will include resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation (3R) of the existing roadway; ERFO repair work will be performed in the North Unit. <br /><br />The 3R work in the South Unit will consist of roadway survey and layout, cement or fly ash treated roadway pulverization, Superpave asphalt resurfacing, and concrete work (curb, gutter, parking stalls and sidewalks). Traffic will have to be maintained at all times during construction. The contractor will be responsible for surveying the existing roadway and laying out the new roadway profile to correct any and all deficiencies and undulations. All pulverized surfaces will be resurfaced within 14 days. A material transfer vehicle (MTV) will be required for all Superpave asphalt resurfacing. All concrete work will be colored according to the contract documents. A majority of the concrete work involves parking stalls and sidewalks that will be required to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. <br /><br />The ERFO repair work in the North Unit include survey, embankment construction with placement of geogrid, sub-excavation (entire roadway width at over 6' deep), drainage, paving, erosion control, permanent and revegetation. Traffic will be maintained during construction with lane closures for part of the work. The other part of the repair work in the North Unit will be closed to traffic. This work has to be completed prior to May 15, 2014 so it may have to be performed under severe winter or wet conditions.</p>
<p><br />Major quantities include (quantities depend on which schedule is awarded):</p>
<p>&bull; Soil erosion control, sediment wattle: 3,900 - 11,000 LNFT</p>
<p>&bull; Cement or fly ash treated pulverization/aggregate stabilization: 37,000 - 116,000 SQYD</p>
<p>&bull; Superpave asphalt pavement : 6,500 - 20,600 TON</p>

<p>&bull; Embankment construction: 3,570 CUYD</p>
<p>&bull; Placement of biaxial geogrid: 10,210 SQYD</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in late-October 2013. Notice to proceed for construction will be on April 1, 2014. Estimated cost for the schedule(s) and option range from $4 to $10 million.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-13-G-0009 on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training (MST) in Owego, NY. The effort is for NRE to address the Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and obsolete parts in legacy MH-60Rs by upgrading the Electronic Support Measures (ESM) SP-103A Single Board Computer (SBC) to the SP-103E SBC.
<p>The NRE must ensure the current SP-103C SBC Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) configured ALQ-210 Weapons Replaceable Assembly (WRA) can be interchanged with the upgraded SP-103E SBC SRA and maintain the same capabilities. Additional NRE efforts include the following: conversion of the legacy ALQ-210 (WRA) in the 103A SBC SRA configuration to the current production configuration; make the SP-103E SBC SRA a Form-Fit-Function (FIT) substitute item for the SP-103C SBC SRA; and ensure fleet maintainers can use either the SP-103C or SP-103E SBC SRAs in all MH-60R ALQ-210 WRAs capable of being repaired in post-production years.</p>
<p>Options will be used in the resultant Order to perform the work described above and will include, but are not limited to, the following efforts: NRE to address the most cost effective conversion process that shall not degrade mission capabilities and performance of the current SP-103C SBC SRA; Integration efforts and; testing of the SP-103C and SP-103E SBC SRA in a retrofitted ALQ-210 WRA. Recurring efforts will include purchase and installation of retrofit kits to upgrade legacy ALQ-210 WRAs to current configuration with 103E SBC SRAs.</p>
<p>This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin MST in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;" because they are the only qualified source which possesses the detailed knowledge of the MH-60 mission systems design to allow them to perform the NRE and upgrade efforts in a timely and cost effective manner. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by NAVAIR. Questions concerning subcontracting opportunities should be directed to Ms. Cathy Gasper at (607) 751-4727.</p>

<SUBJECT>T-AO(X) Market Research Request - Engine Technologies
<SOLNBR>N0002414R2224
<RESPDATE>111213
<CONTACT>Cherissa Tamayori, Email cherissa.tamayori@navy.mil - Christina Zimmer, Contracting Officer, Email christina.zimmer@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Department of Navy (DoN), on behalf of the Program Manager for Auxiliary Ships/Small Boats &amp; Crafts (PMS325), for information and planning purposes only. PMS325 is conducting market research in support of preliminary planning for the Fleet Replenishment Oiler (T-AO 187 Class) recapitalization. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.
<p>The T-AO(X) Program will be a non-developmental program utilizing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment. The new oilers will comply with all environmental protection requirements in place at time of contract award. Emphasis will be placed on lowering Total Ownership Costs (TOC) in the design and operation of the new oilers without compromising reliability.</p>
<p>PMS325 is soliciting engine technology information for COTS engines with a nominal rating of 2 MW to 15 MW and their associated support systems for the purpose of reducing fuel consumption, treating exhaust emissions, and utilizing low sulfur distillate fuels. Specific areas of interest include:</p>
<p>Performance and Fuel Consumption: The T-AO(X) projected operating profile anticipates the majority of operation at low to moderate engine loads. Efficient fuel consumption at low to moderate loads is more important than fuel consumption at rated power in order to obtain optimum annual fuel consumption. <br /><br />1. The T-AO(X) projected operating profile anticipates the majority of operation at low to moderate engine loads. What techniques are available to minimize fuel consumption in the 30% to 60% load range without derating to such an extent that additional cylinders are needed to achieve rated power?<br /><br />2. The T-AO(X) projected operating profile anticipates prolonged operation in the 10% to 20% load range. What techniques are available to permit prolonged low power operation without causing reliability issues or undue maintenance increase?<br /><br />3. Loading Schedule: What is the rate of loading restrictions for up power and down power maneuvers?<br /><br />4. The T-AO(X) will operate in Environmental Control Areas (ECA) and in non-ECAs. Tier III compliance will be required when operating in ECAs and Tier II performance will be required when operating in non-ECAs. It is anticipated that Selective Catalytic Reactors (SCR) operation may be required to achieve Tier III emissions and the SCR will be secured when Tier III emission compliance is not required. Will there be any difference in engine performance when operating with the SCR and when is the SCR is secured? Describe any performance differences.</p>
<p>Exhaust Emission Treatment: Tier III emission compliance may require exhaust after treatment by means of SCR. SCR information in the following areas is of interest:<br /><br />1. SCR Performance: Available literature indicates that SCR utilized for meeting Tier III emissions requirements should have the incoming engine exhaust temperature in the nominal range of 300o C to 400o C. T-AO(X) will be required to operate in ECAs that can have ambient conditions that range from arctic to tropical conditions. Given this range of environmental conditions and an operating profile that will range from less than 10% power to full power on any given engine, what provisions are available to maintain engine exhaust temperature in the range of 300o C to 400o C regardless of ambient temperature and power level?<br /><br />2. Urea Consumption: How is urea consumption estimated versus engine load? Is it dependent on exhaust temperature entering the SCR? Are there any unique requirements for the storage, pumping and transfer of urea such as maintaining the liquid within a given temperature range or freeze protection?<br /><br />3. SCR Installation: What SCR installation guidance is available? For example, are there guidelines for distance between the urea injection point and the SCR? Can the exhaust duct between the urea injection point and the SCR be either horizontal or vertical? What materials are recommended for SCR equipped engine exhaust systems and supporting piping systems? What quantities of services (such as electric power and compressed air) are required? What amount of space is required for maintenance accesses, etc.? <br /><br />4. SCR Operation: What does the operator have to do to start-up, operate, and shutdown an SCR system? Is a warm-up period required before an SCR produces acceptable emissions, and if so, how long? When operating outside of an ECA, is engine exhaust gas still passed through the SCR or is an exhaust gas bypass required? Does passing exhaust gas through a secured SCR consume catalyst life? If exhaust gas is passed through a secured SCR, should the exhaust gas still be maintained in the range of 300o C to 400o C? What parameters are monitored to assure proper operation? How does an operator determine that the catalyst requires replacement? When securing an SCR, what is done when the associated engine that will be left in operation? What will be done if the associated engine is also being secured?<br /><br />5. SCR Controls: Are there any regulatory body required control and monitoring features? What control and monitoring features are typically integrated into the ship's machinery control system?<br /><br />6. SCR Maintenance: What is the scope of inspection and maintenance required for an SCR system? How long do the catalyst blocks last? Is catalyst life dependent on a combination of power level and operating hours? Are there any special storage requirements for spare catalyst blocks or special provisions for disposal of spent catalyst blocks? Is replacement of catalyst blocks something that typically can be done by the crew or is outside assistance required?<br /><br />7. SCR Reliability: Is there any reliability data available for SCR systems? What is the life expectancy for an SCR system? What sort of failures have SCRs experienced? Will any of these failure modes impact the availability/operation of the associated engine?</p>
<p>Fuel Utilization and Fuel Systems: The Navy utilizes distillate fuels, including JP-5, and future distillate fuels are projected to have very low viscosity and lubricity. It is anticipated that common rail fuel systems will be standard for most diesel engines in the range of interest. The following information is of interest:<br /><br />1. Fuel Viscosity: T-AO(X) fuel specifications identify the fuels that the T-AO(X) will utilize. Some of these specifications allow viscosities less than 2.0 cSt at 40o C. U.S. Navy fuel practices, such as substitution of NATO Symbol F44 (JP-5) for NATO Symbol F76 (DFM), can result in the need for an engine to operate continuously for extensive periods of time on fuels with viscosities less than 2.0 cSt. What provisions are available to operate an engine continuously on fuels that can have viscosities less than 2.0 cSt at 40o C? Will these provisions require engine design modifications or will techniques such as fuel coolers be adequate?<br /><br />2. Fuel Lubricity: T-AO(X) fuel specification requires fuels with a maximum lubricity of 520 micron at 60o C measured per ASTM D6079. Other regulations are requiring very low sulfur fuels. What service experience has been obtained with low sulfur fuels that meet this lubricity requirement? Are there any special features necessary in order to utilize this type of fuel?<br /><br />3. Common Rail System Reliability: Is there any reliability data available for Common Rail (CR) systems? What is the life expectancy for a CR system? What type of failures modes have CR systems experienced?</p>
<p>The submission should also include the following minimum information:</p>
<p>1. Name and address of offeror<br />2. Point of contact including name, title, phone and e-mail address<br />3. N00024-14-R-2224</p>

<a href="mailto:donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>This is a Special Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products. <br>  <br> This announcement reflects the new solicitation number to be used for SALT, and it is an update to the Sources Sought notice under Solicitation Number W15P7T-13-R-5002, which was originally posted on 24 June 2013, and was subsequently changed on 1 July 2013, 9 July 2013, and 12 July 2013. <br>   <br> The anticipated date for release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 15 January 2014.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP will be approximately thirty (30) days after release of the draft RFP; however, this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the draft RFP, and subsequently for the formal RFP, will be posted with response dates and instructions as applicable to this solicitation. <br>   <br> Based on Industry response to the earlier notices, the Government has modified its previous intent to award a sole source contract for SALT, and will now pursue a full and open competition effort.  The Government intends to award a single contract comprising of a one-year base period plus four (4) one-year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated support. <br>   <br> For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation. <br>  <br> After contract award, a total of thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government RDT&E activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and SIL activities).  These thirty (30) RDT&E assets are to be delivered at a rate of at least five (5) SALT units per month, commencing sixty (60) days after contract award until all thirty (30) units are delivered.  A cumulative total of 22 units need to be delivered within the first 120 days after contract award.  Delivery requirements for the remaining balance of 8 units will be specified in the solicitation, but is expected to reflect a delivery rate of at least five (5) SALT units per month. <br>  <br> It is the Government's intent to award the contract on the basis of best value to the Government using a tradeoff evaluation process.  <br>  <br> Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. <br>   <br> The above discussed intent is subject to change. <br>   <br> If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV. <br>   <br> This notice does not require a response from industry.  DO NOT submit any documentation / proposals / letters of any kind in response to this notice.  <br>  <br> All communications shall be submitted only in writing and should be submitted directly to the email address(es) identified below.  Contractors shall not contact any other government personnel other than the persons identified below.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individuals identified below could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award. <br>   <br> No classified information shall be submitted in response to this notice. <br>  <br> The designated ACC-APG point of contact for this action is Ms. Rachel Bogner, 443-861-4658, rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil.  <br>   <br> The alternate ACC-APG point of contact for this action is Mr.  Donald Morgan, 443-861-4628, donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil.   <br>  <br> No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit and award on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106 to GFI, Inc. of Harrison, AR. The Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB) of the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, has been tasked by the US Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to evaluate Modified FRP Matting as one of the emerging Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) technologies slated for technology transfer. This system has been flight certified; however, final user evaluations are required to determine what, if any, further system changes are required prior to system acquisition. The purchased mat sets will be used by the ERDC, AFCEC, and the USAF RED HORSE for operational testing, evaluation, and system refinement.  GFI, Inc. is the only company who sells the Modified FRP Matting Sets currently recommended by AFCEC and the ERDC. The Contracting Officer has determined in order to maintain consistency and complete the final user evaluations, the Modified FRP Matting Sets must be purchased from GFI, Inc. These capabilities make GFI, Inc. uniquely suited to provide the need of the required Matting Sets.

Government plans to provide Amendment to solicitation on 12 November with specific quantity size requirements (SEE NEXT DATE). <br /><br />21 November 2013 Interested parties provide Government with data results of thermal protection testing and windblast testing. Government anticipates updating quantity and size requirements to the (15 Oct 13) posted solicitation. Parties that are unable to meet this due date for the windblast test results and thermal values will be unable to participate. This particular data modeling is the only test of its kind and is only offered to the Government for a single testing time period. It is imperative that interested parties meet this date for submission. Rational for timeframe is done in a sequence and in order to meet the Qualified Product List publish date, the Government MUST have all interested parties' data submissions in at this time. <br />7 January 2014 Government provides interested parties that have participated fully to date, the results from their company's particular data modeling tests.</p>
<p>11 March 2014, CWAS proposal is DUE from Offeror<br />NLT 1630 EST Offeror's proposal should be valid for 90 calendar days. Delivery for test assets should be anticipated to be delivered FOB Destination, within 120 days after award.</p>
<p>Government will evaluate all proposals on:<br />&bull; Technical Acceptability - ensemble must pass all testing requirements of the attached P-Spec to be considered acceptable<br />&bull; Past Performance - See FAR 13.106<br />&bull; Price - the lowest, single unit price and reasonableness</p>
<p>WHEN SUBMITTING PRICING SHEET. PRICES SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>1) UNIT Price - Price of all "layers" of your ensemble. Please include price breaks, up to 100 quantity units. ****Government will evaluate all proposals based on the price of one SINGLE unit.****</p>
<p>2) Price PER EACH LAYER of your model should also be provided (i.e. if you have a model that consists of more than one layer what would be the price if the Government were to buy each layer separately, etc). If you DO NOT OFFER the layers priced out separately please state that on your proposal. Price breaks offered for multiple quantities should be included if applicable, up to 100 units.</p>
<p>(a) The Government intends to award contracts to one or more contractors, depending on availability of funding, who successfully demonstrate that they passed the testing requirements of the attached Performance Specification (P-Spec) and conform to this solicitation. Offerors shall complete the attached P-Spec Compliance Worksheet supported by actual test reports, Certificates of Compliance for all Components (P-Spec para. 3.4).</p>
<p>(b) In the synopsis posted to FedBizOpps on 17 Sept 2013, interested vendors were requested to advise the Contracting Office of their intent to participate no later than 30 Sept 2013. If interested vendors were not able to advise the Contracting Office of their intent to participate by the date requested, vendors will not be excluded from participating in this solicitation as long as they meet the requirements of this solicitation by the proposal due date. This shall be a firm fixed price effort and is set aside for small business.</p>
<p>(c) The P-Spec requires that windblast testing (para 4.11.1) be completed first. Then, thermal protection testing (para. 4.10.2) should be completed using both the windblasted ensemble and a new, non-windblasted ensemble. If the interested parties want to continue to participate, all of the previously discussed testing results will be provided to the Government to complete additional data modeling at no cost. Data results from these tests, as well as photos (for the purposes of this evaluation photos are considered data) of the garments before and after windblast, should be provided at no cost to the Government by 12 Nov 2013. The Government will, at its expense, conduct Six Cylinder Thermoregulation Data Modeling which will take approximately 60 days. This test will determine if the ensemble meets the cold weather objective/threshold required in the P-Spec (para. 3.11.2). Once testing is complete, the results will be provided to the interested party. The determination to continue testing, while the Government performs the modeling, is strictly at the interested party's discretion. The Government will not reimburse the interested party for the costs of their testing. Those ensembles that successfully pass Six Cylinder Thermoregulation Data Modeling and pass all of the other material, end item, and systems level tests outlined in the P-Spec will potentially be purchased for use in Government run aircraft integration testing; if funding is available at the time of award. The Government only intends to purchase sufficient assets to perform integration testing, subject to the availability of funding.</p>
<p>(d) After testing is complete and if funding is available at the time it is anticipated that a firm fixed price contract will be awarded to one or more product "systems" which meet the technical requirements provided in the P-SPEC. If a down-selection is required due to funding limitations the pricing evaluation laid out in 1) above applies. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror(s) within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

The size standard is 500. Any small businesses who partner with a large business are reminded that they are required to perform 50% of the work on the effort to be eligible for consideration (FAR clause 52.219-8).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.<br />In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).<br />ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>FAR52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items is NOT applicable to this solicitation. In lieu of this provision the following evaluation procedures shall be used: Quotes will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Factor I: Technical</p>
<p>Subfactor a) Breakout / Exclude Parts List</p>
<p>Quotes shall include separately priced breakout/excluded parts. These are parts of the item being overhauled which have a low probability of failure, but have a high cost to repair or replace. These parts shall be separately priced and not included in the Offeror's standard firm fixed price. These identified parts must be listed on the Offeror's quote. These separately priced breakout/excluded parts shall include nomenclature, part number and price; additional labor to install shall not be included, as all labor shall be captured in the standard overhaul cost. Offerors shall be aware that all parts and material not separately listed in their quote as &lsquo;separately priced breakout/excluded parts' shall be considered included in their Firm Fixed Price overhaul quote.</p>
<p>Subfactor b) Experience</p>
<p>Quotes shall provide information describing their experience in overhauling the items listed in the SOW or items similar to those listed in the SOW. The information should include how many of the same or similar items the Offeror has overhauled in the past 24 months at their overhaul/repair facility.</p>
<p>Subfactor c) Technical Ability</p>
<p>Quotes shall describe current list of certifications including if the Offeror is an OEM certified repair/overhaul facility, FAA, Air Force Certified facility or have ever been approved by any Department of Defense agency to overhaul the items listed in the SOW or similar items.</p>
<p>Factor II: Past Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated base on the contractor's past performance timeliness of delivery (turn-around-time) and customer satisfaction. Offerors with no identifiable performance record will receive a neutral rating. The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other sources such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), (ALMIS - Delivery Performance by Vendor Report) and Government personnel who are experienced with the offerors performance.</p>
<p>Factor III: Price</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Prices that are extremely high or low in relation to the Government's estimate may be judged unrealistic and may indicate that the offeror has misunderstood the nature of the work to be performed. The Government intends to award a single contract for the overhaul of all equipment listed but reserves the right to break out CLINs and award more than one contract if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Price Quotes shall price ALL CLINS to be considered complete.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2013) <br />X Alternate I of 52.212-3 (Apr 2011)</p>

<DESC>Amendment #2 for this combined synopsis solicitation is to add ATF Clause 04, see clause below:
<p>ATF CLAUSE 04<br />BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS (Revised December 13, 2012)<br /><br />May 2010<br /><br />Personnel Security Requirements<br /><br />The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that all Contractor employees assigned hereunder shall undergo a background investigation or other applicable personnel security procedures to determine their suitability for access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities. For the purpose of this contract, the term background investigation will be utilized to also reference other personnel security procedures that may be applied in lieu of a full background investigation. <br /><br />The background investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch, Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide the necessary personnel suitability and security package in a timely manner, through the assigned Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), to ATF's Personnel Security Branch (PSB) so that a background investigation can be conducted. <br /><br />The Contractor shall screen and review each potential Contractor employee and ensure that each potential Contractor employee to be assigned to this contract possess a personal history that is in compliance with Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF agency specific qualifications and will permit each employee to successfully pass a background investigation conducted by the ATF. The Contractor shall not submit a personnel suitability and security package to the COR until the Contractor has screened the following aspects of each potential Contractor employee's personal history: <br />1.Criminal conduct<br />2.Financial responsibility<br />3.Drug use <br />4.Employment history<br />5.Employment eligibility<br />6.Selective Service registration, if applicable<br />7.U.S. Residency<br />8.Country of citizenship</p>
<p>During the Contractor's review of each potential Contractor employee's personal history, the Contractor is required to review each potential Contractor employee's personnel suitability and security package to ensure the forms are fully complete, signed, and dated.<br /><br />Prior to submitting a personnel suitability and security package, the Contractor shall utilize E-Verify to verify the employment eligibility of all Contractor employees, regardless of citizenship status. The Contractor will not submit a personnel suitability and security package when employment eligibility cannot be verified. The Contractor can register for E-Verify on-line at https://www.vis-dhs.com/employerregistration/. This website provides instructions for completing a Memorandum of Understanding required for official registration. Contractors requesting additional information about the program can visit the E-Verify website at www.dhs.gov/E-Verify or call the E-Verify program office at 1-888-464-4218.<br /><br />The Contractor must submit a copy of a tentative employment offer with the personnel suitability and security package when it is submitted on a potential Contractor employee.<br />The Contractor is hereby advised that a background investigation may take sixty (60) days or more to complete, depending on the complexity of the background investigation. The Contractor is encouraged to fill all positions with employees who have recently been the subject of a Federal background investigation. <br /><br />At the conclusion of the background investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will make a favorable or unfavorable determination and advise the COTR and the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO or the COR is responsible for advising the Contractor of ATF's determination. <br /><br />Contractor employees are not authorized to access ATF proprietary information, information technology systems, and/or facilities, until a favorable determination has been made by the Personnel Security Branch in accordance with agency specific qualifications, DOJ policy, Federal suitability, and/or adjudicative guidelines.<br /><br />All background investigations will be adjudicated applying the suitability standards under 5 CFR, part 731, as well as the following DOJ policy and ATF agency specific qualifications:<br /><br />(1)DOJ Residency Requirement. Immediately prior to gaining access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities the PSB staff ensures all Contractor employees have:<br /><br />(a)Resided in the United States for three (3) out of the last five (5) years; and/or<br /><br />(b)Worked for the United States in a foreign country in a Federal or military capacity for three (3) out of the last fives (5) years; and/or<br /><br />(c)Been a dependent of a Federal or military employee in a foreign country for three (3) out of the last five (5) years.<br /><br />(2)Allied Nations List. Contractor employees that only require access to ATF facilities must be United States citizens or foreign nationals legally permitted to reside in the United States. Their country of citizenship must be listed on the Allied Nations list published by the Department of State, Office of the Assistant Legal Advisor for Treaty Affairs. Since countries on this list are subject to change, refer to the following website for current information: http://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/collectivedefense/.<br /><br />(3)Drug Policy. ATF Drug Policy for ATF Applicants, is applied. The PSB ensures that ATF Contractor employees are compliant with the policy prior to authorizing access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities.<br /><br />(4)Selective Service. PSB will verify that all laws of the Selective Service are adhered to.<br /><br />(5)Financial Responsibilities. The PSB ensures compliance with DOJ guidance surrounding financial obligations. <br /><br />(a)Public Trust Positions - All financial obligations imposed by law must be favorably resolved through proof of payment and/or participation in a payment plan. For all other debt-related issues a risk management decision may be made in lieu of requiring payment or a payment plan. (Depending upon the position and debt history, PSB may require proof of payment and/or participation in a payment plan for financial delinquencies that are not imposed by law.)<br /><br />(b)National Security Positions - All delinquent financial obligations, even those not imposed by law, must be favorably resolved through proof of payment, and/or participation in a payment plan, or otherwise resolved.<br /><br />(6)Foreign Nationals Accessing Information Technology Systems. DOJ Order 2640.2F Information Technology Security, states non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems.<br /><br />(7)Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12. The PSB will conduct Personal Identity Verification to confirm the identity of the Contractor employee. Contractor employees must personally present two forms of identification in original form prior to accessing ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities. At least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID.<br /><br />In the event a contract employee is found to be non-compliant with the agency specific qualifications, PSB will notify the COR and the CO. The request for investigation will be terminated and the contractor may be requested to submit another name and complete personnel suitability and security package. Additional agency specific qualifications may be implemented without notice to the Contractor. <br /><br />Denial or Disapproval of Access to ATF Information, Information Technology Systems, and/or Facilities<br /><br />In the event that a Contractor employee is denied or disapproved for access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities due to issues found during the background investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will notify the COR and the CO. The contractor may be requested to submit another name and complete personnel suitability and security package.<br /><br />Freedom of Information Act Requests<br /><br />Once a determination has been made by the PSB, a Contractor employee may receive a copy of his/her background investigative file by submitting a written Freedom of Information Act request. The request must be addressed to the Disclosure Division, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 99 New York Avenue, NE, Suite 1E-400, Washington, DC 20226. It is the responsibility of the Contractor employee to assume all monetary liabilities associated with such request.<br /><br />Police Check Inquiries<br /><br />In those instances where the Contractor believes that its employees will not need unescorted access to ATF facilities, or access to any ATF proprietary information, data or information technology systems, the Contractor shall notify the COR. The COR will then apprise ATF's PSB of the Contractor's initial determination, citing the reasons thereof. The PSB, in consultation with the COR or the CO, will make the final determination as to whether or not the Contractor employee will need to undergo a background investigation. The nature and specific degree of background investigation will be determined by the PSB, depending upon the nature and degree of risk associated with the contract position. When ATF's PSB determines that the Contractor will require escorted access to ATF facilities, and/or ATF construction sites, or will only be provided with access to ATF non-sensitive information, the Contractor employee must undergo a criminal history check. The Physical Security Programs Branch or the respective field division/office is responsible for conducting the criminal history check and making the favorable or unfavorable determination. <br /><br />Access to Classified National Security Information <br /><br />In the event the Contractor employee requires access to classified National Security Information (NSI), in order to fulfill contractual requirements, the COR or the CO must contact the PSB. The PSB will assess the requirements and make a determination if access to NSI is required at the Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret level (which may or may not include access to Sensitive Compartmented Information. If the PSB determines that access to NSI is required, the contract must be modified to incorporate the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The PSB will provide additional personnel security language to the CO and coordinate all additional personnel security requirements of the NISP with the COR.<br /><br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p><br /><strong>QUESTION:</strong>The due date of 10/30 will be very difficult to meet. There is no product on the market today that meets these specs so the item will have to be designed from scratch or modified from the existing product. What are the possibilities of getting an extension?</p>
<p><br /><strong>GOVERMENT RESPONSE:</strong>Through extensive market research and requests for information (BEP-RFI-13-0222), the Government was able to determine that there are products on the commercial market that do meet the specifications listed in the Solicitation.

<p>52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE (JULY 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>PLATFORM ENGINEERING AND INTEGRATION FOR TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC SYSTEMS (PEITSS)<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />The U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battle Management Directorate, Theater Battle Control Division at Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking potential sources for Platform Engineering and Integration for Tactical and Strategic Systems (PEITSS). PEITSS is contemplated as a multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract that improves the Theater Battle Control Division's ability to incrementally field capabilities. Responsible sources with experience in integrating communications, command and control (C2), sensors, and other military systems and equipment onto ground platforms are requested to respond. <br />As defined herein, "platform" refers to ground vehicles (self-propelled, towed), operations centers/modules/shelters, and dismounted personnel. "System" refers to a system, subsystem, component, or other combination of hardware, software, interfaces, and/or procedures/ documentation that help perform an operational mission (e.g., communications, C2, targeting).<br />The PEITSS contract is intended to support programs within the Theater Battle Control Division (AFLCMC/HBD), including the Tactical Air Control Party Modernization (TACP-M) program. Other programs within and outside AFLCMC/HBD may utilize the PEITSS contract, if their efforts are within the PEITSS scope (see below). The IDIQ contract ordering period is anticipated to be up to 10 years. The contract ceiling for PEITSS is expected to be $500 million. <br /><br />The TACP-M Mobile Communications System (MCS) Increment 1 is expected to be the initial delivery order awarded under the PEITSS contract. MCS Increment 1 was separately synopsized on FedBizOpps.gov on 19 June 2012.<br /><br />NOTE: This sources sought synopsis is for market research and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Its issuance does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.<br /><br />2. Objectives and Scope<br />The Government seeks to satisfy the following primary PEITSS objectives: <br />a. Provide integration of systems onto platforms to achieve required operational capabilities.<br />b. Support incremental, timely delivery of capabilities, modifications, upgrades, and technology insertion.<br />c. Reduce contracting lead time and enable more rapid and efficient program execution.<br />d. Promote continuous and effective competition, leading to lifecycle affordability.<br />The scope of the PEITSS contract is anticipated to include:<br />a. System integration onto any platform, including: (1) Non-recurring engineering, design, and architecture development; (2) Hardware and software development incidental to the integration effort (e.g., firmware, configuration files); (3) Procurement of non-developmental hardware/software; and (4) production, fabrication, assembly, and installation.<br />b. Prototyping, studies, and analyses.<br />c. Test and evaluation (qualification, developmental, operational).<br />d. Support for certifications (information assurance, interoperability, etc.) and program protection, including identification of critical technologies.<br />e. Product support (logistics), including: (1) Training and training materials; (2) Manuals, Technical Orders and technical data package (TDP)/drawings; (3) Initial spares; and (4) Support equipment.<br />f. Interim contractor support (ICS)/contractor logistics support (CLS), including: (1) Help desk support and metrics capture; (2) Fixes, patches, upgrades, and technology refreshes; (3) Supply support (replenishment spares); and (4) Field/site support.<br />The Government's intent is that each PEITSS contractor/team must be able to perform to the full contract scope, to allow effective competition for individual orders.<br /><br />3. Information Requested<br />The Government requests responsible sources provide the following information: <br />a. Specific, recent capabilities and experience for performing system-platform integration as defined above and related to meeting the above PEITSS objectives and scope.<br />b. Specific experience on relevant IDIQ contracts, including contract number, Government organization, period of performance, total and remaining ceiling value, and Government contact with email and phone number.<br />c. Specific comments related to the breadth of the anticipated PEITSS scope in relation to meeting the PEITSS objectives.<br />d. Assessment of risks to and mitigation strategies/plans for meeting the PEITSS IDIQ contract objectives and scope. <br />e. Potential concepts and ideas for efficient, incremental approaches to systems integration. <br />f. Potential standards for achieving common architectures on platforms, to achieve more robust and flexible system integration. <br />g. Specific approaches for implementing incentives and performance-based efforts, including performance-based logistics.<br />h. Specific approaches to meeting or exceeding DoD/USAF small business goals while achieving the PEITSS IDIQ contract objectives and scope.<br />i. Identification and assessment of potential data management strategies, including data rights, for achieving the PEITSS objectives, including continuous and effective competition.<br />j. Preferred contract types (for IDIQ orders) and usual terms and conditions.<br />k. Identify your firm as a non-profit organization, large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, veteran owned business, service disabled veteran owned business, Section 8(a) small business, or hubzone small business for NAICS Code 334220.<br /><br />4.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE   <br>   Development of Distributed / Embedded Standard SATCOM On-The-Move Terminal Architecture (DESSTA)   <br>   <br> REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE <br> Development of Distributed / Embedded Standard SATCOM On-The-Move Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) <br>  <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.  <br> This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, or performance work statements, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <br>  <br> INTRODUCTION <br>  <br> The US Army Communications Electronics Research & Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) is interested in developing an open standard specification that will allow it to procure distributed aperture satellite communications antennas for on-the-move vehicular applications.  This Request for Information is a call to industry to provide your input to the specification.  The development of the open standard architecture will need to take into account the Army's goals for performance, integration and cost.  <br>  <br> PROBLEM STATEMENT <br>  <br> Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM WIN-T) Increment 3 is currently developing a product line that will include the capability of full networking on-the-move.  One of the challenges they face is the integration of a SOTM terminal onto ground vehicles such as the  quote mark heavy quote mark  PEO Ground Combat Systems (GCS) / PM Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) vehicles.  Distributed aperture terminals were identified as a technology that will help address this challenge. <br>  <br> Heavy vehicles present several unique integration challenges that can be mitigated by the use of distributed aperture terminals.  Typically, heavy vehicles have turreted weapon systems.  The turret has limited space (both interior and exterior) and power available for integration of a traditional SOTM terminal.  In this respect, a distributed aperture terminal offers additional integration flexibility in that the antennas can be mounted on the sides of the turret or some other suitable location on the exterior of the vehicle, thus presenting a distinct advantage over traditional terminals which must be mounted on the top of the turret.   <br>  <br> One of the main problems with mounting a traditional SOTM terminal on top of the turret is its close proximity to exposed turret personnel.  The SOTM terminal can present a radiation safety hazard to the commander, gunner or any other operator in close proximity to the SOTM terminal.   Distributed aperture terminals can mitigate this radiation hazard because the antennas can be mounted on the sides of the turret (or the sides of main vehicle body) and direct the radiation way from the vehicle hatch, or any other designated area. <br>  <br> When mounting a traditional SOTM terminal on the main body of a turreted vehicle, several other challenges arise.  The line of sight to the satellite can be blocked by the turret, significantly limiting the performance of the SOTM system.  Additionally, traditional SOTM systems also block sight lines and firing lines of the vehicle's own weapon systems.   <br>  <br> Traditional SOTM terminals require a minimum of 400 to 900 square inches of continuous vehicle surface area for antenna placement.  Distributed aperture SOTM terminals may require a similar aggregate area, but without the condition that it be continuous.  For distributed aperture terminals, both the top and the sides of the vehicle may be considered.   <br>  <br> Additional multifaceted challenges include: Functional layout of components that perform down/up conversion, analog to digital conversion, GPS and inertial navigation as well as control and tracking functions can cause difficulties and excessive costs when determining terminal design and placement of distributed SOTM terminal components on the inside or outside of the vehicle.  Additional cable runs and vehicle penetration points may be needed for the distributed aperture solution.  In the case of Heavy vehicles, it will be very restricted, if not forbidden, to add additional breaches to the vehicle hull.  A single entry point is likely required. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND <br>  <br> For several years CERDEC STCD has been developing the concept of distributed aperture SOTM terminals to address the challenges of integrating traditional SATCOM terminals in to vehicles with turrets and large weapon systems.  One of the Government funded Research and Development (R&D) efforts was the  quote mark Small Aperture X-Band Antenna - Distributed Broadband quote mark  or SAXBA BB. <br>  <br> The SAXBA BB terminal was designed and demonstrated to prove the concept of a distributed aperture SOTM terminal at reasonable unit production cost for PM WIN-T (~$150k, in quantities  greater than  100 was an objective for this program).  The SAXBA program was successful in meeting a reasonable unit cost for PM WIN-T.   <br>   <br>   <br> Figure 1.   SAXBA BB Terminal.  Four antenna <br>  subsystems,  and one core terminal subsystem shown. <br>  <br> Another lesson learned from the SAXBA broadband terminal effort has been continued support for the distributed aperture terminal concept.  This support has included funding throughout the life ( greater than  4 years) of the program from PM-WIN-T, as well as great interest from the heavy platform PM community (PEO GCS).    <br>  <br> While many lessons were learned from CERDEC's SAXBA and other Distributed Aperture SOTM research efforts, one question that remains unanswered is: What is the most effective Distributed Aperture SOTM terminal architecture that will allow performance (platform integration, flexible, modular, RF performance, etc) and cost goals to be met in all three frequency bands (X, Ku and Ka)?  <br>  <br> PM-WIN-T has an immediate need to integrate a SOTM terminal onto the heavy vehicles.  As such, CERDEC S&TCD has initiated a four year technology development program entitled, Low Observable Communications - Distributed / Embedded Standard SOTM Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) which started in FY 13. The DESSTA program will answer this need in the near term, but will also keep an eye on the long term goal of developing a family of cost effective terminals.  <br>  <br> The DESSTA program is intended to be a collaborative effort involving CERDEC S&TCD, PM WIN-T and select commercial/non-commercial partners.   DESSTA will first develop a baseline open standard architecture for distributed aperture SOTM terminals in X, Ku and Ka bands, and then develop a Ku band distributed aperture SOTM terminal prototype to align with the needs of the WIN-T program.   <br>  <br> The DESTA open standard architecture development effort for X/Ku and Ka bands will last over a 3-4 year period starting in FY13.  However, a baseline standard architecture for Ku band will be required by the end of FY13.  The baseline standard architecture will be updated as necessary throughout the period of the open standard development.   <br>  <br> The objective of the open standard is to reduce the cost of the distributed aperture terminal by promoting more modular terminal designs.  The standard will define the components of the distributed aperture SOTM terminal, the functionalities of each component, and the common interfaces between each component.  Within each component vendors will be able to implement their unique proprietary solutions.  <br>  <br> The distributed SOTM open standard architecture will be a standard that is not controlled by a single vendor, is not tied to a specific vendor's platform, is available for implementations by multiple sources, is published, and may be used without royalties or the need for non-disclosure agreements. <br>  <br> The DESSTA Ku band distributed aperture SOTM terminal prototype development effort will initiate in FY14, and adhere to the baseline of the open standard architecture.  The development effort will include, but not be limited to: <br> 1.	To design, implement, test and demonstrate (at TRL 6) a distributed aperture SOTM terminal in the Ku-Band over a 2 year period. <br> 2.	The terminal shall be testable to the baseline open standard distributed architecture, in addition to the relevant MIL-STD tests (MIL-STD-810F,MIL-STD-188 -164B). <br>  <br> SCOPE OF THIS RFI <br>  <br> For the purpose of the RFI CERDEC S&TCD is interested in establishing what each vendor considers as the best implementation of an open standard specification for the  architecture of the distributed aperture SOTM terminals in X, Ku and Ka Bands (Note: this is a single architecture that encompasses all three bands).  Additionally, CERDEC is interested in understanding existing component level technologies (antennas designs, low cost array manufacturing techniques, antenna tracking and control systems, etc) that can be used to develop the intended Distributed SATCOM terminal products. <br>  <br> Description of the open standard architecture should include, but not be limited to:  <br> a. The components of the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark .  <br> b. Functionality of each component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark . <br> c. What should be considered  quote mark Additional Components quote mark . <br> d. What interfaces exist in your distributed terminal architecture (internal / external). <br> e. Physical aspect (Ethernet cable, RF Cable, etc.) and functional description of each interface. <br> f. Trades used in making these architecture decisions. See next section for discussion. <br>  <br> Description of the Component Technologies and Capabilities: <br>  <br> a. Component name within your standard architecture <br> b. Functionality of each component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark . <br> c. Performance of this component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark . <br> d. Description of the component technology.   <br> 	For example: An  quote mark Antenna quote mark  component description may include: <br>  <br>  	Antenna element description <br>  	Aperture size (per quadrant) and thickness <br>  	Gain at boresight <br>  	Beamwidths <br>  	Polarization (fixed, selectable) <br>  	Scan limits/scan loss <br>  	Sidelobes/Backlobes <br>  	G/T <br>  	Taper loss (if any) <br>  	Phase shifter configuration (type, number of bits, etc) <br>  	Feed Network <br>  	Beemsteering Methodology  <br>  	Technology Readiness Level (TRL) <br>  	Level of Ruggedization - Environmental, EMI/EMC, etc. <br>  	Costs <br>  	Any other performance parameters that may impact the other components to which this will interface. <br>  <br> An  quote mark Antenna Control Unit quote mark  component may include: <br>  	Tracking Methods: beacon, monopulse, steptrack <br>  	Frequency and Timing sources <br>  	Tracking Loss <br>  	Cost <br>  	Any other performance parameters that may impact the other components to which this will interface. <br>  <br>  <br> ARCHITECTURE TRADES <br>  <br> Developing an open standard architecture will limit what terminals can be built using that architecture.  As such, it is necessary for the Government to understand what factors you considered in your concept for an Open Standard Architecture.  The government will weigh per unit cost, performance, and integration trades in evaluation of your Open Standard Architecture concept.  At a minimum the following relevant considerations should be addressed:  <br>  <br> Performance/Cost: For a distributed aperture terminal, where the conversion from radio frequency (RF) to an intermediate frequency (IF) is done, will greatly impact both the cost and performance.  Direct RF or IF digitization is of interest to the government. <br>  <br> Performance/Integration/Cost:  Which components that are distributed, and which components are outside and inside of the tactical vehicle will impact performance, cost and integration trades. <br>  <br> Performance/Integration/Cost: Low profile and non-traditional antenna designs.  The integration challenge for the heavy vehicles may require the development of low profile and non-traditional antenna designs to optimize performance in limited space.  The architecture should support these antenna designs.   <br>  <br> Additionally, the number of antennas and capability of the antenna needed to support a particular tactical vehicle may vary.  The integration location and space available for integration will drive this. The architecture should support different numbers of antennas as well as significantly different performance.   <br>  <br> Performance/Cost: Dynamic signal combining is an important aspect of the distribute aperture terminal architecture.

This Request for Information is a call to industry to provide your input to the specification.  The development of the open standard architecture will need to take into account the Army's goals for performance, integration and cost.   <br>    <br>  PROBLEM STATEMENT  <br>    <br>  Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM WIN-T) Increment 3 is currently developing a product line that will include the capability of full networking on-the-move.  One of the challenges they face is the integration of a SOTM terminal onto ground vehicles such as the  quote mark heavy quote mark  PEO Ground Combat Systems (GCS) / PM Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) vehicles.  Distributed aperture terminals were identified as a technology that will help address this challenge.  <br>    <br>  Heavy vehicles present several unique integration challenges that can be mitigated by the use of distributed aperture terminals.  Typically, heavy vehicles have turreted weapon systems.  The turret has limited space (both interior and exterior) and power available for integration of a traditional SOTM terminal.  In this respect, a distributed aperture terminal offers additional integration flexibility in that the antennas can be mounted on the sides of the turret or some other suitable location on the exterior of the vehicle, thus presenting a distinct advantage over traditional terminals which must be mounted on the top of the turret.    <br>    <br>  One of the main problems with mounting a traditional SOTM terminal on top of the turret is its close proximity to exposed turret personnel.  The SOTM terminal can present a radiation safety hazard to the commander, gunner or any other operator in close proximity to the SOTM terminal.   Distributed aperture terminals can mitigate this radiation hazard because the antennas can be mounted on the sides of the turret (or the sides of main vehicle body) and direct the radiation way from the vehicle hatch, or any other designated area.  <br>    <br>  When mounting a traditional SOTM terminal on the main body of a turreted vehicle, several other challenges arise.  The line of sight to the satellite can be blocked by the turret, significantly limiting the performance of the SOTM system.  Additionally, traditional SOTM systems also block sight lines and firing lines of the vehicle's own weapon systems.    <br>    <br>  Traditional SOTM terminals require a minimum of 400 to 900 square inches of continuous vehicle surface area for antenna placement.  Distributed aperture SOTM terminals may require a similar aggregate area, but without the condition that it be continuous.  For distributed aperture terminals, both the top and the sides of the vehicle may be considered.    <br>    <br>  Additional multifaceted challenges include: Functional layout of components that perform down/up conversion, analog to digital conversion, GPS and inertial navigation as well as control and tracking functions can cause difficulties and excessive costs when determining terminal design and placement of distributed SOTM terminal components on the inside or outside of the vehicle.  Additional cable runs and vehicle penetration points may be needed for the distributed aperture solution.  In the case of Heavy vehicles, it will be very restricted, if not forbidden, to add additional breaches to the vehicle hull.  A single entry point is likely required.  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND  <br>    <br>  For several years CERDEC STCD has been developing the concept of distributed aperture SOTM terminals to address the challenges of integrating traditional SATCOM terminals in to vehicles with turrets and large weapon systems.  One of the Government funded Research and Development (R&D) efforts was the  quote mark Small Aperture X-Band Antenna - Distributed Broadband quote mark  or SAXBA BB.  <br>    <br>  The SAXBA BB terminal was designed and demonstrated to prove the concept of a distributed aperture SOTM terminal at reasonable unit production cost for PM WIN-T (~$150k, in quantities  greater than  100 was an objective for this program).  The SAXBA program was successful in meeting a reasonable unit cost for PM WIN-T.    <br>     <br>     <br>  Figure 1.   SAXBA BB Terminal.  Four antenna  <br>   subsystems,  and one core terminal subsystem shown.  <br>    <br>  Another lesson learned from the SAXBA broadband terminal effort has been continued support for the distributed aperture terminal concept.  This support has included funding throughout the life ( greater than  4 years) of the program from PM-WIN-T, as well as great interest from the heavy platform PM community (PEO GCS).     <br>    <br>  While many lessons were learned from CERDEC's SAXBA and other Distributed Aperture SOTM research efforts, one question that remains unanswered is: What is the most effective Distributed Aperture SOTM terminal architecture that will allow performance (platform integration, flexible, modular, RF performance, etc) and cost goals to be met in all three frequency bands (X, Ku and Ka)?   <br>    <br>  PM-WIN-T has an immediate need to integrate a SOTM terminal onto the heavy vehicles.  As such, CERDEC S&TCD has initiated a four year technology development program entitled, Low Observable Communications - Distributed / Embedded Standard SOTM Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) which started in FY 13. The DESSTA program will answer this need in the near term, but will also keep an eye on the long term goal of developing a family of cost effective terminals.   <br>    <br>  The DESSTA program is intended to be a collaborative effort involving CERDEC S&TCD, PM WIN-T and select commercial/non-commercial partners.   DESSTA will first develop a baseline open standard architecture for distributed aperture SOTM terminals in X, Ku and Ka bands, and then develop a Ku band distributed aperture SOTM terminal prototype to align with the needs of the WIN-T program.    <br>    <br>  The DESTA open standard architecture development effort for X/Ku and Ka bands will last over a 3-4 year period starting in FY13.  However, a baseline standard architecture for Ku band will be required by the end of FY13.  The baseline standard architecture will be updated as necessary throughout the period of the open standard development.    <br>    <br>  The objective of the open standard is to reduce the cost of the distributed aperture terminal by promoting more modular terminal designs.  The standard will define the components of the distributed aperture SOTM terminal, the functionalities of each component, and the common interfaces between each component.  Within each component vendors will be able to implement their unique proprietary solutions.   <br>    <br>  The distributed SOTM open standard architecture will be a standard that is not controlled by a single vendor, is not tied to a specific vendor's platform, is available for implementations by multiple sources, is published, and may be used without royalties or the need for non-disclosure agreements.  <br>    <br>  The DESSTA Ku band distributed aperture SOTM terminal prototype development effort will initiate in FY14, and adhere to the baseline of the open standard architecture.  The development effort will include, but not be limited to:  <br>  1.	To design, implement, test and demonstrate (at TRL 6) a distributed aperture SOTM terminal in the Ku-Band over a 2 year period.  <br>  2.	The terminal shall be testable to the baseline open standard distributed architecture, in addition to the relevant MIL-STD tests (MIL-STD-810F,MIL-STD-188 -164B).  <br>    <br>  SCOPE OF THIS RFI  <br>    <br>  For the purpose of the RFI CERDEC S&TCD is interested in establishing what each vendor considers as the best implementation of an open standard specification for the  architecture of the distributed aperture SOTM terminals in X, Ku and Ka Bands (Note: this is a single architecture that encompasses all three bands).  Additionally, CERDEC is interested in understanding existing component level technologies (antennas designs, low cost array manufacturing techniques, antenna tracking and control systems, etc) that can be used to develop the intended Distributed SATCOM terminal products.  <br>    <br>  Description of the open standard architecture should include, but not be limited to:   <br>  a. The components of the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark .   <br>  b. Functionality of each component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark .  <br>  c. What should be considered  quote mark Additional Components quote mark .  <br>  d. What interfaces exist in your distributed terminal architecture (internal / external).  <br>  e. Physical aspect (Ethernet cable, RF Cable, etc.) and functional description of each interface.  <br>  f. Trades used in making these architecture decisions. See next section for discussion.  <br>    <br>  Description of the Component Technologies and Capabilities:  <br>    <br>  a. Component name within your standard architecture  <br>  b. Functionality of each component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark .  <br>  c. Performance of this component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark .  <br>  d. Description of the component technology.    <br>  	For example: An  quote mark Antenna quote mark  component description may include:  <br>    <br>   	Antenna element description  <br>   	Aperture size (per quadrant) and thickness  <br>   	Gain at boresight  <br>   	Beamwidths  <br>   	Polarization (fixed, selectable)  <br>   	Scan limits/scan loss  <br>   	Sidelobes/Backlobes  <br>   	G/T  <br>   	Taper loss (if any)  <br>   	Phase shifter configuration (type, number of bits, etc)  <br>   	Feed Network  <br>   	Beemsteering Methodology   <br>   	Technology Readiness Level (TRL)  <br>   	Level of Ruggedization - Environmental, EMI/EMC, etc.  <br>   	Costs  <br>   	Any other performance parameters that may impact the other components to which this will interface.  <br>    <br>  An  quote mark Antenna Control Unit quote mark  component may include:  <br>   	Tracking Methods: beacon, monopulse, steptrack  <br>   	Frequency and Timing sources  <br>   	Tracking Loss  <br>   	Cost  <br>   	Any other performance parameters that may impact the other components to which this will interface.  <br>    <br>    <br>  ARCHITECTURE TRADES  <br>    <br>  Developing an open standard architecture will limit what terminals can be built using that architecture.  As such, it is necessary for the Government to understand what factors you considered in your concept for an Open Standard Architecture.  The government will weigh per unit cost, performance, and integration trades in evaluation of your Open Standard Architecture concept.  At a minimum the following relevant considerations should be addressed:   <br>    <br>  Performance/Cost: For a distributed aperture terminal, where the conversion from radio frequency (RF) to an intermediate frequency (IF) is done, will greatly impact both the cost and performance.  Direct RF or IF digitization is of interest to the government.  <br>    <br>  Performance/Integration/Cost:  Which components that are distributed, and which components are outside and inside of the tactical vehicle will impact performance, cost and integration trades.  <br>    <br>  Performance/Integration/Cost: Low profile and non-traditional antenna designs.  The integration challenge for the heavy vehicles may require the development of low profile and non-traditional antenna designs to optimize performance in limited space.  The architecture should support these antenna designs.    <br>    <br>  Additionally, the number of antennas and capability of the antenna needed to support a particular tactical vehicle may vary.  The integration location and space available for integration will drive this. The architecture should support different numbers of antennas as well as significantly different performance.    <br>    <br>  Performance/Cost: Dynamic signal combining is an important aspect of the distribute aperture terminal architecture.  RF signals received on multiple antenna components will need to be combined such that the G/T of the system can be maximized when operating On-The-Move.  The open standard architecture should support this.  <br>    <br>  Performance/Cost: Control and tracking operations while on the move is a critical aspect of today's Tactical SATCOM terminals. Satellite acquisition, open and closed loop tracking, terminal calibration, OTM operations in the tactical environment (shock, vibe, terminal behavior during blockages, and blockage recovery) are all key elements of the architecture and terminal design.    <br>    <br>  Integration: SWAP, EMI/EMC, radiation hazard safety, blockage of firing/sight lines, blockage of LOS to the satellite, vehicle penetrations for cable routing, cable length / loss / durability, and redundancy: single point of failure.  <br>    <br>  PRODUCTS THE ARMY ANTICIPATES DEVELOPING FROM THE OPEN STANDARD ARCHITECTURE  <br>    <br>  From this open standard architecture the intent is to build products with the following attributes:    <br>    <br>  -	Distributed SOTM terminals which are fully functional and independent of all other systems, with exception to the need for vehicle power, a satellite signal (for receive) and a modem.

<DESC>The date for receipt of the SF 330s is hereby changed to 11/1/2013 at 4:00 PM EST.


Question/Answer for Project 534-14-104 DESIGN SERVICES FOR THE UPGRADES, REPAIR, CORRECTION OF ELECTRICAL DEFICIENCIES.

Question:  If the mileage limit cannot be expanded, would we still be considered if we submit our SF330 for the project? In other words, is the 200 mile limit a hard requirement?

Answer:  During construction, VA will need construction period services from the AE.  Considering the fact that we will be working on the electrical system at the medical center, response time is a valid consideration.  Therefore, the 200 miles limit is a requirement.

<p>CAUTION NOTICE -- TWO-PHASE TECHNICAL/PRICE EVALUATION <br />(AUG 2007) DSCP<br />The Government anticipates that numerous offerors will submit proposals on solicitation. In the event that eight or more proposals are received, the Government may use a two-phase evaluation process, which allows the Contracting Officer to conduct a preliminary evaluation of all offers, in order to determine which offers are the least likely to be candidates for further consideration. During this preliminary evaluation, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Certain offerors may be excluded from further consideration at this point, if their PDM ratings and/or offered prices are not competitive when compared with PDM ratings and prices proposed by other offerors. The remaining offers will then be evaluated for the remaining technical evaluation factors. After the completion of this review, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to establish a competitive range and enter into negotiations, or to award without discussions. This process is set forth in provision 52.215-9P23, Two-Phase Technical/Price Evaluation contained in solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit and award on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106 to GFI, Inc. of Harrison, AR. The Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB) of the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, has been tasked by the US Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to evaluate Modified FRP Matting as one of the emerging Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) technologies slated for technology transfer. This system has been flight certified; however, final user evaluations are required to determine what, if any, further system changes are required prior to system acquisition. The purchased mat sets will be used by the ERDC, AFCEC, and the USAF RED HORSE for operational testing, evaluation, and system refinement.  GFI, Inc. is the only company who sells the Modified FRP Matting Sets currently recommended by AFCEC and the ERDC. The Contracting Officer has determined in order to maintain consistency and complete the final user evaluations, the Modified FRP Matting Sets must be purchased from GFI, Inc. These capabilities make GFI, Inc. uniquely suited to provide the need of the required Matting Sets.

<DESC>The chamber upgrade license enables the Spectra T950 Media Storage Unit to access additional chambers already in the device. With the upgrade license, the device is able to store, internally, additional media TeraPack. The chamber Licenses are actually storage upgrades to augment the storage capabilities of our existing T950, and have no other use than to unlock storage space that currently exists within the device. The hardware upgrade will ensure that backup hardware stays current with higher-density tapes, and faster reading/writing tape drives, allowing expansion of capabilities to offer Enterprise-Level backup services and reduce our backup times.

<DESC>Added: Feb 21, 2013 1:04 pm<br />DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of spectrum sharing between radar and communications systems. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary<br />advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.<br /><br />See attached DARPA-BAA-13-24 document for solicitation details.<br /><br />See DARPA Special Notice 13-25 for the Proposer's Day Announcement related to this BAA at the following link:<br /><br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-SN-13-25 /listing.html<br /><br />Added: Mar 13, 2013 10:04 am<br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to publish DARPA-BAA-13-24 Amendment 1 and the Questions and Answers pertaining to the solicitation. Accordingly, see attached files.<br /><br />Added: Sep 06, 2013 9:18 am<br /><br />The contractor shall combine an extensible cognitive control plane with multiple system-level and device-level spectrum separation techniques. The contractor shall demonstrate: 1) scalability through separating global control from multiple local control systems, with the battlespace partitioned intelligently via RF propagation analysis and geospatial reasoning, 2) development and characterization of a range of spectrum sharing techniques leveraging<br />closed-loop information sharing between the radar and communications systems, and 3) high-level management of the cognitive control system by a spectrum sharing priority "dial" the commander can use to rebalance<br />resources to meet evolving mission needs.<br /><br />Add The Following To Description:<br />The contractor shall combine a fully distributed spectrum resource manager application, employing a machine learning control layer, with three innovative spectrum sharing techniques that are carefully chosen to support the transition. A valuable aspect of the project is a strong code-in-the-loop simulation approach leveraging validated models of the radar and military radio transition targets.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit and award on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106 to GFI, Inc. of Harrison, AR. The Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB) of the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, has been tasked by the US Air <br> Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to evaluate Modified FRP Matting as one of the emerging Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) technologies slated for technology transfer. This system has been flight certified; however, final user evaluations are required to determine what, if any, further system changes are required prior to system <br> acquisition. The purchased mat sets will be used by the ERDC, AFCEC, and the USAF RED HORSE for <br> operational testing, evaluation, and system refinement. GFI, Inc. is the only company who sells the Modified FRP Matting Sets currently recommended by AFCEC and the ERDC. The Contracting Officer has determined in order to maintain consistency and complete the final user evaluations, the Modified FRP Matting Sets must be <br> purchased from GFI, Inc. These capabilities make GFI, Inc. uniquely suited to provide the need of the required Matting Sets.

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Troop Support Clothing &amp; Textiles Supply Chain, is the contracting activity.</p>
<p>2. The action being approved is the ability to solicit for DLA requirements on an other than full and open competition basis.</p>
<p>3. Following are the supplies to meet DLA's needs:</p>
<p>Item: Visor, Flyer's Helmet, 55/P<br />NSNs: 8475-01-412-5306 (High Contrast Visor)<br />8475-01-441-9093 (Smoke Colored Visor)<br />Contract Terms: One (1) Year Base Period plus Four (4) One-Year Option Periods<br />Quantity: Base Year 2,438 each (Any Combination of the Two Visors)<br />Four One-Year Option Periods 1,200 each (Any Combination of the Two <br />Visors)<br />Unit Price: $119.58 High Contrast / $136.99 Smoke Colored <br />Maximum Dollar Value, inclusive of options: $1,020,907.06</p>
<p>4. The applicable statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>5. The use of this authority is necessary because Gentex Corporation (Cage Code 97427) is the only known firm that has the capability to manufacture these visors to satisfy the Government's minimum needs for a visor that will provide the aircrew with an enhanced field of vision during varying weather conditions compatible with the Lightweight Flyer's Helmet (HGU 55/P), also manufactured by Gentex. The "high contrast" visor was specially engineered by Gentex for use in snow, haze, overcast, cloudy and foggy conditions to provide aircrew with a heightened and enhanced field of vision when flying in these low-light conditions. The "smoke colored" visor was specially engineered by Gentex for protection against sun glare to allow the aircrew to view the aircraft instrumental panel clearly. The technical data for these items is proprietary to Gentex Corporation and is not available to the Government to develop to permit full and open competition.</p>
<p>6. The proposed procurement was synopsized in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on July 18, 2013. This justification will be posted with the solicitation in accordance with FAR 6.305(c).</p>
<p>7. As the contracting officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on receipt of acceptable certified cost and pricing data.</p>
<p>8. Market Research has found that the required items are not commercial in nature and there are no equivalent products available to meet the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>9. The items to be procured under this acquisition are sole source to Gentex Corporation, as they are custom fit to the 55/P Flyers Helmet, also manufactured by Gentex.</p>
<p>10. No firms other than Gentex Corporation have expressed an interest in the subject requirement.</p>
<p>11. The Contracting Officer will work closely with the engineering activity to develop salient characteristics or a performance-oriented requirements description, with the goal of issuing a Sources Sought Notice within six months of award. This will be a new effort for this item. At a minimum, the Contracting Officer will report progress in this area to the DLA Troop Support Competition Advocate within this six month timeframe. <br /><br />12. As the Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>______________ ___________________________<br />Date</p>
<p><br />I hereby certify that the requirements which form the basis of this justification are accurate, that these supplies meet the Government's needs in accordance with applicable specifications and that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>_______________ ____________________________<br />Date</p>
<p>I have reviewed this justification and recommend approval.</p>
<p><br />_______________ ____________________________<br />Date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />I have reviewed this justification for legal sufficiency.</p>
<p><br />_______________ ____________________________<br />Date</p>
<p><br />I have reviewed and hereby approve this justification.</p>

<DESC>Sole Source Synopsis: The USPFO for Colorado intends to award a modification of currently being executed contract W912LC-11-C-0008 to Mass Service and Supply. The modification will execute the scope of work included in Option Line Items 2 and 3, addition of 64 billets at Ft. Carson, Colorado for the Colorado Regional Training Institute. Magnitude of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. This procurement is being made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Mass Service and Supply possesses the following unique capabilities to perform this work in the most expeditious and cost-efficient manner to the Government. Awarding this additional work to the incumbent contractor eliminates the cost for additional submittal review which has already taken place. There will be no additional scope warranty cost. The incumbent contractor will be able to complete the additional scope concurrent with original scope, thereby saving mobilization costs and duplication of general conditions costs. The incumbent contractor will be able to avoid winter protection costs as they will be able to complete those elements of the additional scope prior to winter onset. The incumbent contractor has full knowledge of and already executed the project scope and is deeply familiar with the project documents, thereby significantly reducing or eliminating change order risk to the government. Any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements. All interested sources must respond not later than 25 October 2013, 11:00 hours MST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contractual modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be emailed to Nicole Jensen at nicole.j.jensen.mil@mail.mil.<br />For any additional details please contact Nicole Jensen @ 720-847-8679.<br />
