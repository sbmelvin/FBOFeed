<DESC>This project entails retrofitting a new backup cooling system into the NOC area of BLDG 165. Additional, as well as backup, cooling is needed for an area that contains a large amount of heat generating equipment. Work will include new HVAC systems and components (cooling and heating), piping, electrical, site work, and finishes, as well as tie-ins to existing equipment. Some manipulation of existing equipment will also be required. New DDC controls will be installed, including integrating these into an already existing DDC system. A backup generator shall be installed for support of the NOC area cooling equipment in the event of a power outage. Cooling will be required throughout the entire project. No temporary shutdowns will be allowed. The project will require the contractor to work in a secure area, with escorts. All work within the NOC area will require specific and precise timing and scheduling, as the area is a controlled access facility. Coordination with the government, especially the occupants of the facility, will be essential. There are areas that do not require work in a secure area. The contractor will supply any and all other incidentals to provide a complete and usable system.
<p>The Request for Proposal will be available on or about 16 May 2014. The Request for Proposal will close on or about 15 Jun 2014. The Performance Period for this project is one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed. The Notice to Proceed will be issued within 10 days after award of the solicitation. This acquisition is open to small business in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The Request for Proposal will be available by Electronic Transmission only at: http://www.fbo.gov. Potential contractors must be currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award. All responsible sources must submit an offer good for 120 days, which shall be considered by the agency. Potential contractors must also be currently registered with SAM. The magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>

19. Mandatory Language: 
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. 
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award. Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). 
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. 
This is a full and open requirement. All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. 
The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation. AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION. For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

20.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-       8116, louis.colon@tinker.af.mil.

<a href="mailto:suzanne.m.drake2.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Edgewood</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Edgewood Contracting Division (ECD), on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), by and through the Joint Product Manager CBRNE Analytics and Response Systems (JPdM CBRNE A&RS) within the Joint Program Manager Guardian (JPMG), intends to competitively solicit proposals, on a full and open basis, for the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) Phase of the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) program.  Specifically, the CALS EMD effort will involve designing, developing, fabricating, integrating, and testing the CALS in multiple configurations in accordance with (IAW) the CALS System Performance Specification (SPS) and this Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The estimated period of performance for the CALS EMD effort is 3.5 years.  The solicitation will contain multiple contract types and options in order to most efficiently execute the CALS EMD effort.  Specifically, all Non-Recurring Engineering, Test Support, Logistics, ect. will be completed on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee basis.  Initial CALS components will be procured via a Firm Fixed Price contract type.  The individual CALS configurations will be procured via Fixed Price Incentive options.  The below provides additional information on CALS and estimated quantities for each configuration. <br>  <br> CALS integrates a common suite of commercial- and government-off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of CBR materials in environmental samples.  The CALS program will develop and field two integrated system configurations to support an array of CBR missions for DoD field analytic units.  Each configuration will support either field confirmation- or theater validation-level environmental CBR analysis.    The configurations will be developed using modular open systems architectures (MOSA), and include: <br>  <br> Field Confirmatory Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 4 each).  Supports tactical decisions in the field regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures.  The system integrates common CBR capabilities into a common 20-foot ISO container. <br>  <br> Analytical Capability Set Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 4 each).   A palletized/transportable configuration.  This transportable configuration enables end users to receive the CBR subsystems that meet their specific mission profiles, while also enabling CBR subsystems to operate in a range of user-provided laboratory enclosures/shelters.  <br>  <br> Theater Validation Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 2 each).  Similar to the Field Confirmatory Configuration, but provides an expanded CBR capability and higher degree of confidence in the analytical results.  Analysis from the Theater Validation Variant provides additional critical information to support timely and effective operational-level decisions regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures.  The system integrates an expanded CBR capability into a set of 20-foot ISO containers. <br>  <br> Interested parties are advised that certain documentation pertaining to the CALS effort is export controlled and as such, access to this documentation will be restricted utilizing the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Interested parties will need valid contractor login credentials to access this information once it has been posted. <br>  <br> The CALS EMD effort will be solicited on a full and open competition basis and will utilize a best value trade-off approach.  It is estimated that solicitation W911SR-14-R-0002 will be issued for the CALS EMD effort no later than 23 May 2014.  <br>  <br> The point of contact for this effort is Ms. Suzanne M. Drake, Contract Specialist.  All inquiries should be directed to suzanne.m.drake2.civ@mail.mil. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted. <br>  <br>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), intends to competitively award a Hybrid type of contract with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) line item for the base period or Phase 1 of the project described below and a Time and Materials (T&M) type line item for Option Period 1 or Phase 2 of the project described below, as a result of this notice.  There are no set aside restrictions.  The BSEE, Acquisition Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resulting contract administration. All potential Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov in order to receive Government awards. The Government anticipated effort for the base period is about 4,200 hours and for Option Period 1 effort to be around 2,400 man-hours. The applicable NAICS Code is 541330, Petroleum Engineering Services. The period of performance of the resultant contract is expected to be 36 months from the date of award.
The BSEE is seeking contractors support for determining and testing of new production from an old field in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region (POCSR). The BSEE analyzed production and development statistics from 1968 through 2013 looking at 14 oil and gas fields encompassing 26 reservoirs. The oil and gas production data showed that rates have been declining for the past 15 years. Production peaked in 1998 at 230,000 barrels per day and by 2013 the production rate had declined to 40,000 barrels per day. 
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 250.1165 require Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) lessees to promptly initiate enhanced oil and gas recovery (EOR) operations for all reservoirs where operations would result in an increase in ultimate recovery of oil or gas under sound engineering and economic principles. We have determined that a study of Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (POCS) sandstone reservoirs wherein these reservoirs are objectively evaluated for EOR opportunities followed by subsequent testing (if appropriate) of one or more of the reservoirs as detailed below has the potential to increase the ultimate recovery of oil and gas on the POCS as well as other areas of the OCS by 5%-40% of stock tank original oil in place (STOOIP) if successful. The study shall be conducted in two phases with the first phase (base period of performance) a reservoir characterization study of POCS sandstone reservoirs and development of a screening methodology. The first phase will prioritize the reservoirs according to likelihood of success based on reservoir characteristics, EOR method, and the economics of applying the EOR technology at the testing stage and into full field implementation. The results will be presented to prioritized operators for participation in the testing phase of the study. The second phase of the study involves the testing, either by core analysis or a pilot test, of the selected reservoir.
Under this effort, the contractor shall conduct a detailed characterization study of POCS sandstone reservoirs in the Beta, Santa Clara, Dos Cuadras, Sockeye, and Carpinteria fields. The contractor will develop a screening tool for EOR applicability for a variety of EOR techniques.  Using the field properties determined in the characterization study and the developed screening tool, the contractor will determine which reservoirs could benefit from EOR implementation, and rank them according to their cost-benefit. If the Option period is exercised, the Contractor shall work with the cooperating operator and BSEE to perform the chosen reservoir/EOR technique(s) test and document the results to the BSEE upon completion.
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If you are interested in participating in this competition, please send your organizations name, business size status under the applicable NAICs code, point of contact, address, telephone number, email address and DUNS Number via email to the Contracting Officer, Sagar S. Damania, Sagar.Damania@bsee.gov at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time April 28, 2014.  The estimated solicitation release date is April 30, 2014.
The Offeror shall reference Solicitation No. E14PS00081 on all correspondence.  Inquiries must be submitted in writing to the email address referenced above.  Telephone inquiries are strongly discouraged. Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.

The Government will be responsible for the transportation costs associated with the movement of the mold to the contractor's place of manufacture.</p>
<p>This requirement will be limited to small business concerns only. The NAICS code and Size Standard are 326199 and 750 employees. The resulting solicitation will: 1) be solicited and negotiated in accordance with FAR part 15, Contracting by Negotiation; and 2) include the provisions and clauses applicable for commercial acquisitions IAW FAR part 12, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses for the Acquisition of Commercial Items. The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Requirements contract to the offeror proposing the lowest price, and whose past performance, currency and relevancy considered, indicates their ability to perform the contract successfully. The period of performance for the resultant contract will include a base year and four 12mo option periods. It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that RFP SP330014R0017 will be posted to this site during the week of 5 May 2014. Amendments to the Request for Proposal will also be posted to this site. Prospective offerors are cautioned concerning their responsibility to access the website for any amendments that may be issued under the solicitation. There will be no advance notification of amendment issuance. NOTE: All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management IAW FAR 52.204-99(Aug 2012)(Deviation) at www.sam.gov or an award cannot be processed.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFACSW) intends to award a contract to one source ( San Diego Gas & Electric Company) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913, which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utility companies to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utility companies) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation.

NOTE:   The solicitation will not be made available on this website.

This notice is provided for information purposes only therefore FAR 5.203 does not apply.
 This opportunity is available only to the utility contractor servicing Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California under a Utilities Energy Service Contract (UESC) N62473-13-G-1409, Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), for the installation, replacement, renovation, repair, operation and maintenance of energy conservation measures and consuming equipment.  Services shall include, but not be limited to, upgrades to Facilities Management Systems (FMS), installation of energy management systems and direct digital controls, implementation of energy conservation measures, and limited Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services for any energy savings devices and technologies installed under any Delivery Order awarded under this BOA at various Navy facilities within the service territory of San Diego Gas and Electric.

Project Description:

The proposed procurement is to provide the following:
1.
   INTERIOR LIGHTING RETROFIT:  This project will replace aging interior lighting infrastructure in five-buildings in NBPL.  The lighting retrofit will replace T-8 fluorescent light fixtures with high-efficiency LED lighting in following buildings:
24 at C3F:		TACTRAGRUPAC
3 at OTC:		COMSPAWARSYSCOM
11 & 52 at NMAWC:	FLEASWTRACENPAC
50 at NMAWC:	EODTEU, DAU, JRIC

The interior lighting retrofit will not be a one-to-one fixture replacement.  The project will install occupancy sensors, time-clocks, and photocells as economically feasible where they are not already installed.

2. EXTERIOR LIGHTING RETROFIT: Included in this project is the replacement of exterior wall packs that have either failed or reached their service life at the following buildings:
C60 at C3F:		HQ/Ops
4 at OTC:		COMSPAWARSYSCOM

Additionally, the lamps illuminating the flag pole in front of OTC-6 (Visitor Reception) will also be replaced with LED lamps.

The CHW plant consists of two chillers, two cooling towers, multiple pumps and other ancillary equipment.  Chiller-1 is variable speed and it has just been overhauled.  Chiller-2 is constant speed and failed several months ago.  This project will replace Chiller-2, two cooling towers, three chilled water pumps, two condenser water pumps, piping, valves and related appurtenances.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Sole Source SAP contract to General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT). The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) Code 34 has been designated by SPAWAR PMW 770 as the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) and the Regional Maintenance Activity (RMC) Depot facility for Multifunctional Antenna Systems which is a mission critical system aboard Navy submarines. The operation of the RMA Depot requires considerable contractor labor and expertise. GDIT is the only Contractor that has the experience and specific factory trained knowledge and expertise to execute the repair and training efforts for the RMA Depot at their current level of operations. Another vendor would not have the experience to immediately step in and perform repair and/or training without a steep learning curve of about 5-6 months causing unacceptable delays and severely impacting the Fleets readiness. These services are essential. The NAICS is 541330; size standard is $35.5 million. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For information on this acquisition please contact Neil Santos at neil.santos@navy.mil

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center - Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (ERDC-CRREL) intends to make a sole source award to Science and Technology Corporation (STC) upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br>   <br> ERDC-CRREL intends to procure the following tasks in support of ongoing Water Resources Geospatial Applications Information Systems Research:  <br>  <br> 1.	Develop New, as well as, Tailor Existing Software for Use in Remote Sensing Environmental Analyses and GIS Research <br> 2.	Develop Software of Geospatial Distributions of Environmental Variables to be used in Wetland and Watershed Studies <br>  <br> These tasks represent a continuation of research performed by STC during the first two years of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contract number W913E5-09-C-0009.  No other source can perform these explicit tasks due to their precise correlation to preceding work performed, and the corresponding data gathered and analyzed, by STC under the BAA.   <br>  <br> In the first task listed above, STC has been the contracting partner for the initial two years of research and development of new remote sensing algorithms using Matlab and ENVI/IDL for improved snow mapping capabilities.  STC provided unique competencies in multispectral extraction of environmental parameters from remotely sensed imagery.  The first two years of work under this task also supported the development of new climate change geographic information system (GIS) visualization tools with specific geospatial analysis expertise.  These skills uniquely qualify STC to perform the third year of this task to finalize R&D and documentation of these methodologies.   <br>  <br> In the second task listed above, the previous two years of effort were focused on research and development of Ordinary High Water (OHW) testing and regional manuals.  STC developed software that produces a statistical model that better describes a plant species' preference for a wetland habitat. The software has been refined over the course of the last two years through continued data collection and analysis.  The methods used by STC are inherent to their knowledge and experience from participation in the wetland plant indicator project. STC's unique methods provide continuity for the refinement of the software, resultant model and field testing. Ultimately, leveraging the previous efforts, methods, and inherent knowledge of STC will result in the successful development of a national manual on OHW that is a logical extension of the regional manuals.   <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement.  Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement for review.  Please provide responses to this notice no later than 28 April 2014 at 12:00 PM CST.  All responses should be sent by e-mail to Tom.F.Nowocin@usace.army.mil or Ashley.M.Jenkins@usace.army.mil. NOTE: Telephone responses will not be accepted. <br>  <br> A determination by the Government not to compete these requirements based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br>  <br>

<a href="mailto:carole.householder@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Pittsburgh</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, has a project that involves the construction of the River Chamber Completion, Monoliths M-22 to M-227 at Charleroi Locks and Dam, Monongahela River, PA.  The major features of the requirement are identified below: <br>  <br> Construction of the River Chamber Completion, Monoliths M-22 to M-27, consists of building steel cofferboxes in order to construct the new reinforced concrete Middle Wall monoliths numbered M-22 to M-27, fabrication and installation of precast concrete culverts within the Middle Wall cofferboxes, relocating the electrical and dam control utilities from the lock side to the dam abutment side including construction of a new elevated platform supporting a new temporary electrical generator, areas of partial and complete removal of the existing river wall and fixed crest weir concrete sections using in-the-wet methods, modifying existing sheet pile structures, removal of a sheet pile structure, stabilization of existing lock walls, instrumentation installation, and instrumentation monitoring.  The work is to be performed using a combination of in-the-wet and in-the-dry construction methods.   The lock wall monoliths will be built using a combination of tremie concrete and cast-in-place concrete within a cofferbox.  The precast concrete culverts are three sided culverts and are to be fabricated off site at a commercial precast fabrication facility.  Onsite fabrication of the precast concrete culvert will not be permitted.  The M-22 to M-27 New Middle Wall section is approximately 260 feet by 35 feet in plan and is located riverward of the downstream end of the existing Middle Wall for the land lock chamber.  Construction of the lock wall involves underwater excavation of both soil and rock; heavy lifting and placement of the precast culverts from a floating plant; sheet piles, king piles and associated steel waler and strut installation for cofferbox construction from a floating plant; drilled shaft foundations; as well as operation and maintenance of the Government owned Concrete Batch Plant, concrete delivery system, and ancillary items.  Maintenance of the batch plant will include repair and/or replacement of various items necessary for continued operation of the plant.   <br>  <br> Disposal of suitable excavated materials and concrete rubble without embedded ferrous material will be required.  The offloading area at Victory Hollow (VH), approximately 7 miles downstream of Charleroi Locks and Dam, will be utilized to stockpile and dispose of the suitable materials from the construction activities.  Ferrous and other construction waste material will be disposed at a commercially permitted facility licensed to accept the waste or recycled if applicable. <br>  <br> Construction work will occur in close proximity to waterway traffic.  The existing landside lock chamber is currently operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Maintaining unimpeded access (to the extent possible under this contract) of this facility to waterway traffic and maintaining stability of the existing middle wall are underlying goals of this contract.  <br>  <br> Environmental protection will include requirements to remain in compliance with the existing NPDES permitting at both VH and the Concrete Batch Plant. <br>  <br> The magnitude of the project is between $25,000 and $100,000.  This procurement will be advertised on an Unrestricted basis.  The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued approximately May 27, 2014 online only through the Federal Business Opportunities website; therefore, requests for hardcopies of the specifications and drawings will not be honored.   <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC><p>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing preparing and administering payments to research volunteers and be knowledgeable about the issues associated with payment of said volunteers.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research Branch (PECRB) conducts research<br />related to Type 2 diabetes and its complications. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) supports and conducts research to increase our understanding of these diseases and to develop improved means of prevention; diagnosis, and treatment. Many of the diseases of interest to NIDDK are more common among American Indians than in the general U.S. population. The NIDDK's research activities are dependent upon e participation of American Indian Volunteers (and a smaller number of non-Indian volunteers) in approved medical research studies <br />Conducted at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center and the Hu Hu Kam Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>PECRB has permanent research facilities in two locations: (1) at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) in Phoenix, Arizona; and (2) at the Guadalupe Clinic in the township of Guadalupe to conduct research related to Type 2 diabetes and its complications among American and Yaqui Indians respectively. For example, greater than fifty percent (50%) of adult Pima Indians and more than twenty percent (20%) of adults in many other tribes have diabetes. Therefore, the NIDDK's Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch was established to study this high-risk<br />population.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall have knowledge of preparing and administering payments to research volunteers and be knowledgeable about the issues associated with payment of said volunteers. The Contractor shall support the participation of American Indians and non-Indians who volunteer for approved medical research projects conducted by the NlDDK. The Contractor shall be responsible for paying these individuals, including writing and issuing checks, maintaining payment files, and satisfying the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to reporting earned income.</p>
<p>The services of a contractor are required to facilitate the participation of the volunteers.&nbsp; Experience has shown that prompt payment to volunteer study participants is essential for both the recruitment and retention of volunteers as study participants. Consequently, on-site payment to volunteers on the day of hospital discharge or at the completion of outpatient studies is a requirement of the contract. It is also essential that the contractor maintain a bank account with a financial institution represented in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area for the purpose of issuing payment checks.</p>
<p>All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, should include references. One copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than 10 days prior to close of business (11:00 A.M. local time at designated location) on April 21, 2014.</p>
<p>For questions regarding Solicitation number <strong>NIHLM2014131</strong> please send via email to griffinv@mail.nih.gov. <br /><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provided feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate response to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality - No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s)."</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) [formerly CCR].&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sam.gov">http://www.sam.gov</a></p>

<DESC>This market survey is for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  This is not a solicitation for proposals.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this market survey.   <br>   <br> After review of the information provided below, the Government is soliciting comments/responses to the following topics from interested vendors.  1) Interest in the solicitation based on the maximum contract amount; 2) Design after award requirements; 3) Bonding capability for the maximum task order amount of 2,000,000,000 Japanese Yen; 4) Any barriers that will prevent or discourage your firm from participating in the solicitation; 5) Other comments or information you wish to provide; 6) Your firm's capability to perform task order work anticipated.  If you do not have any comment on a particular topic, please indicate so.  An Excel sheet is attached for your use.  Please send your comments/responses via e-mail to takashi.horiuchi.ln@usace.army.mil and sean.p.sackett.civ@usace.army.mil by April 25, 2014, 09:00 AM (Japan Standard Time).   <br>   <br> 1. The U.S. Army Engineer District-Japan is planning to solicit a MATOC for D-B and D-B-B construction to support U.S. Government facilities in the prefecture of Okinawa.  Any solicitations pursued are intended for local sources only.  Local sources are those sources physically located and licensed to conduct business in Japan.  A MATOC is an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for construction services with multiple awardees.  Actual work is awarded through the issuance of task orders.  Multiple awardees generally complete with each other for task orders.   <br>   <br> 2. The Government is seeking experienced sources capable of performing a wide range of D-B and D-B-B construction projects involving water lines, sewer lines, paving, painting, roofing, renovation of interiors of existing buildings, new building construction, structural construction, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and components, refrigeration systems, fire suppression systems, fuel pipeline and storage systems, distribution and utilization systems (including lightning), power generators and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS), public address systems, fire alarm systems, telephone systems, asbestos, lead based paint, and petroleum-contaminated material abatement and disposal.   <br>   <br> 3. Each MATOC will consist of a one-year base period and three (3) one-year option periods.  The total maximum amount for all the contracts combined will be 4,200,000,000 Japanese yen.  Each awarded contract will have a 500,000 Japanese yen guaranteed minimum on the base period; options will have no guaranteed minimum.  The Government is not obligated to exercise the option periods.  A performance bond will be required for individual task orders over 12,750,000 Japanese yen.  The minimum task order amount is 100,000 Japanese yen.  The maximum task order amount is 2,000,000,000 Japanese yen.   <br>   <br> 4. Task order issued under these contracts will be D-B or D-B-B in nature.  For D-B-B task orders, the Government will provide the contractor with full design.  For D-B task orders, the contractor may be required to produce engineering designs ranging from shop-drawings to full designs in accordance with the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS) depending on the complexity of the task order.  The Government will provide the contractor with a project scope varying from a general scope of work with no drawings to a complete statement of work with design up to 90 percent.  Contractor design will be conducted after award of a task order in accordance with both U.S. and Japanese design standards.  The contractor will be required to provide licensed professional designers having qualifications that meet contract requirements.  <br>   <br> 5. Responsibility of the Contractor for Design (USACE Acquisition Instruction (UAI) clause 52.236-5004).  (a) The Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other non-construction services furnished by the Contractor under this contract. The Contractor shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiency in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other non-construction services and perform any necessary rework or modifications, including any damage to real or personal property, resulting from the design error or omission.  (b) The standard of care for all design services performed under this agreement shall be the care and skill ordinarily used by members of the architectural or engineering professions practicing under similar conditions at the same time and locality.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the contract specifies that portions of the Work be performed in accordance with a performance standard, the design services shall be performed so as to achieve such standards.  (c) Neither the Government's review, approval or acceptance of, nor payment for, the services required under this contact, shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any rights under this contract or of any cause of action arising out of the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall be and remain liable to the Government in accordance with applicable law for all damages to the Government caused by the Contractor's negligent performance of any of these services furnished under this contract.  (d) The rights and remedies of the Government provided for under this contract are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law. (e) If the Contractor is comprised of more than one legal entity, each entity shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder.

<DESC>NAICS Code: <br> 221122 Electric Power Distribution <br> 221210 Natural Gas Distribution <br> 221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems <br>  <br> 1. Contract Information: The US Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) energy management project for the US Army Fort Bragg, North Carolina, USA. <br>  <br> 2. Background: 10 USC 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities.  42 USC 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below. <br>  <br>   - Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities. <br>  <br>   - Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand. <br>  <br>   - Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency. <br>  <br>   - If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives. <br>  <br> 3. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.  <br>  <br> 4. Project Information:  The requirement at the US Army Fort Bragg North Carolina includes but is not limited to purchase and installation of a 2MW combined heat and power system featuring a natural gas fired reciprocating engine generator; water jacket and exhaust system heat exchanges to capture and reuse waste heat; providing a 1.2 mile natural gas line to connect to the Fort Bragg natural gas system; configure the USASOC Training Complex into a microgrid; conversion of all fuel oil boilers to natural gas; installation of switchgears. <br>  <br> 5. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

The database contains all of the qualified, interested AE firms that respond to this notice for consideration for future approved projects falling within the NAICS codes indicated. Examples of some of the types of work include, but is not limited to; low volume design, design of small warehouses and offices, design of building renovations, historic preservation, rehabs to improved energy efficiency and safety concerns, energy audits and studies, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, LEED consulting, design of HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, construction inspection, construction period services, asbestos investigations, mapping services, drafting services, surveying (construction and property), geotechnical investigation, and environmental investigations, reviews, inventories, and audits.
There are no known projects at this time.  We are establishing our pool of qualified, interested AE firms so that as projects are identified and funding is available we are positioned to utilize the short selection process to relatively quickly and efficiently obtain AE services.
WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?
The Short Selection Process utilizes the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-5.
For AE projects with an estimated total fee under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, $150,000, agencies may review current data files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project. A price proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. A-E data files will be maintained by Geographic Location, Small Business Program and NAICS code. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.
Currently, as required by VAAR 819.7004, VA Contracting Order of Priority, the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisitions for AE procurements in all NAICS Codes herein, shall be the following:  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), including but not limited to SDVOSBs, Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act businesses or The Historically-Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program and any other Small Business Contracting Programs.  As such for AE projects with an estimated fee of under $150,000.00, VA will first review SDVOSBs, than VOSBs, than 8(a) or HUBZone, than all other Small Business Contracting Program data files within the Geographic Location of the Project and Applicable NAICS Code to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project.

Access from the parking garage to the main entrance will be either from a ramped Handicap accessible sidewalk from the west side of the garage next to the stairs or from the drive openings to access the non-handicap accessible north exterior sidewalk along the parking structure.
The parking structure is designed as an open parking garage per the 2012 IBC and the VA Parking Design Manual and is to be constructed utilizing precast concrete 12' double tees with field applied 3" concrete topping, precast beams, walls and columns. The configuration of the parking in the garage allows for ninety degree parking throughout the garage and is designed in a two-bay configuration. The parking structure will be supported by straight shaft drilled concrete piers that extend to limestone bedrock approximately 25 ft. below grade.
The affected existing light poles in the surface parking lot will be removed and relocated to allow for the new structure. Lighting within the structure will be LED fixtures both on each level and at the roof parking area in the Base Bid.

These will be accessible from each level and will have a glass wall on the cab that is viewable from the North side of the elevators from ground level to the roof. There will be a small overhang over the entrance to the elevator at the roof level to provide limited protection from the elements while waiting for
the elevator. Each level of the elevator will be color coded at the walls and doors with the level designation indicated. An elevator control room will be provided at the east end of the elevator shaft on the first floor level within the parking structure.
There are two stair towers for the parking structure. One will be at the northeast corner of the structure.

This includes the parking of vehicles that have been modified for disabled drivers and passengers.

The hours of operation will be between 7:00 am - 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, excluding all Federal holidays. Contractor staffing will be adjusted based on peak periods. The valet and high density parking operations will be staffed with as many employees necessary to ensure an efficient and timely operation. The contractor shall ensure there are no unreasonably long delays, traffic back-ups, or unsafe practices blocking an emergency right of way.  Tipping is not permitted and will be strictly enforced.   "No Tipping" signs shall be provided by the Contractor.  Contractor shall maintain insurance coverage to cover any damage to vehicles, coordinate the damage claim directly with the customer, and notify COR of any claims filed.

All parking attendants must possess a valid/current driver's license. The contractor is required to provide a certified copy of driver's license history issued by a state's Department of Public Safety. The contractor shall also provide attendants that are trained to operate handicapped vehicles. All employees must understand and speak fluent English. 

The contractor shall furnish and install all signs needed for operations (signage to be approved by VA), furnish claim checks, check-in stations (booths) phones or two-way radios or other miscellaneous items necessary to facilitate valet parking operations.  The VA will provide a suitable location for the booth(s) and electric power at no charge.  Signs shall be easy to read and look professional. Hand-written signs are not allowed. The contractor shall provide uniforms to all personnel working under this contract. Uniforms shall facilitate easy identification of contractor staff by employee name and company name. Uniform type will be agreed upon with VA and contractor at the pre-work meeting. Uniforms shall be worn at all times during performance of contract duties.

<DESC>The USDA National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA, intends to award a procurement of 31 Bison heifers to Timber Ridge Bison. This animal procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106 and 6.303-2. The purchase determination is based on previous vaccine experiments that have utilized bison obtained from this source. Obtaining bison from a different source may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiences that may lead to increased variability in immune responses and impair comparison of vaccine responses across experiments. This herd has been verified free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), a significant cause of mortality in many bison herds. Currently available diagnostics lack the sensitivity and specificity to detect infected herds or individuals. Purchase of bison with MCF would make all data from the proposed experiment invalid and non-publishable. Of equal concern would be the possibility that MCF could be inadvertently introduced into bison in other experiments (i.e. deer) at NADC; a scenario that would be devastating to several ongoing brucellosis, tuberculosis and possibly prior research projects. Least cost procurement of bison on a previous occasion did result in procurement of MCF-positive bison. This vendor maintains our bison genetic needs at an agreeable travel distance. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $40,325.00.
<p>This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide the required animals. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to lara.j.hicok@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 12:00 pm central time, December 27, 2013.</p>

<CONTACT>Ernest Dixon III, (919) 549-4270

<a href="mailto:ernie.dixon@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - RTP</a>
<DESC>The ACC-APG, RTP Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is exploring the possibility of entering into a Partnership Intermediary Agreement (PIA), under the authority of 15 U.S.C. 3715, with a Partnership Intermediary to provide services for ARL to increase the likelihood of success in the conduct of cooperative or joint activities with ARL and small business firms, institutions of higher education as defined in 20 USC 1141(a) , or educational institutions as defined in 10 USC 2194.   This is a Request for Information (RFI) from eligible applicants who can provide the capabilities sought by ARL as described in this RFI. <br>  <br> RFI Applicability:  In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 3715, eligibility to receive a PIA is limited to an agency of a State or local government, or a nonprofit entity owned in whole or in part by, chartered by, funded in whole or in part by, or operated in whole or in part by or on behalf of a State or local government, that assists, counsels, advises, evaluates, or otherwise cooperates with small business firms, institutions of higher education as defined in section 1141(a) of title 20, or educational institutions within the meaning of section 2194 of title 10, that need or can make demonstrably productive use of technology-related assistance from a Federal laboratory, including State programs receiving funds under cooperative agreements entered into under section 5121(b) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 278l).  <br>  <br> RFI submission and post submission guidelines:  Documents submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. ARL is under no obligation to provide feedback with respect to any information submitted by an eligible applicant under this RFI. There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in the establishment of a PIA with an eligible applicant.  Any information submitted by an eligible applicant in response to this RFI may be used to help ARL further define its PIA needs.   ARL may select a Partnership Intermediary based solely on an RFI submission.  ARL may discuss the RFI submissions with one or more eligible applicants prior to the selection of a Partnership Intermediary.    <br>  <br> 3.  General Intent: <br>  <br> ARL is interested in creating a more efficient and effective defense laboratory that can be adaptive and responsive to the challenges of 21st century national security.  It is widely acknowledged that innovation depends on bringing multiple disciplines together to engage in collaborative projects that often yield unpredictable, but highly productive results. Formal and informal interactions among scientists lead to knowledge-building and research breakthroughs.  By bringing together academia, industry and government, the Army can enhance its performance through collocated R&D collaboration.  ARL is exploring the establishment of a PIA with a Partnership Intermediary to provide services to assist ARL in facilitating access to world-renown facilities and researchers; developing and maintaining synergistic relationships with the entrepreneur community; facilitating government partnerships to facilitate the transition of knowledge and technology; and expansion of academic programs to include fluid collaboration spaces (physical and virtual). <br>  <br> 4. Description:  <br>  <br> The speed, complexity, and multidisciplinary nature of scientific research, coupled with the increased relevance of science for army technology development and the demands of a globally competitive environment, have increased the importance of technology linkages for innovation and long-term competitiveness.   ARL is implementing an Open Campus Concept (OCC) that will revolutionize the way ARL laboratories engage with external partners from industry and academia.  The OCC seeks to enhance meaningful progress toward shared goals: accelerate fundamental science, and transition science and technology as a direct result of the cooperative or joint activities as envisioned under 15 USC 3715. Others benefits of the OCC include shared human capital, shared facilities, and exposure to new ideas and collaboration hubs which could lead to joint programs and/or preparing joint proposals between academia, private sector, and international partners.  The three primary focus areas in the implementation phase of the OCC are identifying areas of opportunities for collaboration, technology transfer and educational outreach.  This RFI seeks input into these areas of interest where services could be provided to assist ARL in achieving its goals of a fully open campus.   <br> In response to this RFI, interested eligible applicants are requested to provide strategies and explicit examples of how they propose to facilitate and advance ARL's initiatives in collaboration, technology transfer, and outreach as described further below.  <br> ARL Initiative 1: Collaboration: <br> The Partnership Intermediary is expected to enhance partnering, both domestic and international, between ARL, academia, industry, other government agencies and entrepreneurs by identifying and facilitating the development of new R&D partnerships and stimulating early-stage partnership R&D activities.  The Partnership Intermediary is expected to be well versed in the ARL technology campaign portfolio as well as technology portfolios of proposed partners to facilitate match-making services that leverage the complementary capabilities and expertise of ARL and each partner.  The Partnership Intermediary is expected to identify and shape opportunities to share / develop collaborative research facilities at either ARL or a partner organization.  The Partnership Intermediary shall increase ARL's visibility in online research communities via data hubs, blogs and other web strategies as part of ARL's collaboration and technology transfer plan.  The Partnership Intermediary is expected to facilitate opportunities for collaboration through the exchange of personnel / students, licensing of intellectual property (IP), and sharing and development of research facilities through vehicles such as educational partnership agreements (EPAs), cooperative R&D agreements (CRADAs), and cooperative agreements (CAs).   <br> Events targeted to facilitate collaboration may include: <br>  <br>  	Engage in matchmaking sessions, enabling ARL to network with potential R&D partners.  <br>  	Conduct or participate in workshops and roundtables to explore novel models of collaboration that enable ARL to identify new opportunities addressing shared challenges. <br>  	Gather, data mine and exchange information on relevant international and domestic R&D and business opportunities and promote innovation interests.  <br>  <br> ARL Initiative 2:  Technology Transfer: <br> Emerging cooperative relationships often lead to the initiation of collaborative R&D projects, business partnerships and joint ventures that benefit both organizations. The Partnership Intermediary is expected to be knowledgeable of all aspects of the technology transfer process between ARL, academia, industry, other government agencies, and entrepreneurs.  The Partnership Intermediary is expected to identify external partners to facilitate the use of ARL IP with partners through vehicles such as CRADAs, CAs, and patent license agreements (PLAs).  The Partnership Intermediary is expected to develop strategies to create and incubate small business start up opportunities.  Intermediary should identify opportunities for ARL to collaborate with partners using ARL IP inventory and ARL unique testing facilities/capabilities.    <br>  <br> Events targeted to enhance technology transfer may include: <br>  <br>  	Conduct of a Technology Showcase to highlight research ripe for transition. <br>  	Participation in regional and national technology transfer symposia and conferences to identify partners for transfer.  <br>  <br> ARL Initiative 3:  Education Outreach: <br> Recent years have seen an increasing need for lifelong learning based on the acceleration of technological change and the need to renew the skills and knowledge of the existing workforce.  ARL is committed to fostering and strengthening a culture of innovation. We wish to engage the ranks of the highly skilled S&T community and facilitate the cross-fertilization of ideas and learning. The Partnership Intermediary is expected to seek out opportunities to identify academic partners that wish to engage with ARL on specific research areas of interest or in emerging areas with high potential payoff for the Army.  The Partnership Intermediary is also expected to identify any virtual classrooms, data warehouse or educational laboratories which ARL may augment in pursuit of STEM national readiness. <br> Events targeted to enhance outreach may include: <br>  	Identify visiting faculty from academia for research opportunities at ARL or identify positions for ARL researchers as Professors of Practice, Adjunct Professors, or Visiting Researchers in academia.   <br>  	Identify opportunities to attract undergraduates and post graduate level students and faculty from top tier universities to conduct research at ARL.   <br>  	Identify opportunities for the ARL workforce to expand education opportunities and earn advanced degrees at partner universities.  <br>  	Engage with partner universities and plan for ARL on-site technical education /curriculum leading to advanced degrees. <br>  	Based on emerging research areas and Army requirements, shape or develop nontraditional curriculums to develop the next generation of engineers and scientists. <br>  <br> 5.

<DESC>Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration anticipates awarding two or more Full-Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for architect-engineer (A-E) services. Projects will primarily involve improvements to rural low-volume roadways in environmentally sensitive areas requiring context sensitive design solutions for work ranging from pavement preservation, to 3R (resurfacing, restoration and rehabilitation) to full reconstruction. Transportation-related engineering and surveying services will include all work needed to conduct planning, scoping, environmental compliance, preliminary and final design to prepare contract documents in support of several Federally-funded programs administered by CFLHD.
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACT: This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis to A-E firms licensed and registered within one or more of the states served by CFLHD. Professional documents produced under each contract will require a Professional Engineer and/or a Registered Land Surveyor license relative to the state in which the project work is located. Each contract awarded will consist of 1 base year and options to extend the contract for 4 additional 1-year periods. Each successful A-E firm will be re-evaluated each year to determine award of options to extend the contract. The contract shall have a maximum not-to-exceed 5-year total of $10 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated, firm-fixed price task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders may or may not be for a complete project or series of projects.</p>

<DESC>Title: RQ-20A PUMA All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Moving Target Indicator (MTI)
<p>1. This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This RFI is for market research and is issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation or commitment on the part of the U.S. Government (USG) to issue a solicitation or to award a contract now or in the future. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this special notice. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary. Participants will not receive payment any submittals. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, responses will be treated as information only.</p>
<p>2. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. Responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only.</p>
<p>3. United States Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting market research which will be used to plan and implement an acquisition strategy to procure a Moving Target Indicator Tracking (MTI) capability. User objectives for a MTI capability as described in Paragraph 4 of this RFI. Your submission should include cost, schedule, a technical description on how you intend to meet the objectives and what camera would be available for a flight evaluation in mid-2014. For those objectives not met, provide a description of how they would be met. Information of the details of the flight evaluation will be provided at a later date in a separate notice.</p>
<p>4. The USG has particular interest in production ready systems (i.e., minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 as defined by the Department of Defense (DOD) Acquisition Guidebook (August 5, 2010) and a minimum Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 7 as defined by the DOD Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Deskbook (May 2, 2009). The system needs to meet and/or exceed the following objectives:</p>
<p>a) Sense motion and indicate moving objects against a static background, low contrast background, and high contrast background. Objects of interest range from small animal size (small dog) to large vehicles. Detect and indicate to the operator an object of interest moving, while stationary (e.g. moving arms, a turret or gun in a truck swiveling), slow moving contacts (sniper creeping through high grass), and fast moving contacts (speeding truck off in the distance), in both Electro-optical (EO) and Infra-Red (IR) camera modes (T)</p>
<p>b) Sense and indicate moving targets that are camouflaged and / or otherwise visually disrupted to limited naked eye detection against a variety of low contrast tactical background environments to include forest, grasslands, jungle foliage, arctic, desert, blue water maritime, green/brown water maritime, urban/concrete/asphalt, shipboard/industrial</p>
<p>c) Provide an identification method for multiple identified contacts, and a methodology/capability to identify multiple targets in the camera's field of view on both land and water (T)</p>
<p>d) Retain identification of a target if it returns into the FOV after departing without the requirement to re-assign a new identification (O)</p>
<p>e) Identify and maintain identification of an identified moving contact once movement has stopped, then re-started movement. Maintain a reliable indication as the target changes aspect relative to the SUAS.</p>
<p>f) Hardware solution weight is not more than 0.5 lbs and power draw of not more than 5 watts continuous (T). If capability is software only solution, it must run on the existing RQ-20A laptop computer/GCS interface and not impede FMV being down liked or displayed.</p>
<p>g) Provide a target history trail (operator can vary the history length) to indicate identified tiems)' path, velocity, and predicable direction even through obscured visibility</p>
<p>h) Ability to maintain/re-acquire a indentification using predictive analysis when an indentification history is broken due to loss of line of sight when the identified object passes under, behind, or is otherwise momentarily obscured from observation/identification</p>
<p>Notes:<br />1Mission Altitude - Determined by the payload/sensor and aircraft combination to achieve the required visual and acoustic signatures with required NIIRS value.<br />2Operational Environment - Any environmental conditions in which the aircraft/system may be employed throughout the full spectrum of military operations (dust, rain, snow, winds, etc.) with limited hangar/shelter capacity.</p>
<p>5. In particular, the Government is interested in the following information to be provided in your response:</p>
<p>a) Describe the capability your system can provide in relation to the objectives in paragraph 5. Provide a technical description of the UAS MTI to include details of the modularity, subsystems, open systems architecture, and future growth capability. Also describe your training concept and training equipment required to operate the MTI.</p>
<p>b) Include a discussion of any USG requirement that you believe are incompatible, unachievable or significant cost drivers (possibly unaffordable) and the rationale.</p>
<p>c) Responses should also address vendor requirements/concerns for their participation in a potential future demonstration to include any safety concerns/considerations, facility requirements, frequency requirements, electrical power requirements, fuel requirements, etc.</p>
<p>d) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate broken down by MTI components and training in quantities showing economies of scale.</p>
<p>e) How modifications would/could be accomplished--production line incorporation or as post-production modifications.</p>
<p>6. Responses to this RFI shall be limited to 15 pages in length not including the cover page or exhibits (including pictures within the text). Provide a quad chart, providing an overview of your system does not count toward the page count.</p>
<p>Classified information, if required, will be provided in a separate annex and shall be handled, labeled, and stored in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Operating Manual.</p>
<p>Responses should be e-mailed to the POCs listed below. Paper copies of the paper submittal will also be accepted.</p>
<p>If the response contains proprietary sensitive material, paper copies must be clearly labeled "Proprietary Sensitive Material". Proprietary sensitive material will be protected from disclosure.</p>
<p>When appropriate, non-Government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with Procurement Integrity Laws and shall sign non-disclosure and rules of conduct/conflict of interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submissions in response to this RFI constitute approval to release the submittal to Government support contractors.</p>

ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) - The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned.

GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)<br />a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled<br />(i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and <br />(ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to<br />exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.<br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this<br />contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.<br />10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph<br />(a)(2) below); or (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a) (2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not<br />constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Notwithstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the<br />drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or re-performance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the<br />Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.<br />15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof.

If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.<br />18.

If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to<br />(i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.<br />19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract.

DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)<br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers.

As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date.

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.<br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, at 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Central Venous Catheters will be established approximately September 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately October 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Central Venous Catheters. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Central Venous Catheters.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Central Venous Catheters. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $899,217.06. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. The Central Venous Catheter products represent seventy-nine distinct product groupings, of which seventy-nine are clinically significant. Five of those are requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 56.98% ($512,384.49) of the total volume in sales ($899,217.06). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Central Venous Catheters requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Chest Tube Drainage Systems. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Chest Tube Drainage Systems products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Chest Tube Drainage Systems. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Chest Tube Drainage Systems will be established approximately September 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately October 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Chest Tube Drainage Systems. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Chest Tube Drainage Systems.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Chest Tube Drainage Systems. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $411,934.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eight product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the eight product groups, two represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Both of the items are considered the requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 93.60% ($385,591.00) of the total volume in sales ($411,934.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B.

Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs.

<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <p> This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The contractor shall research, collect documents, create an archival collection suitable for immediate transfer to NASA upon completion, conduct oral histories, and prepare several historical products on this subject suitable for a general audience but adhering to accepted standards of historical scholarship. <p> CONTRACTOR PRODUCTS/DELIVERABLES: This project shall result in the following major categories of products: <p> 1. Archivesthe contractor shall collect, organize, and maintain for use by NASA management and other researchers a collection of historically significant key documents that will become a permanent record of the actions of the program. This material shall serve as a basis for the preparation of the historical products discussed below and upon completion shall be made a part of the permanent record of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This collection of key documentary sources, especially private papers and those not a part of the federal records management system, and their placement in a single government repository is a critical component of this effort. These materials will become useful in providing essential information for present-day historians, the interested public, and present-day policy makers, as well as for future generations of individuals interested in the subject. Resources necessary to maintain the archives will be provided by the contractor. The major tasks of this aspect of the work include: <p> 	Archival Preservation: Contractor shall search for, accession, preserve, and make available historically significant documents and electronic materials associated with the origins and conduct of this facility. This requires the responsibility, first and foremost, for providing physical and intellectual control over the holdings of this special collection. It also requires responsibility for ensuring coherency of the collection, maintaining ready access for researchers, and providing research services to senior NASA officials and Federal executives. This collection includes documents, schematicws, drawings, still photographs, motion pictures, and videos. <p> 	Finding Aids: Contractor shall inventory and index file folders, reports, and publications (books) in this collection. The contractor shall also be responsible for imaging key documents in the collection into an archival retrieval system for permanent preservation. <p> 	Reference: Contractor shall respond to reference inquiries and preparing publicly releasable documents describing the conduct of the program. Reference inquiries may be made by letter, telephone, or in person. <p> 2.	Oral historiesthe contractor shall conduct interviews with key personnel involved in the HST program. These shall provide honest, first-hand accounts of the development of the discipline and NASAs role in it. All oral histories shall be transcribed, edited, and made available after a release has been signed by the interviewee in keeping with the standard practices of oral historians. These materials shall also become available to provide essential information for present-day historians, the interested public, and policy makers, as well as for future generations of individuals interested in the subject. At least 25 percent of all oral histories shall be conducted on digital video and or other appropriate  medium so that portions of them may be used for television, World Wide Web, or CD/ROM  or DVD productions. <p> 3. Images for the manuscript shall be delivered in full-size high-resolution (300 dpi scan at a minimum of 5 wide or comparable resolution at original size) graphics files in JPEG or PNG file formats. These images are to be delivered as separate files, not integrated into the electronic manuscript files. Directions on how to indicate the placement of images in the manuscript are included in the NASA History Program Style Guide. The contractor shall be responsible for collecting appropriate images and obtaining the relevant permission to use them. Permissions are to be documented on release forms from the appropriate person or organization and will be submitted along with the graphics files. All NASA images will be identified by NASA image number. Print versions of the work will only contain a limited number of black and white images. Electronic versions may be illustrated more completely in full color. Therefore, the contractor shall provide color images when available, and the contractor is encouraged to provide supplemental images and audio/video files that might be used in electronic versions of the work. <p> 4. Multimedia workscontractor shall provide input to GSFC and others who will be producing multimedia documentaries to disseminate historical knowledge about the program conducted in it through the following potential means: <p> 	World Wide Web page on the history of HST. <p> 	CD/ROM or other medium decided on containing oral histories of key personnel involved in the evolution of the HST program. <p> 	CD/ROM or other medium decided on containing key documents about the program. <p> 5.

This will be the last deliverable in the contract. This volume should begin with an introduction that explains the purpose and scope of the book as well as its contents, describes the method of research and the parameters of study, and presents in an introductory manner the major themes considered in the work. The book should be organized chronologically, with each chapter developing major themes in the history of the subject. All writing should be in accordance with acceptable scholarly, literary, and methodological standards as established by the NASA History Office and reflected in earlier NASA history publications and the NASA style guide. Reference notes in this narrative should appear in proper academic style as established in the above and in the Chicago Manual of Style.

THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS
<p>Solicitation number NB686010-14-01577 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). <br />This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-72.</p>
<p>Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. They must be received no later than seven calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.<br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516, and the Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is soliciting from all interested Small Business parties who can provide a 10Kilowat Laser Workstation for Laser materials processing, in the Time and Frequency Division, as outlined in this solicitation, located at NIST in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p>NIST is a world leader in calibration services to support lasers and laser-related processes. A key to the success of this program is access to high power laser sources. Currently, NIST has a 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser. To meet the needs of its customers, NIST is undertaking an ambitious program to understand the fundamental laser-material processes that occur during laser welding. To meet these needs, NIST needs a laser workstation that integrates its existing 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser with an industrial laser welding held with high-accuracy three-dimensional motion control within a Class 1 laser enclosure. The output laser power must be tunable over the range from 20 % to 100 % of maximum output power. Laser beam divergence must be less than 2 mrad over a minimum distance of 5 m. In addition, the laser source must be capable of operation in both continuous wave mode as well as modulated mode with a pulse repetition frequency up to 15 kHz or greater to take full advantage of the dynamic range of the laser power standards in the Laser Radiometry Project. The only known commercial technology for meeting these requirements is high power fiber laser technology. <br />The system shall meet or exceed the following technical specifications:<br />NIST requires a 10 Kilowatt laser workstation to support metrology for laser materials processing. This workstation is a critical part of an ongoing research program in laser materials processing. We require a workstation that is capable of both production and prototype use. We require a vendor who has the technical expertise to provide ongoing support of this tool for our research program with the ability to perform modifications to the workstation at a later date. In addition, the vendor must be able to show they have the technical expertise to accommodate future modifications to the laser workstation that are not currently available. At this time, IPG Photonics is the only known vendor that meets all of the technical specifications and has the technical expertise to accommodate future modifications to the laser workstation that are currently available. Furthermore, IPG Photonics is the only known vendor who can integrate our existing fiber laser (model number 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13) with the laser welding head without violating the warranty on our existing fiber laser. NIST has undertaken a significant market research effort in search of a 10 kilowatt laser workstation. Based on that research, IPG Photonics was the only company determined to be capable of performing the integration of the laser welding head and existing NIST fiber laser without violating the warranty on the NIST fiber laser.<br />1. Existing Commercial Products:<br />Equipment shall be a current year production model and not a prototype or one-of-a-kind system. There shall be at least 10 working units similar to the proposed make and model operating currently in the field. This workstation is a critical part of an ongoing research program in laser materials processing. We require a workstation that is capable of both production and prototype use. We require a vendor who has the technical expertise to provide ongoing support of this tool for our research program with the ability to perform modifications to the workstation at a later date. In addition, the vendor must be able to show they have the technical expertise to accommodate future modifications to the laser workstation that are not currently available. Any substitutions of normally used major system components, such as power-supplies, coolers, and optics equipment required to meet these specifications shall be clearly noted in the proposal. The offeror's response shall identify specifically the number of tools of the same make and model to the one proposed which have been delivered in the prior 18 months.<br />2. Physical Specifications:<br />Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) 10 Kilowatt Laser Workstation for Laser Materials Processing. The quoted system/solution must meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein.<br />Footprint and installation environment and testing:<br />All equipment, excluding the rough vacuum pumps, chillers, electronics and ancillary equipment not requiring operator access, shall be required to fit on a 9foot high by 6 foot wide by 7 foot deep volume so that it will fit into our lab with existing equipment. Bid responses must include system dimensions and required clearances. Requirements for house facilities, such as process gases, coolants and vacuum lines shall be explicitly stated. Each component of the system shall have internal electrical distribution and require only a single connection to a 110 V 30 amp or 208 single-phase connection per system. All non-cryogenic cooling of system components will be done, preferably, with water chillers employing thermo-electric removal of heat. The system will be installed in a temperature-controlled laboratory. All specifications laid out in this document are required to be met under these conditions. To minimize impact of the installation on on-going research in the lab, the complete system must be built and tested as one complete unit at the manufacturer's site, to ensure that performance specifications are met, before installation.<br />System Architecture:<br />After extensive market research, we have determined that only one specific system architecture for a laser workstation shall meet the needs of our project. This system shall be able to integrate our existing 10 kW IPG YLS-10000-Y13 fiber laser and capable of both prototype and production laser welding and cutting. This system will include high-accuracy motion control in three-dimensions. There workspace dimensions must be at least 500 mm by 500 mm by 200 mm in volume. There should be a CCD camera for live viewing of laser welding and cutting process. This laser workstation is a critical component of the NIST Laser Materials Processing program. As such, we require ongoing technical support as well as the ability to modify the workstation to meet future production and prototyping research tasks. The supplier must have the necessary technical expertise to accommodate these modifications that are not available with current technology. For safety purposes, the laser workstation enclosure must meet the requirements of a Class 1 laser enclosure.<br />3.

Warranty shall include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation. This warranty shall cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period. These systems are scheduled for ultimate installation in early 2014 in a building currently under construction at the NIST Boulder site. Given this situation, offerors should be cognizant of the fact that some time may elapse between delivery of the systems, installation on site, and commencement of the warranty period. NIST will consider proposals for "delivery in place" of the systems at the offeror's facility prior to installation. In no case, however, will the warranty period begin prior to on-site acceptance at NIST. This requirement shall supersede any of the offeror's standard terms and conditions. Preferences will be given to longer warranty periods.<br />To minimize our expenses in case of need for service, the laser manufacturer must have North America-based service personnel, and the system purchase must include a guarantee of service support on-site within 1 week during the warranty period.<br />Inspection and Final Acceptance:<br />1. In addition to the inspection and acceptance terms articulated in 52.212-4, the Government reserves the right to perform such performance tests and evaluations as deemed appropriate by the Government to verify specified system performance. Such tests and evaluations, if performed, shall be conducted within the environment that the system is to be operated. The Contractor has the right to be present during the tests and evaluations, if performed, at the Contractor's expense.<br />2. The technical requirements set forth herein must be satisfactorily met in their entirety and all associated tasks, including installation and training, must be completed prior to acceptance of the system/solution by NIST.<br />Factory Acceptance Tests:<br />Prior to shipment, the offeror shall demonstrate the previously listed "performance specifications" at the manufacturing site. NIST personnel shall have the option of witnessing the factory tests.

If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. In evaluating technical capability, strongest consideration shall be given to:<br />System Performance: This will be evaluated using the documentation provided by the offeror in response to section three (3) and four (4) of the functional specification.<br />Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing comparable equipment, and has demonstrated technical expertise in laser welding process development using their apparatus. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have sufficient skill with all the technologies they are proposing for the current requirement. The offeror will have worked with a minimum of 10 customers using laser welding workstations comparable to what will be supplied for this solicitation. Offeror should have customer support personnel with laser welding expertise and access to comparable laser welding workstations at their facility who are available for consultation on laser welding process development.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.<br />Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.<br />Non-Governmental Acquisition Support</p>
<p>The Government may utilize non-Governmental acquisition support for processing of quotations submitted in response to this solicitation.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt 0in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This notice is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Signal Perfection, LTD, 6301 Benjamin Road, Suite 101, Tampa, FL 33634 under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72 dated January 30, 2014.&nbsp;This firm-fixed price acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and is not a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334310&nbsp;and the small business size is 750 employees.<br /><br />This requirement is&nbsp;a follow-on action </span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">for additional Crestron room scheduling equipment and installation to support Collaborative Work Spaces/Team Rooms located at a new NIAID facility currently under construction at 5601 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland. Requirement specifications are provided in the attached Bill of Materials and Statement of Work. It has been determined that the Fishers Lane room scheduling equipment must be expanded to include the installation of 144 additional Crestron panels for the Collaborative Workspaces/Team Rooms. This expansion will keep the Team Rooms consistent with the Resource Libraries, as well as the divisible Center Conference Rooms. The additional equipment will allow NIAID staff to book rooms directly from the touch panels, thus eliminating the need to go through the current reservation process; the goal is to provide a highly effective level of staff collaboration. The panels will also display room availability, giving the staff alternatives in the event that a previously chosen site is already booked. Additionally, the touch panels will tie into the building's Fusion RV platform, which will provide OCICB with room utilization statistics. These statistics will be used to determine whether or not the rooms are useful as Team Rooms or if they can potentially be turned into offices. The touch screens must be Creston panels in order to connect to the back end Crestron infrastructure, a proprietary solution that is not compatible with other panels. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Signal Perfection, LTD is the currently awarded A/V integrator for the Fishers Lane A/V project and is providing equipment, project management, engineering and drafting, installation, and programming for the new facility since the competitive award of the 5601 Fishers Lane A/V Equipment &amp; Installation contract (Contract HHSN272201301072P) in fiscal year 2013. Signal Perfection is the sole project manager, engineer, drafter, installer and programmer of the Fishers Lane A/V project and is the only known source that possesses the requisite knowledge and expertise required to perform this effort. Given the complexity of the Fishers Lane A/V project and the level of system knowledge required to seamlessly integrate over 200 room subsystems into one coordinated whole, Signal Perfection is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully integrate this requirement into the system.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost, significant schedule risk, and significant risk to the Government. Failure to provide this work without delay would negatively impact the relocation schedule which would result in significant costs in additional rent and other associated costs to the Institute. Currently, the Fishers Lane facility has relocated several groups which will be impacted by disruptions in their respective work areas due to installation/work for this requirement. The contractor, Signal Perfection, must have the equipment/work in place by end of April 2014 in order to minimize impact to Fishers Lane resident employees and to meet the final completion date in October 2014.</span></p>

<p>9. 49.502 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum, respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics).

Failure to be properly registered at the time and date of award may render the quote non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

CONTRACTOR QUESTION:  Does this requirement ask for one (1) or two (2) ground rods per cabin? MEA requires two (2) per building structure.

CONTRACTOR QUESTION:   Will you accept a proposal for flooring material only? GOVERNMENT REPLY:  This solicitation is a request for quote for "All or NONE."  You may submit a proposal for less than all items; however be advised, the Contracting Officer may or may not review an incomplete proposal.

<DESC>The purpose of this Notice is to respond to Questions:<br /><br />Question 1. Does the work have to be performed on base, or can the vehicle be brought to our facility for the job?
<p>Answer 1: The work can be performed at the contractor's facility.</p>
<p><br />Question 2. If we are quoting the Donaldson SEF filter, are we responsible for installation of the regen panel? (It does not matter either way, I just need to know if that time and materials needs to be included in my quote as well).</p>
<p><br />Answer 2: The contractor would be responsible for installation of the regen panel if quoting the Donaldson SEF filter.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p><br />1.0. Introduction: The Marine Corps Regional Contracting Office (RCO) is procuring portable toilet rental and servicing on behalf of the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Center (MCAGTFTC)/Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, California.</p>
<p>2.0. Background: The MCAGTFTC/MCAGCC is a vast training center located in the lower Mojave Desert, approximately 70 miles north of Palms Springs. The installation is primarily utilized for desert war fighting training, and contains numerous ranges covering approximately 600,000 acres where military exercises are held. Some of the ranges are accessible by rough terrain, requiring the use of 4x4 vehicles. Some ranges are accessible by direct routes; however, if live-fire exercises are occurring, Range Control will close down the route and alternative routes with significantly longer travel times may be required.</p>
<p>2.1. The amount of usage varies with the size, number, and frequency of exercises. Historically, the larger exercises were called Mojave Viper (MV) and Enhanced Mojave Viper (EMV) exercises. These exercises consisted of training approximately 3000-6000 Marines on a monthly basis. These exercises were centered on training for Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF). A majority of the training was centered on close quarters training in a town like setting. As operations OIF and OEF are scaling down, the Marine Corps has transitioned to Integrated Training Exercises (ITX) and Large Scale Exercises (LSE). The historically high usage ranges have been phased out. Exercise transition to ITX and LSE consists of training approximately 6000-10,000 Marines. The ITX and LSE focus on the coordination of the entire MAGTF and will utilize more training space at MCAGCC.</p>
<p>2.2. There are over 900 miles of Main Surface Roads (MSR). The MSRs are not paved and sporadically maintained. Rain, Flash Floods and other Acts of God make some roads periodically impassable. Many of the roads lie in dry washes or cross dry washes. During periods of rain, the roads can be washed out to depths of 10 feet. In addition to the MSR, there are over 900 miles of trails that are not maintained and must be traversed utilizing 4 x 4 vehicles. The speed limit in all training areas is 25 miles per hour.</p>
<p>2.3. The base currently consists of three corridors. The west corridor begins just northwest of main side and continues north by northwest to the southwest of the Bullion Mountains running approximately from coordinates 84009100 up to 48004000. The delta corridor runs from the east of main side due north between the Bullion Mountains running approximately from coordinates 88008500 up to 88003100. The east corridor begins approximately from coordinate 97009575 due north up to 95752600. There is yet another corridor, currently unnamed, for which there will be future use that will run west to east from coordinate 36002700 to 10002700.</p>
<p>3.0. Scope of Work: The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, tools, materials, equipment, transportation, and other items necessary to provide the supplies/services required herein throughout the training ranges of MAGTFTC/MCAGCC with the exception of the Government Furnished Facilities, Equipment and Material listed in paragraph 5.4. The scope of this contract covers portable toilets and hand wash stations&nbsp;that are used to support the MAGTFTC/MCAGCC various training programs. Not included in the scope of work are portable toilets and hand wash stations&nbsp;utilized for special events in support of the Marine Corps Community Service mission, such as concerts and sporting events.</p>

<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). An individual appointed in writing by the Contracting Officer who is responsible for the technical direction and evaluation of the contractor's performance.<br />Customer Complaint Record (CCR). A format used by a government customer to register a complaint with the COR regarding the Contractor's quality or level of performance.<br />Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).

<p>5.0 Performance Requirements.</p>
<p>5.1. Personnel.</p>
<p>5.1.1. Project Manager: The Contractor shall provide a Project Manager who shall be designated as the primary point of contact and who shall be responsible for the daily performance of the contract. The name of this person and alternate(s), who shall act for the Contractor when the manager is absent, shall be designated in writing and approved by the Contracting Officer. The Project Manager may be required to meet weekly with the Contracting Officer. Subsequent meetings will be held as necessary. The Project Manager or alternate shall be available within two (2) hours, during normal working hours to meet with government personnel designated by the Contracting Officer to discuss problem areas.

No item of military clothing or clothing resembling military clothing may be worn. All employees of the contractor must be able to read, write, and understand English.</p>
<p>5.1.2.1. The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if the employment of that person would create a conflict of interest nor shall the Contractor employ any person who is an employee of the United States Marine Corps, either military or civilian, unless such person seeks and received approval in accordance with Joint Ethics Regulations.</p>
<p>5.2. Hours of Operation: Normal work hours are Sunday through Saturday 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. However, due to operational commitments, additional toilets and/or hand wash&nbsp;stations&nbsp;and/or services may also be required after normal working hours and holidays. Work may frequently be required on short notice (4 hours response time), however; at least 48 hours advance notice of requirements will be given if possible.</p>
<p>5.3. Providing and Servicing Portable Toilets.</p>
<p>5.3.1. General: The Contractor shall provide the required number of portable toilets that are specified in the attached spreadsheet. For the purpose of this contract, furnishing portable toilets shall coincide with the cleaning of the toilets, except for pick-up and delivery charges. The contractor may be required to divert long distances due to road closures caused by Range Control or as a result of flash floods and other adverse weather conditions. The government shall not be charged for aborted delivery or service attempts. The Contractor should anticipate an increase in usage on short notice among multiple ranges. This increase is known as "White Space" training. White space training is unplanned, unanticipated training that occurs with minimal lead time as a result of training ranges becoming available for use by unit commanders who decide to take advantage of the opportunity to expand their training experience aboard MAGTFTC/MCAGCC. The increase in usage may result in, but not limited to, changes from every other day service to everyday service or requests for additional toilets due to the highly diverse nature of the training conducted aboard MAGTFTC/MCAGCC. Contractors should note that historical usage has indicated White space CLINs may increase approximately 50% of "Known Training Locations" CLINs. The quantities listed on White Space CLINs 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, and 1008 are estimates only.</p>
<p>5.3.2. Portable Toilet Specifications: Portable toilets shall be made with a high-density polyethylene construction which are impervious to moisture, have urinals securely fastened to the tank or structure, have adequate drain flow, be of the non-flush type, skid mounted, and shall have a toilet seat, a toilet paper holder designed for that purpose, screened ventilation, an outside door handle, and an inside locking door latch. Toilets provided under this contract need not be new, but are to be in a serviceable condition, without holes or chemical leaks, of a material having a nonabsorbent finish, and the doors, hinges, and latches shall operate as intended. Collapsible and wood toilets and toilets with open grid flooring are NOT ACCEPTABLE. Contractor shall ensure that all portable toilets are staked or tied down to prevent spillage. Placement of sand bags, to include inside or on top of, securing the toilets is NOT ACCEPTABLE. Contractor shall ensure portable toilets are not placed within 20 feet of any storm channel or natural wash.</p>
<p>5.3.3. Delivery Requirements: The government will require the Contractor to deliver, locate, and service portable toilets in rough terrain or unpaved areas. Therefore, delivery to and servicing at these areas will require the Contractor to use heavy-duty four-wheel drive (4WD) vehicles.</p>
<p>5.3.4. Delivery Charges: Delivery and pick-up charges shall be a combined fee to include one servicing at the time of pick-up, and shall include all costs associated with delivery and pickup. Delivery charges shall be billed at the time delivery is made, regardless of when pickup will occur. Delivery charges are also applicable when an order is placed and accepted and subsequently cancelled after the delivery has been made.</p>
<p>5.3.5. Orders for Delivery: The government will provide an eight-digit grid coordinate that designates the location that the portable toilets are to be placed. Toilets that are misplaced as a result of the Contractor's misreading of the map shall be relocated at no additional charge.</p>
<p>5.3.6. Removal: The Contractor shall remove all portable toilets from training areas within three (3) working days of completion of the order or notification of any early termination of services.</p>
<p>5.3.7. Routine Portable Toilet Cleaning: The Contractor shall provide cleaning of toilets at the intervals specified in attachments B and C. The initial placement of a toilet or hand wash station does not constitute the first cleaning. Service stickers are to be located on the inside of the portable toilet door showing the date of cleaning services and the individual performing those services.</p>
<p>5.3.7.1. Trash shall be removed by the contractor, placed in sealed trash bags and driven from the site to the nearest trash receptacle. Trash from sites other than MAGTFTC/MCAGCC shall not be placed in government trash receptacles. Excessive trash will be brought to the attention of the COR and/or the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>5.3.7.2. The contractor may reserve their obligation to service the unit(s) in question if servicing of the unit may be harmful to the operators (i.e. suspected ammunition in the portable toilet). The COR shall be notified immediately of such situations, and the contractor shall follow the COR's instructions.</p>
<p>5.3.7.3. Resupply toilets whenever serviced with adequate supplies to maintain the serviceability between servicing. A minimum of two (2) rolls of 2-ply toilet paper shall be placed in toilets, provide an odorless disinfectant and maintain fluid of between five (5) to seven (7) gallons.</p>
<p>5.3.7.4. Provide and utilize chemicals that have been approved for use in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and all applicable Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of the Navy (DON) regulations. The contractor shall comply with sustainable acquisition policies, which apply to both contracts for supplies and services that require the delivery, use, or furnishing of products. Sustainable acquisition includes products that are energy-efficient and water-efficient, bio based, environmentally preferable, non-ozone depleting, are made with recovered materials, or use renewable energy technologies. See FAR Part 23. The contractor shall comply with all changes to sustainable acquisition policies (e.g., addition of USDA-designated items), and such compliance will not be grounds for contract modification or equitable adjustment.</p>
<p>5.3.8. Emergency Services: The government may require the Contractor to provide additional cleaning and maintenance services when directed by the Contracting Officer or COR.</p>
<p>5.3.8.1. Standard: The Contractor shall respond to calls for service within four (4) hours of being notified during normal work hours, or twelve (12) hours after normal working hours. Response is measured at the Contractor's arrival on base, not the response to the service location.</p>
<p>5.3.9. Toilet Maintenance: As part of the service fees, the Contractor shall maintain and repair toilets as necessary to keep them in good working order and with a good appearance. All dirt, mud, dust, markings, and graffiti shall be removed from the interior and exterior of the toilets. When it appears to the Contractor that damages to a unit is due to deliberate and extensive abuse by government personnel, the Contractor shall contact the COR to arrange a joint inspection prior to commencing repairs. The determination of the Contracting Officer (KO) concerning government responsibility is final and adverse determination shall not constitute grounds for contractor claim or equitable adjustment. Claims for excessive damages or total losses as a result of government action or inaction shall be treated as a contract claim and handled under the disputes clause.</p>
<p>5.3.9.1. Any required repairs or replacement of equipment, including but not limited to urinals, latches, hinges, toilet paper dispensers, and toilet seats shall be made when required. In the event the toilet is leaking, the toilet shall be removed from service immediately.</p>
<p>5.3.9.1.1. Standard: Repairs or replacement of non-repairable/unserviceable units shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours of discovery by the Contractor's personnel or notification by the government. Failure of the Contractor's personnel to report the problem will not be an acceptable reason for non-performance.</p>

<p><br /><br />MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions: <br />1. Access Procedures Are Mandatory: The contractor shall comply with all current access procedures throughout all performance periods under this contract, and changes to these procedures shall not constitute grounds for contractor claims or request for equitable adjustment. All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access. Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below. Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.</p>
<p>2. Business Access: Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year. Submit the following:</p>
<p>&bull; A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.<br />&bull; If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof<br />of insurance.<br />&bull; Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the<br />prime contractor including contract number and term).<br />&bull; Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year<br />covering the previous two years. Contractor employee background checks are<br />conducted at contractor expense. The background check:</p>
<p>(a) must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status. Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.<br />(b) must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years). <br />(c) will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III). If the background check is selected for verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database. NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at<br />Government expense.</p>
<p>Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) of the Combat Center. For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).</p>

Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor's expense.</p>
<p>4. Emergency Access: Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities. The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.</p>
<p>5. Installation Access Badges: Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation. The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense. The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.</p>
<p>6. Denial of Access: The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission. In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access. Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract. Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:<br />a. is on the National Terrorist watch List.<br />b. is illegally present in the United States.<br />c. is subject to an outstanding warrant.<br />d. has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent information.<br />e. has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.</p>
<p>7. Employee Identification: Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>8. Employee Compliance. The Contractor's employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.</p>
<p>9. Contract Termination: The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.</p>

Key criteria for the training ammunition includes, but is not limited to: being easily distinguishable from duty ammunition (both in packaging and cartridge appearance), and meeting ballistic criteria to insure officer competency requirements are achievable.</p>

<DESC><strong>Sources Sought - Whole Facilities Maintenance Services </strong>
<p>Client Agency: Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX<br />Procuring Agency: General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Region 8</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>The Government is contemplating issuing a single Request for Proposal (RFP) that will result in award of multiple Contracts for whole facility maintenance services to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) commissaries throughout the United States, to include Alaska and Hawaii, and territories of Guam and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Notification:</strong> <br /><br />This announcement is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to award a contract either now or in the future. No award will be made as a result of this announcement. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Any information that the Vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned, including any proprietary information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. <br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to assist GSA in identifying capable, qualified small and large business sources. Small businesses participating in any of the Small Business Administration Programs (Small business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small business, SBA Certified 8(a) Firm, SBA Certified Hubzone firm or self declared) that are interested in submitting information for this requirement must be aware that they must perform at least 50% of the effort with their employees.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>DeCA is unique as they are the only supermarket agency in the Department of Defense. The critical tasks for this requirement are in the maintenance and monitoring of the commissary refrigeration systems. Each facility contains a large amount of mechanical and electrical equipment necessary to provide continuous, redundant environmental support to mission-critical food supplies. Because of the complexity and constancy of the required support, DeCA requires dedicated maintenance, repair, engineering, and other service support contractors in order to ensure that mission-critical food supplies are continuously available. At risk is the $1 million to $2 million worth of perishable goods at each commissary. Said services are required for DeCA CONUS commissaries (including Alaska and Hawaii) and OCONUS commissaries (including three commissaries in Guam and 2 in Puerto Rico). Each contract will be structured into maintenance groups (MG) as shown in the attached Figure 1 - Maintenance Groups.</p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT OF NEED:</strong></p>
<p>DeCA has a requirement to maintain their commissary facilities through the award of Whole Facilities Maintenance Service contracts. DeCA's mission is focused on providing routine and mission-critical groceries and supermarket services to military men and women, their families, and military retirees. DeCA operates a large amount of mechanical and electrical equipment necessary to provide continuous, redundant environmental support which is required 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. DeCA's operational goal is to provide this service regardless of geographic location. This requirement is to supply whole facilities maintenance services to approximately 265 DeCA locations including commissaries, cold storage, distribution, and administrative facilities in the United States and US Territories.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide management, supervision, personnel, tools, parts, materials, general and specialized equipment, electronic communication and reporting, and transportation necessary to perform the requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>There are two main types of DeCA maintenance, preventative and unscheduled. Unscheduled maintenance is further broken down into the following four subcategories:<br />&bull; Emergency Maintenance and Repairs (2 hour response)<br />&bull; Priority Maintenance (respond by noon following business day)<br />&bull; Routine Maintenance (respond and schedule within 7 days) <br />&bull; Repair and Maintenance (Major system replacement, HVAC, refrigeration, incidental construction)</p>
<p>Other requirements may include:<br />* Monthly reporting <br />* Implementation and utilization of a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) including training of the CMMS<br />* Establish and operate a 24-hour call center<br />* Outside service call/dispatch capabilities<br />* Multiple location functionality<br />* Refrigeration Monitoring Center Service (RMCS) record keeping<br />* Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local criteria</p>
<p>The current DeCA Whole Facilities Maintenance contracts are in their last option year. The Government anticipates multiple Indefinite Delivery Requirements contracts will be awarded under one solicitation for this requirement. It is GSA FAS' intent to award 8 contracts, one for each of the maintenance groups, that include a 1-year base with four 1-year options. The ceiling is estimated to be $356 million, across all awards. <br /><br /><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></p>
<p>Contractors are requested to respond to the announcement by submitting the following information:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT<br /><br />Per FAR 5.203(d), Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration anticipates awarding two or more Full-Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for architect-engineer (A-E) services. Projects will primarily involve improvements to rural low-volume roadways in environmentally sensitive areas requiring context sensitive design solutions for work ranging from pavement preservation, to 3R (resurfacing, restoration and rehabilitation) to full reconstruction. Transportation-related engineering and surveying services will include all work needed to conduct planning, scoping, environmental compliance, preliminary and final design to prepare contract documents in support of several Federally-funded programs administered by CFLHD.
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACT: This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis to A-E firms licensed and registered within one or more of the states served by CFLHD. Professional documents produced under each contract will require a Professional Engineer and/or a Registered Land Surveyor license relative to the state in which the project work is located. Each contract awarded will consist of 1 base year and options to extend the contract for 4 additional 1-year periods. Each successful A-E firm will be re-evaluated each year to determine award of options to extend the contract. The contract shall have a maximum not-to-exceed 5-year total of $10 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated, firm-fixed price task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders may or may not be for a complete project or series of projects.</p>
<p>Selected firms must comply with Equal Employment Opportunity requirements in accordance with FAR 22.8. Subcontracting plans will be required by the selected firms for large businesses in accordance with FAR 19.7. The subcontracting plan must show the firms intended use of small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business concerns. Subcontracting Plans are not required with submission of SF 330.</p>

<CONTACT>Pedro M. Godinez, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022608500, Email pedro.godinez@hhs.gov - Linda I Luczak, Contracting Officer, Email linda.luczak@hhs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2. THIS COMPETITIVE ACTION IS BEING PROCURED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Office of Acquisitions Management, Contracts &amp; Grants (AMCG) seek to establish a contract for year-round supply of Embryonated Eggs for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness</p>
<p>In less than 100 years there have been four influenza pandemics: The Spanish Flu of 1918, the Asian Flu of 1957, the Hong Kong Flu of 1968, and most recently the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. Production of a vaccine to immunize against the influenza strain causing the next pandemic must occur as quickly as possible at any time of year. The ability to achieve this objective currently is limited by the seasonal nature of influenza vaccine production and seasonal variability in the availability of supplies essential to vaccine manufacture. Assuring the early availability of a sufficient quantity of vaccine for the U.S. population in the setting of a pandemic will potentially prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars.<br /><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has an obligation to promote capabilities that assure a pandemic vaccine can be produced at a U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine facility at any time of the year, without limitations imposed by the availability of essential supplies. In addition DHHS is interested in development of investigational influenza vaccine lots against potential pandemic strains. An ongoing program is designed to support these interests.<br /><br />The purpose of this requirement is&nbsp;to assure the year-round availability of sufficient embryonated hens' eggs and other essential supplies to support production of pandemic influenza vaccine at full current capacity.<br /><br /><strong>There are two (2) Mandatory Evaluation Criteria which Offerors must satisfy to be eligible for consideration under this solicitation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. U.S. Vaccine Manufacturing:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Offeror must provide evidence of access to domestic supplies of embryonated eggs and domestic FDA licensed facilities for the manufacture of bulk and fill-finished final container egg-based pandemic influenza virus vaccine for human use for the period of performance of the contract.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Biosafety Compliance:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Offeror must provide evidence the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with current WHO biosafety guidelines for pandemic vaccine manufacturing including BSL2+ enhanced biocontainment facilities and procedures.</strong></p>
<p>Additional Technical Evaluation Criteria are applicable and will be stated in the solicitation. There will not be a pre-proposal conference in the solicitation so all questions must be addressed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Small Businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities can contact the Contracting Officer or Offerors identified on http://www.fbo.gov. Only one award is anticipated as a result of this solicitation. The period of performance for the proposed contract shall be 36 months with no option periods. It is anticipated the solicitation shall be issued within 15 days of this announcement. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the http://www.fbo.gov. As such, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored. Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor http://www.fbo.gov for any solicitation amendments. Any responsive and responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to making an award under this solicitation. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number 14-100-SOL-00004, name of company, business size, Point of Contract (POC) including email address, mailing address, telephone number, and fax number, should be submitted to the Contracting Officer identified in this notice.</p>

All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />&nbsp;<br />OS/ASPR/Acquisition Management Contracts and Grants (AMCG)<br />330 Independence Avenue, SW, Room G-644<br />Washington, District of Columbia 20201</p>

UPDATE (04/07/14): The Government has received several questions about Market Survey/RFI N66001-14-R-0042.
See below clarification for updates:
Revised Market Survey attached.  The revised Market Survey has increased the NAICS small business size standard threshold to $35.5M.  The revised Market Survey has also extended the timeframe for Market Survey questions and the Market Survey closing date. N66001-14-R-0042 is similar, but not the same, as N66001-13-R-0041. N66001-14-R-0042 has added section 3.2.12 to the draft PWS.  Additionally, the scope (specifically LOE) has changed.  26 FTEs are anticipated under this procurement.  A significant material purchase will also be included as a part of this contract (see attached draft Bill of Materials).  The dollar value of the procurement is estimated between $50M and $100M.  N66001-13-R-0041 is canceled.

<a href="mailto:carole.householder@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Pittsburgh</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, has a project that involves the construction of the River Chamber Completion, Monoliths M-22 to M-227 at Charleroi Locks and Dam, Monongahela River, PA.  The major features of the requirement are identified below:  <br>    <br>  Construction of the River Chamber Completion, Monoliths M-22 to M-27, consists of building steel cofferboxes in order to construct the new reinforced concrete Middle Wall monoliths numbered M-22 to M-27, fabrication and installation of precast concrete culverts within the Middle Wall cofferboxes, relocating the electrical and dam control utilities from the lock side to the dam abutment side including construction of a new elevated platform supporting a new temporary electrical generator, areas of partial and complete removal of the existing river wall and fixed crest weir concrete sections using in-the-wet methods, modifying existing sheet pile structures, removal of a sheet pile structure, stabilization of existing lock walls, instrumentation installation, and instrumentation monitoring.  The work is to be performed using a combination of in-the-wet and in-the-dry construction methods.   The lock wall monoliths will be built using a combination of tremie concrete and cast-in-place concrete within a cofferbox.  The precast concrete culverts are three sided culverts and are to be fabricated off site at a commercial precast fabrication facility.  Onsite fabrication of the precast concrete culvert will not be permitted.  The M-22 to M-27 New Middle Wall section is approximately 260 feet by 35 feet in plan and is located riverward of the downstream end of the existing Middle Wall for the land lock chamber.  Construction of the lock wall involves underwater excavation of both soil and rock; heavy lifting and placement of the precast culverts from a floating plant; sheet piles, king piles and associated steel waler and strut installation for cofferbox construction from a floating plant; drilled shaft foundations; as well as operation and maintenance of the Government owned Concrete Batch Plant, concrete delivery system, and ancillary items.  Maintenance of the batch plant will include repair and/or replacement of various items necessary for continued operation of the plant.    <br>    <br>  Disposal of suitable excavated materials and concrete rubble without embedded ferrous material will be required.  The offloading area at Victory Hollow (VH), approximately 7 miles downstream of Charleroi Locks and Dam, will be utilized to stockpile and dispose of the suitable materials from the construction activities.  Ferrous and other construction waste material will be disposed at a commercially permitted facility licensed to accept the waste or recycled if applicable.  <br>    <br>  Construction work will occur in close proximity to waterway traffic.  The existing landside lock chamber is currently operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Maintaining unimpeded access (to the extent possible under this contract) of this facility to waterway traffic and maintaining stability of the existing middle wall are underlying goals of this contract.   <br>    <br>  Environmental protection will include requirements to remain in compliance with the existing NPDES permitting at both VH and the Concrete Batch Plant.  <br>    <br>  The magnitude of the project is between $25,000 and $100,000.  This procurement will be advertised on an Unrestricted basis.  The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued approximately May 27, 2014 online only through the Federal Business Opportunities website; therefore, requests for hardcopies of the specifications and drawings will not be honored.    <br>    <br>    <br>

Introduction: <br />This Sources Sought Notice is issued by the Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD), on behalf of the WHS/ Enterprise Information Technology Services Directorate (WHS/EITSD). This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes and is not a request for proposals. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based upon responses received from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government/WHS/AD. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain information and receive industry comments that will be instrumental in assisting the Government in (1) locating potential sources with the ability/capability to satisfy its requirement, (2) determining an appropriate acquisition method and contract type to procure a requirement of this nature, and (3) obtaining information that will assist the Government in improving existing services resulting in a stable and secure enterprise Information Technology (IT) network that meets the functionality, speed, and capacity expectations of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) end users while complying with Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal rules and regulations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">*****SEE ATTACHED SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE&nbsp;FOR FULL DETAILS*****<br /></span></strong><br />The Government is looking to identify all qualified sources under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541513 entitled "Computer Facilities Management Services"</p>
<p>Responses from all sources are requested including Small Businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Businesses.</p>
<p>A contract is anticipated to be awarded in calendar year 2015 with a one-year base period and three one-year option periods.

The Prime Source/Joint Venture shall have successfully completed a Third-Party/External audit through a Registered Certification Body (RCB), and shall have subsequently achieved ISO/IEC 20000-1 Certification. While there exists a strong preference for the ISO/IEC 20000-1 Certification, a Prime Source/Joint Venture may substitute a successful appraisal of CMMI-SVC Level III (Service).</p>
<p>Furthermore, regardless of the aforementioned appraisals and certifications, all Prime Source/Joint Ventures shall have been;</p>
<p>2. Successfully Appraised at CMMI-DEV Level III (Development)</p>
<p>Subcontractor certifications may not supplant the requirement that Prime Sources/Joint Venture be appraised and/or certified at the required certifications.</p>

<p>Secondly, the response time has been extended:<br /><br />TO: 28 APRIL 2014</p>
<p>Thirdly, <br /><br />2. Required format:</p>
<p>1. The Title page: (5th bullet)</p>
<p>&bull; Potential Source's Teaming Arrangement Structure - Examples include: Sole Contractor; Prime Contractor with Subcontractor(s); Prime Contractor with team member Subcontractor(s); or a Joint Venture. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between work that will be accomplished by the prime and that accomplished by teaming partners. Responses should also indicate the formation date of the teaming arrangement.<br /><br />Finally,</p>
<p>Section 3. - Past Performance Response:</p>
<p>Potential Prime Sources/Joint Venture are requested to provide a past performance summary with up to five (5) previous contracts whose effort is current and relevant to the size (16,000 users), scope, and complexity of the effort required by this Sources Sought Notice. Contracts are defined as any Federal, State, and Local Government contracts as well as any private contracts. Current is defined as a contract (prime or subcontract) in-progress or completed within the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>If the Prime Source/Joint Venture does not have five (5) contracts within the last five (5) years in which it was the Prime Source, then the Prime Source/Joint Venture may submit past performance from contracts on which it served as a subcontractor. Past performance information should not include historical evidence for proposed subcontractors.</p>

<DESC>This award derives from the Proposed Contract Action (FA8751-14-R-0016).<br />Award was made under FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation and Other Than<br />Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1) authority. A redacted Justification<br />and Approval (J&amp;A) document is attached to this notice.<br /><br />AFRL requires the purchase of a software toolset to bridge their<br />communications with current data-link software technology. The software<br />package needs to bridge incompatible operational waveforms LINK-16 and<br />Situational Awareness Data Link [SADL] and provide interoperability between<br />different data formats to include LINK-16 J-Messages, Cursor on Target<br />[COT], Keyhole Markup Language [KML], Key Length Value [KLV] while providing<br />user friendly operation to tactical users.<br /><br />Required Capabilities:
<p>&#9474;Host Platform J Link-16 radios <br />&#9474;Host SADL radios <br />&#9474;Enable J-Message text chat<br />&#9474;Provide interoperability and forwarding between datalinks<br />&#9474;Contain an easily transferrable SA Mode database <br />&#9474;Utilize an intuitive user interface<br />&#9474;Perform JREAPC client functions<br />&#9474;Provide the ability to connect directly to SA Mode radios<br />&#9474;Provide the ability to organize received data<br /><br /><br />The government has determined no other company's software offers an<br />all-in-one communications bridging solution, operable by the tactical user.<br />Alternatives do not offer the intuitiveness of TRAX, and are not easily<br />configured in the field; alternatives require in-depth knowledge of actual<br />waveforms for configuration, which may be beyond the training of the end<br />user, who simply requires communications interoperability.</p>

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
ORDER >$3,000
FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 583-14-2-114-0296		  

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: CAREFUSION 2200  V797P-4311B	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Jennifer Kline 502-727-8256	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 3750 Torrey View Ct, San Diego, CA 92130	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: 502-727-8256	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center
		
                                                                          VISN:	11	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Brand Name Justification for Carefusion Gensis Sterilization containers and supplies.	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
 Carefusion Gensis Sterilization containers, baskets, filters, mats in assorted sizes.   $28,389.78, Carefusion 2200, Inc 3850 Torrey View Ct, San Diego, CA 92130	
       (b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $28, 389.78	
	
       (c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   April 11, 2014	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Carefusion 2200 is the only vendor that offers Carefusion Genesis Sterilization containers via an FSS Contract, V797P4311B.  The Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center already uses about 150 Carefusion Genesis Sterilization Containers in SPD.  These containers all use common tops, bottoms,  filter retention plate, baskets, filters, mats and other disposable parts.  Other brands, Medline and Miltex, would not offer this interchangability and should a top, bottom, or filter retuention plate get damaged, SPD would have to order new parts instead of simply swapping out componants and continuing with sterilization procedures.	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
The Genesis Sterilization containers already in use at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center all use common tops, bottoms,  filter retention plates , baskets, as well as filters, mats and other disposable parts.  Other brands, Medline and Miltex, would not offer this interchangability and should a top, bottom, or filter retuention plate get damaged, SPD would have to order new parts instead of simply swapping out componants and continuing with sterilization procedures. 	






0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	





(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This order represents the best value to the government because it allows for standardization of Sterilization containers for SPD at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, allowing less disposables to be stocked,  and interchangeablility of component parts, tops bottoms, filter plates,  resulting in greater efficiency. 

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS was searched, this vendor was the only source of Gensis Sterilization containers via an FSS Contract, V797P-4311B.  	
     	


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey.	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)
