<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement to develop high efficiency, free piston Stirling convertors as called for in the congressional Conference Report on H. R. 2862, Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006.  Preliminary work will be performed toward development of a nuclear-fission-powered 30 kW Stirling power system for use on the lunar surface with a specific power goal of about 140 W/kg for the Stirling power conversion system.  The initial step, planned for this procurement, is the design and development of a nominal 5 kW per cylinder Stirling convertor assembly (SCA) which will serve as a prototype of one or more SCAs that will make up the final 30 kW lunar surface power system.  Via the planned contract with Auburn University, it is anticipated that Auburn will procure the prototype SCA design from one of the major US Stirling free-piston manufacturers. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the research from Auburn University under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5). The procurement will be implemented by FAR 6.302-5 which authorizes Other Than Full and Open Competition when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specified source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for provide four (4) additional Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASC).  The design and operating characteristics of these units shall be identical to the current design of the non-hermetic ASC-1 except where required in order to meet the following: 1.	All four convertors shall be hermetically sealed 2.	Two of these convertors shall be designed to operate with Heater Heads made of Inconel 718 to allow 650 C operation.  (termed ASC-0, designating the lower temperature configuration) 3.	Two of these convertors shall be designed to operate with Heater Heads made of MarM-247 to allow 850 C operation. (termed ASC-1HS, designating ASC-1 configuration, Hermetically Sealed) 4.	Prior to hermetically sealing the convertors, “burn-in” testing of the convertors shall be performed in order to demonstrate and establish acceptable baseline performance. 5.	After hermetically sealing the convertors, each unit shall be operated to establish baseline hermetic performance 6.	Testing shall be conducted with the convertors in single unit configuration for checkout purposes and also in matched dual-opposed configuration to allow tuning of the matched pairs prior to hermetic sealing.  Testing shall also include thermal cycles (stop/start) and continuous operation as needed in order to identify any infant mortality or non-conformance issues prior to hermetic sealing. Government Furnished Property: The following shall be provided to the contractor from the Government.	These items provide an efficient means of conducting “burn-in” testing, and also ensures seamless integration of the hardware into the GRC facility once delivered. 1.	Data rack and controller.  This data rack and controller shall be used for “burn-in” testing of the convertors prior to and after hermetic sealing and will allow autonomous operation and thermal cycling.  This rack is a self contained unit typical of those to be used in the GRC facility.  Quantity: 1. 2.	Heat rejection flange hardware.  The heat rejection flanges are components which will be joined to the convertors during the fabrication process.  The flange allows adaptation of the convertors for in-air operation as well as thermal vacuum operation.  Quantity: at least eight. 3.	Heat collector design.	The design shall be utilized by the contractor in fabrication of the heat collectors and these components will be joined to the convertor during the assembly and fabrication process.  The heat collector allows integration of the convertors with the GRC heat input hardware.  Design only, no hardware. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES: 1. ASC-0 with IN718 heater head (Quantity 2) 2. ASC-1HS with MarM-247 heater head (Quantity 2) 3. Copies of the production “travelers” and log books associated with each ASC unit 4. Summary report including burn-in test data for the ASC convertors 5. Drawing set of the ASC-0 and ASC-1HS 6. Listing of Data to be Furnished with Restrictions PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Delivery of the two ASC-0 convertors shall be no later than July 28, 2006.  Delivery of the two ASC-1HS convertors shall be no later than September 29, 2006.  The period of performance through March 31, 2007 remains in effect NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from SUNPOWER, of ATHENS, OHIO 45701.  Sunpower, under its current contract NAS3-03128, is uniquely capable of providing these additional ASC units using designs and technologies that required substantial development during Phase I and the ongoing Phase II of this contract.  In the fabrication of the ASC’s Sunpower has applied its proprietary technology along with its considerable expertise and experience.   The ASC design developed during Phase I and Phase II of this contract is currently the highest efficiency free-piston Stirling convertor ever produced.	There would be substantial duplication of cost to the Government to award a contract for these four additional ASC’s to another vendor.  The new vendor would have to duplicate research efforts already performed by Sunpower in order to develop an ASC that meets the current high efficiency level that these units meet.  These costs would not be expected to be recovered using a competitive procurement.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Irene.Cierchacki-1@nasa.gov later than 4:30 p.m. local time April 27, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovating research proposals in the area of micro-meter scale energy storage.  

The Department of Defense continues to develop very small remote sensors, robotic devices and electronic systems.  The computing and sensing technologies as well as the sensors on these micro systems continue to shrink in volume, weight, and power requirements.   In many cases, the limiting component for the overall lifetime, volume, or weight of these small systems is the power source.

The challenge is to develop high energy dense, low volume power sources, which are scalable to fit the energy needs of micro electromechanical systems (MEMS), and easily integrated into various small device and systems architectures.

The development and demonstration of these power sources is the subject of this solicitation. 


PROGRAM SCOPE

The MPS Program will consist of three Phases with contractor defined Go Ahead critical milestones at the end of each phase. Clearly stated, quantitative milestones at each phase with clearly defined deliverables are required. Organizations wishing to participate in Phases II and III should include them as options in their proposal. It is expected that proposers will deliver between 2-5 prototype power sources to the Government for testing and integration on a relevant micro system to determine performance at the end of each phase of the program. Offerers will also be responsible for monthly technical progress reports. A list and timetable of deliverables should be included in the proposal. Multiple awards are anticipated. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort. Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Ms. Sharon Beermann-Curtin, sharon.beermann-curtin@darpa.mil.

Teaming is strongly encouraged but is not a requirement. The viability of teaming arrangements, including tasks and measurable milestones for each team member, should be clearly explained in the proposal.  Emphasis will be placed on integrated approaches, i.e. integrated teams formed to better address the wide breadth of technological and scientific aspects of the MPS Program. For example, areas of expertise that might be incorporated into these teams include materials science, device physics, design, simulation, fabrication, testing, and integration, etc. Teaming between industries, commercial and defense system integrators, federal and national laboratories, and universities with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged.  

Each team will address the challenges discussed above and form an integrated program leading to functional, high performance energy sources.  We realize that this is a challenging and high-risk program.  In order to mitigate risk, we envision that different teams with different technical approaches will be supported.  

A website (http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-06-033/index.cgi) has been established to facilitate teaming between interested parties.  Interested parties may post on the web site the points of contact (POC), their address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail information and any non-proprietary information about their areas of expertise and interest that may help in forming the teams.  Specific information content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibilities of the participants. Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination website or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination. This website is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.

Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-33, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-33) on or before 12:00 p.m., local time, Wednesday, May 19, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.Gov.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-33 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make awards without discussion.  In the event that DARPA desires to award only portions of a proposal, negotiations will be opened with that offeror.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Micro-Power Sources (MPS).

The DIS processes the standard commercial format products into Controlled Image Based (CIB) and other formatted products for use in the combat commander's mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems. <br><br> The added CARTOSAT capability will allow Eagle Vision to program the satellite, receive and archive the telemetry, and process the data into commercial level 1 products and, CIB, GeoTIFF and NITF imagery.  The CARTOSAT capability will be able to produce panchromatic and multispectral imagery.  All CARTOSAT supported beam modes and polarization are required.

<DESC>This notice is issued pursuant to FAR 15.202, Advisory multi-step process.  This notice contains a description of a new requirement and instructions on how companies should respond.  This notice is not the actual solicitation, but is for the purpose of determining which companies are interested and to evaluate their solution viability prior to soliciting proposals.  GSA will notify companies responding to this notice if they are invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  If a company is determined not to be a viable competitor, they are not precluded from submitting a proposal once the actual solicitation is issued.  The solicitation for this requirement is expected for release within the next 30 days.  This notice does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government, and does not guarantee that an actual solicitation or a contract will be issued.
1.0  Overview
1.1  The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is seeking information for a workload management software suite; a.k.a. job queuing and scheduling system.  The resulting contract will consist of a four-year base period and six one-year option periods.  The workload management software (WMS) suite will be deployed across the entire suite of heterogeneous HPC hardware resources located at the HPCMP Major Shared Resource Centers (MSRCs) and Allocated Distributed Centers (ADCs).  See www.hpcmo.hpc.mil for an HPCMP overview.  
1.2  The HPC systems are operated as shared resources to serve the DoD Science and Technology and Test and Evaluation communities.  Workload management consists of a layered software capability that is tightly integrated with the HPC system’s operating system and/or native resource manager.  The WMS accepts all users requests for computational resources (processors, memory, software) and schedules those requests against the available resources on the system to help ensure an overall most efficient use of the total system (s’) resources while meeting the operating policies specified by the organization.  HPCMP HPC resources are currently operated primarily in a batch mode but there are increasing instances of requirements for alternate and more complex workload management capabilities. 
1.3  The resulting contract from this acquisition will provide a commercial software capability to address all WM requirements on all HPCMP allocated systems and test systems supporting allocated systems.  An allocated system is a DoD HPCMP HPC system for which all or some substantial sub-set of the CPU hours available on that system are allocated to DoD projects with multiple users operating under each project.  Each project is annually allocated a specific number of CPU hours and as that project uses those CPU hours, the project’s allocation is decremented.  Test systems are small systems of like architecture to larger production systems that the Centers or the HPCMP office use to test new software configurations or capabilities.  It is anticipated that the selected WMS will first be deployed on HPCMP systems planned for delivery in the June 2007 timeframe.  The actual solicitation will request a transition plan for existing systems.  
1.4  The product of this acquisition is “linked” to another acquisition of HPC systems that the HPCMP conducts annually known as Technology Integration XX (TI-XX) where XX is the fiscal year of system deployment.  The TI-XX acquisition requires HPC OEMs to delivery large HPC systems to HPCMP Centers such as the MSRCs and ADCs.   Included in the TI-XX acquisition are requirements for acceptance testing and follow-on HW and SW maintenance.  The Government intends to include in all TI-XX acquisitions from this point forward a requirement for the TI-XX winning offeror to accept the selected HPCMP WMS as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), integrate the WMS into their offering and include it in their acceptance testing and HW/SW maintenance terms and conditions; i.e. if the HPC system fails to perform and it is the fault of the WMS, it is the TI-XX vendor’s responsibility to resolve the issue.  Note that the Government’s WMS software maintenance contract is available to them as GFE to assist in the resolution of the problem.  Accordingly, all TI-07 (and beyond) acquisitions will include the above-described requirement.
1.5  TI-XX contract awards are typically made to one to three vendors for two to four systems each year.  Awards are typically made in late December or early January with system deliveries in the May-June timeframe and full acceptance by September.  Should TI offerors choose not to share their offerings with the WMS contractor earlier due to acquisition sensitive issues, the WMS contractor would be required to port and test their product to the selected systems between mid-January to May.  This is an important requirement to be sensitive to as the lack of a WMS (supplied as GFE to the TI vendor) would be an excellent opportunity for the TI vendor to leverage the non-functional GFE as the reason for a delayed delivery; avoiding late delivery penalties.  In such cases, the Government reserves the right to hold the WMS vendor responsible.
1.6 Because this software is so integrated into the TI machines and is instrumental in determining success of the TI systems as described above in paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5, the Government has determined that it is in its best interest to limit this acquisition to companies who are original software developers of a commercial product (sometimes referred to as OEMs – except it is software instead of equipment).  Three factors contribute to this decision:
a.  The porting and testing of the software product to the various TI acquired systems will require the intense involvement of the original software developers and their relationships with the TI vendors.  Adding a reseller function into this requirement increases the complexity of the relationships introducing added indirect and/or direct costs, increased risk and little or no added value; i.e. it’s most efficient for the TI vendor to work directly with the WMS OEM.   
b.  The pursuit of a commercial product is desirable as investments made by the OEM over the 10-year contract duration to address other commercial requirements can be leveraged to address DoD requirements and visa versa; allowing the DoD to leverage the commercial product development activities toward lower product and maintenance costs.  
c.  The requirement for the TI vendors to participate in the installation of the product coupled with the ability to leverage existing technical services contracts already in place at the Centers for sustainment alleviates the need for additional professional services; the area where a reseller would typically add value.
1.7 Historical TI investments have ranged from $30-40M annually.  Additional intermittent investments can occur at the ADCs.  Some have been as significant as $30M in a given year.  Commensurate with the annual investment, the HCPMP typically decommissions systems that are 48 months or older.  There is also sometimes a short overlap of a few months when new installations are in place and those systems planned for decommission have not yet been removed; requiring a short burst for additional WMS capability.  Figure 1 and 2 show the HABU (one HABU equivalent represents the equivalent performance of the weighted DoD benchmark suite on a 1024 CPU IBM power 3 system) and GF counts acquired via the historical investments and decommissioning of systems.  These growth curves coupled with the Offeror’s projections of potential growth from continued like investments may serve as a valuable resource for assessing the WMS requirement.  
2.0  Technical Requirements:
2.1  The WMS should support the basic job queuing, job scheduling and accounting capabilities associated with a traditional WMS operating in a multi-user environment.  The DoD also desires functionality such as advanced reservation, dynamic load balancing, job migration, allow job interdependencies including job-changing, dynamic reconfiguration, manage multiple tasks and threads, among other features.  In addition, WM across multiple systems (cross-system and/or cross-Center queuing and scheduling) located in multiple geographically distributed locations with integrated security, accounting and data management is desired.  
2.2  The overall technical functionality of the company’s software will be evaluated as a part of this pre-solicitation notice.  In response to this pre-solicitation notice, it is requested that the potential Offeror submit a Not To Exceed 4 page description of their product’s technical capabilities.  
2.3  Specific technical functionality will be specified in the actual solicitation along with a request for a more extensive description of how the Offeror’s product addresses each requirement.  In addition, the actual solicitation will require demonstration testing.
3.0 Support Requirements:
3.1  Currently the HPCMP’s allocated hardware resource suite consists of approximately 25 individual HPC systems (7 with more than 2000 processors/cores) with 8 different operating systems and 8 different interconnect technologies from 5 different HPC manufacturers.  See www.asc.hpc.mil/consolidated/hardware.php for a list of most of the currently deployed systems.  Deploying a common WMS across this diverse environment as well as addressing the continuously changing landscape of HPC technology that will be deployed over the next 10 years will require a significant capability and commitment from the Offeror to rapidly respond to this extensive and ever-changing set of requirements.  
3.2  In response to this pre-solicitation notice, please provide a company profile, the company’s business focus, existing products, level of resources (specifically dedicated to software development and testing for the WMS commercial software product) available to be responsive to this requirement, the history of the WMS product and the relationships, agreements or arrangements the company has with existing HPC OEMs for porting and supporting  the WMS product on their systems.  In addition, please outline any unique or customized management and/or technical infrastructures that would be put in place to address the DoD HPCMP requirement.  The Support Requirements response should not exceed 2 Pages.  
3.3  The actual solicitation will request similar information and include an extensive evaluation of the Offeror’s ability to develop, port, test, deploy and sustain a commercial software product that can meet the DoD HPCMP’s requirement.        
4.0  Past Performance
4.1  Given the critical role the WMS serves in the HPCMP’s 24x7 production environment and the long-term nature of this contract, it is important for the Government to reduce risk by carefully assessing the offeror’s historical track record with regard to supporting an environment like the HPCMP’s.  In response to this pre-solicitation notice, please include references to existing installations of the company’s product with information such as organization or company name, system size, operating system, communication protocols used; i.e. MPI, Open MP, SHMEM, MLP,…, the interconnect/switch technology (or product name), and the nature of the workload; i.e. many single processor jobs, a few large processor jobs dominating the system, average job size of a quarter the system size backfilled with smaller jobs,….  The Past Performance response should not exceed 2 Pages.
4.2.  The actual solicitation will request specific POC information for various installations and permission for the Government to contact these individuals.
5.0  Price
5.1  The HPCMP considers this contract to be a long term, mutually beneficial relationship with the WMS provider.  The following are important factors that the DoD HPCMP can contribute to the partnership:
a.  The surfacing technical and operational requirements that will provide a company with opportunities to enhance the commercial product to make it more competitive in the overall commercial marketplace.
b.  The highlighting of significant accomplishments of implementations on large scale systems and/or a broad-scale HPCMP-wide deployments, for example, the deployment of cross-queuing and scheduling capabilities across DoD systems and Centers. 
b.  Provide exposure of offerors’ product and its capabilities to many DoD users including government, contractor and university scientists and engineers performing computational investigations.  These users may in turn choose to separately (separate from this contract) acquire and deploy offerors’ product for systems operated under their administration.  
c.  Provide opportunities for ports of offerors’ software product to new HPC systems with a high degree of collaboration (via contractual requirements) with HPC OEMs.  This positions the offerors’ product for early commercial availability to other customers.
In turn, the HCPMP requires that the licensing model for the product and associated maintenance services be priced in the context of this long-term partnership.  In addition, it is of value for the HPCMP to have annual cost predictability independent of the outcome of the TI-deployments.  It is requested that the company provide an annual firm fixed price for sufficient commercial software products and maintenance services to meet the requirements for the 10-year life of the contract.  For purposes of this notice, request the company submit commercial product pricing, and any information regarding special pricing arrangements for potential offering to the HPCMP.  Do not submit a detailed pricing proposal.  The Pricing response should not exceed 2 pages.

<SOLNBR>N0002406R4206
<CONTACT>Tara Borntreger 202-781-3390 Timothy Starker 202-781-3944
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure main gas turbine generator (MTG) sets for the DD(X) Destroyer program on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis.  The MTG sets shall be capable of providing power for ship propulsion and for shipboard electrical power conversion for use by shipboard loads.  The MTG set shall be designed, constructed, tested and certified in accordance with the requirements of the American Bureau of Shipbuilding (ABS) Naval Vessel Rules (NVR) and the DD(X) Design, Build and Process (DB&P) specification.  The minimum output power from each MTG set shall be 36MWe at the standard rating conditions defined in ABS NVR. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitiations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Offerors may utilize either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Some technical specifications (including Attachments A and B) to this solicitation include a "Distribution Statement D" marking, meaning access is restricted to DoD and DoD contractors only.  In order to control access to these documents, they can only be received by written email request to tara.borntreger@navy.mil, with justification provided as to the parties need to know and purpose of the request.   This procurement will include a basic requirement for MTG set non-recurring engineering (detail design, interface definition, software development, certification, etc.), with five (5) FFP MTG set options, for a total of 10 MTG sets, that may be exercised during the five-year period of the contract, and associated engineering services.   This announcement supersedes the previously posted announcement N0002406R2308 for DD(X) main gas turbine engines.  No industry day is planned for this procurement.  A draft solicitation is being released with this announcement in FBO for industry review and comment.  In addition to comments on the general content of the scope and technical requirements, a review of the requirements should include the identification of cost drivers, including rough estimates of cost impact, so the Navy may conduct a trade off analysis of performance versus cost drivers prior to releasing the final RFP.

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)www.niams.nih.gov EP/MDB Branch intend to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to SciTrials, LLC 194 Weatherbee Drive, Westwood MA 02090-2141, to provide expert consultation with regards to the purchase, installation, and acceptance testing for magnetic resonance scanners for the Osteoarthritis Initiative. SciTrails LLC. has a unique experience combining MR (Magnetic Resonance) technology with clinical trails, and this vendor has broad experience in application of imaging methodologies in clinical trail development. SciTrails LLC has worked in all areas of magnetic resonance scanning from software development, to hardware installation and acceptance testing. SiTrails has experience in the identification of objective measurements for assessing errors related to performance of MR system components, which is essential for the coordinated function of MR scanners in a large clinical study. This vendor has established relationships with the NIAMS institute’s MR vendors, and is skilled in the translation of offering and protocols from one vendor’s product to the other. The vendor would also assist NIAMS with it’s mission goal of completion within a narrow time line,  preventing delay of the study start date which would have the potential to cost the Government more money. SciTrails unique set of skills, vested interest in the Osteoarthritis initiative, excellent MR experience and clinical trails experience, makes the company the best qualified for consultant. SciTrails has followed the purchase of the four 3.0 Tesla MR Systems and peripheral hardware/software since the fall of 2002 to present, and has a complete understanding of the Governments requirements to carry out a well controlled study. Duties: The imaging Technical Consultant will report to the NIAMS OAI Program Director. The primary goal of the MR imaging consultant will be to facilitate, in a smooth and timely manner, the purchase, installation and validation of four 3.0 Tesla MR Systems and peripheral hardware/software, for the longitudinal evaluation of bilateral knees and thigh muscles. The consultant would define objective measurements to assess the MR system components, which might impact the MR imaging assessment by the introduction of systematic or time varying errors. The consultant would also provide answers to technical questions, review system validation measurements and maintain a program (Technical) time line as tools with which to identify potential solutions to those issues. In addition, the consultant will ensure that the NIAMS/OAI protocols are validated in each clinical MR system, and that the sites are trained in QA (Quality Assurance)  protocol and SOP (Standard Operation Procedures).    Place of Performance: The work may be performed primarily at the Contractor’s work site. Period of Performance: The proposed period of performance is six (6) months from the date of contract award. The Government has estimated 140 hours labor hours for the performance of the tasks for this requirement. The sole source determination is based upon SciTrails excellent ability to oversee and advise on upgrades of Image Data Handling, participation in design reviews for new data handling methods for imaging, ensure Governments needs for image data portability integrity, audit trail, to insure process oversight are achieved using undated methodology, assess processes for restoring, de-identification, and scrubbing of all OAI historic images, verify audit trails for image handling, provide a unique understanding of the Government’s requirements of conducting this well-controlled study. As such, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition requirements are not applicable to this acquisition. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541690. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are required to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes; firm fixed loaded hourly price, documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Governments requirements; at least (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government’s minimum specification; and a proposed plan. The submission is due 15 days from the posting date at 08:00 a.m. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Duns & Bradstreet number (Duns), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the vendor’s business size. The vendor must also register in the Government’s Contractor Registry System, www.ccr.gov. The determination of the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a supplement to Fedbizopps sources sought synopsis PR-CI-06-10372 first posted on March 1, 2006. After evaluation of responses to the sources sought notice, the U.S. EPA hereby issues this pre-solicitation notice. The solicitation PR-CI-06-10372 will be competed using full & open competition. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be issued around April 1 and close 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the web site. Hard copies will not be distributed. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the site for amendments. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. A fixed-price contract award will be made on or around June 1, 2006 in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541710. A summary of the technical requirements, as posted in the sources sought notice are as follows:  The U.S. EPA?s National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) is currently investigating various decontamination technologies for high value building materials contaminated with Bacillus anthracis.  Current on-going studies inoculate building material coupons using a syringe (liquid droplets).  However, the likely dissemination method for B. anthracis is aerosol dispersion, thus building materials will be contaminated by dry deposition.  Liquid inoculation may yield non-comparable decontamination efficacy results to actual event decontamination efforts for porous materials such as cinder block and wood.  A system for the dry inoculation of building material coupons is needed to ensure comparable efficacy results during decontamination efforts. In response to the need for reproducibly dosing building material coupons with dry B. anthracis, the U.S. EPA/NHSRC?s Decontamination and Consequence Management Division (DCMD) is seeking to develop an aerosol deposition system for use in the systematic decontamination studies.  The system shall be able to reproducibly (within 20%) dose coupons with user defined spore loadings in the range of 102 - 108 spores per coupon (7 cm2).  The terminal velocities of these spores shall mimic those expected in an anthrax release.  The system shall be applicable to all building materials of interest, specifically: painted and unpainted cinder block, stainless steel ductwork,  industrial carpet, decorative laminate, ceiling tile, painted wallboard, and glass.  The system shall be able to dose at least twenty-five 20 mm x 35 mm coupons during a single deposition and the coupons shall be easy to remove, ensuring minimal disruption of the deposited particulate matter. As the B. anthracis innoculant is limited in availability, the deposition process must be efficient so as to conserve inocculant.  The deposition system shall be entirely contained to prevent environmental interference and contamination.  The system shall be both portable and autoclavable.   The performance of the aerosol deposition system shall be evaluated with a suitable surrogate for B. anthracis that is 1-3 ?m in diameter.  Uniformity of the aerosol deposition and reproducibility of coupon dosing shall be determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy or another comparable technology.  The ability for the system to deliver the needed concentrations of the spores to the building material coupons will be accessed here at the EPA and if the aerosol delivery system is unable to meet the specifications listed in the statement of work then the system shall be modified until it fulfills these requirements.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Dr. Jost O.L. Wendt to provide Technical Support for Evaluation of Fundamental Combustion Phenomena of the EPA's in-house Combustion Research Program for use in the U.S. EPA's Air Pollution Technology Branch (APTB).  The current NAICS code is 541710. Based on the EPA's knowledge of the Technical Support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW) there may be unique capabilities to  particular contractors/consultants.  The SOW is as follows: STATEMENT OF WORK Background:  The EPA is seeking technical support for the evaluation of fundamental combustion phenomena of EPA's in-house combustion research program.   II  Task and Deliverables: Task 1:   The contractor shall  draft a research report or paper describing efforts examining, interpreting, and relating the physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of ultra-fine coal fly ash particles, produced in the EPA's drop tube furnace reactor and/or the EPA's innovative furnace reactor. Assistance is required to  interpret these data and make recommendations for further experimental work.   Note: Collection and analysis of these samples is being performed in-house.   Task 2:  The contractor shall draft a research report or paper describing the results of a parametric investigation of an existing Selective  Catalytic Reduction (SCR) model initially designed to predict Nitric Oxide (NO) reduction by Ammonia (NH3) reagent, and recently modified to include heterogeneous kinetics of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) oxidation to Sulfur Trioxide (SO3).  Parameters of interest include gas concentrations and temperature.   Results shall investigate the effects of these parameters on the relative conversion efficiencies of NO to Nitrogen (N2) and SO2 to SO3, as well as provide recommendations of process variables that maximize NO reduction and minimize SO2 oxidation.   Task 3:  The contractor shall draft a research  report or paper describing methods of generating and characterizing ultra-fine particles with varying carbon (soot) and metal concentrations, to examine the hypothesis that the presence of carbon mediates the valence state of metals (especially transition metals) promoting reduced species, stable  free radicals, and increasing toxic effects through enhanced reactive oxidative stress.  These particles will be produced in the EPA's drop tube furnace reactor.  In addition, assistance is required to interpret the obtained data and to make recommendations for further experimental work.   Deliverable Schedule DELIVERABLE                                   Schedule Task 1:  First draft report	           10 weeks after award Task 2:  Second draft report	            8 months after award Task 3:  Third and final draft report    17 months after award However, any firm believing itself  capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed  requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is  541710.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Corps is implementing tasks from a Biological Opinion on the Missouri River which includes tasks to mechanically construct sandbar habitat for the benefit of two federally listed bird species.  Construction methods include dredging and bulldozing  of riverbed material, actions which could impact mussels if they are present.  Within the past year, one recently dead specimen has been collected for two endangered mussels, the Scaleshell mussel and the Higgins Eye mussel.  These specimens were collecte d immediately downstream from Gavins Point Dam.  Both specimens were collected outside their normal range.  The Corps has elected to draft a Biological Assessment (BA) on the implementation of the mechanically constructed sandbar project on these two feder ally listed mussels.  In order to better understand the population of these two species, the Corps will fund a survey to gain additional information prior to writing the BA.  Additionally, basic presence / absence information should be gathered for all m ussel species in order to better assess impacts of the mechanically constructed sandbar project on the native mussel community.  The contractor shall propose survey timeframes consistent with successful mussel surveys, however the desired timeframe, if fea sible, would be to begin surveying in the late summer 2006 and to complete surveys by late fall 2006.  If options are funded, the ideal situation would be for all surveys to occur during this same timeframe using multiple crews.  Diving will likely be requ ired as a part of the survey effort.  The Corps requires that divers be DOD certified [need language from diving POC].   Contractor shall demonstrate knowledge of the two federally listed species; including identification of these species, previous experience with these species, and life history information.  Contractor shall demonstrate ability and experience with large riv er mussel sampling. Contractor shall demonstrate ability and experience with sampling of rare or federally listed species.

CONTROL OF PROTEIN CONFORMATION (CPC) SOL BAA 06-19, Addendum 2, DUE:  June 29, 2006.  TECHNICAL POC:  Dr. Donald J. Leo, DARPA/DSO, Ph:  (571) 218-4939, Email:  baa06-19@darpa.mil; URL:  www.darpa.mil/dso.  Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/

DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals for the development of technologies that enable modulation of single protein affinity, activity, and selectivity through real-time control of single protein conformation. Real-time control of protein conformation will enable the development of biosensors with tunable detection characteristics, and improved countermeasures for defense against chemical and biological attack. In addition, the technologies developed under this Program will permit novel studies of the relationship between protein structure and function, thus enabling fundamental discoveries in the biological and medical sciences.

Proposals are requested for research programs that demonstrate the ability to modulate single protein affinity, activity, and selectivity through control of single protein conformation.  It is expected that each research effort will consist of an interdisciplinary team with expertise in the following technical areas: 1) Techniques for isolating single proteins of interest to chemical and biological defense, and developing assays that accurately measure single protein affinity, activity, and selectivity; 2) Techniques for real-time manipulation of single protein conformations; 3) Computational techniques that support the development of methods for real-time control of single protein conformations.


BACKGROUND

The inherent relationship between protein structure and function implies that the direct manipulation of a protein’s structure will alter its function. The ability to alter structure/function in a specific way would have application in biosensors that utilize biomolecules (e.g., antibodies) or development of biomolecule-based medical countermeasures (e.g., butyrylcholinesterase). For example, the binding affinities and selectivity of an antibody-based biosensor might be tuned or optimized in real-time to maximize detection of analytes of interest while at the same time reducing false alarms from environmental interferents. Similarly, the functional properties of an enzyme might be manipulated in real-time as part of a method for detection of chemical and biological agents or as part of a new countermeasure for chemical and biological defense.   Novel molecular processes such as ‘rapid prototyping’ of new enzyme structures and functions might also be enabled by the ability to control protein conformations in real-time. It is the goal of this Program to develop the technologies that allow this vision to be realized.

While the tertiary structure of a protein might be dictated by the primary amino acid sequence, that structure is readily affected by changes in pH, temperature, applied electric fields, or mechanical forces. Many years of ensemble studies have yielded significant information about the relationship between structure and function, and supported a large number of theoretical and computational methods that explain or rationalize that relationship. Compared to ensemble methods, single molecule measurements will provide superior temporal and spatial resolution, and new insights into the structure/function and protein folding problems.

The means for monitoring and altering the conformation of a single protein have only been recently developed. For example, single molecule microscopy now permits the visualization of fluorescent probes that monitor protein structure and conformational changes. Optical or AFM-based methods allow the direct application of forces to single proteins as they and computing;

Special Focus Areas
From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Addenda will have deadlines for submission of white papers and proposals that are different from the deadline in this BAA.  Under addenda, the technical content for a submission as well as the overall structure of the proposed effort may also differ.  DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  
Other Technical Areas
Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of DSO and are likely to be rejected.  
WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Before proposers put together a full proposal, it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state of the art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that their proposed effort will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities.  Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.
A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a white paper document in either Word or PDF format.  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA06-19@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note:  If the website is not used, then the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers and proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will receive a confirmation providing zing the Phase I results in a device or platform that might be applied to the development of novel detection methodologies or medical countermeasures. 

A Proposer’s Day Workshop will be held on May 22, 2006 in Arlington, Virginia. This day will provide an opportunity for those interested in proposing to seek clarification on the proposal and partnerships critical to programmatic success. A full Special Announcement SN06-23 detailing meeting purpose, location, registration, and other information can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING
The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.  In addition, DSO is looking for research ideas and areas that might lead to innovations in science and engineering.  To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. 
Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.   Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and may not be evaluated.  Likewise, proposals for the integration of existing technologies or development of systems will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  
Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of 12 to 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. 
This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  
TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO
This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  Please note that while the topics are organized by traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.  Regardless of the technical area, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason, white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal.  (See “White Paper Submissions” below) 
New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing and Devices:
Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 
Demonstrations of multifunctional (structure + function) materials;
Demonstrations of smart materials and structures;
Novel approaches for manufacturing and self-assembly of materials and structures;
Engineered materials and material systems with designed structure and morphology  (e.g., meta-materials);
Novel functional (e.g., magnetic, optical) materials;
Materials and enabling technologies for power generation and energy storage at all scales;
Materials and enabling technologies for efficient propulsion in all environments including space;
Materials for ultra lightweight protection from blast and non-lethal weapons;
Novel approaches to non-destructive evaluation, property/life prediction and related technologies; 
Materials and enabling technologies for measuring and controlling quantum and non-equilibrium behavior (e.g., atom interferometers; slowing, storing, and processing of light; quantum computation and communication, etc.);
Materials and rapid screening technologies for molecular-based memory fold. If real-time manipulation of protein structure/function is to be realized, these single molecule methods must be combined to achieve significant improvements in spatial and temporal resolution, supported by a computational framework that relates conformation to function. Additional innovation is required before a protein’s structure can be continuously “tuned” in real-time to achieve a desired function.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES

The goal of this Program is to develop tools that enable real-time control and manipulation of single protein conformations so that the functional characteristics of the protein might be tuned or optimized for specific purposes. 

The CPC Program will be separated into two phases.  The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate the ability to modulate the functional characteristics of a single protein through controlled changes in single protein conformation.  Depending on the successful Phase I demonstrations, the goal of Phase II will be to demonstrate that real-time control of protein conformation can be incorporated into novel detection methodologies or the development of new medical countermeasures.  

Phase I will be a research effort of not more than twelve months.  Proposals for longer than twelve months will be accepted but only with appropriate justification. The Phase I milestones are:

1)	Demonstrate a 10:1 variation in single protein affinity through real-time control of single protein conformation.
2)	Demonstrate a 10:1 variation in the relative affinities (i.e., selectivity) for a group of five representative molecules that bind to the protein. 
3)	Demonstrate a 10:1 variation in single protein activity through real-time control of single protein conformation.  This milestone may not be relevant for certain types of proteins under investigation, e.g., antibodies which do not exhibit catalytic activity.

Phase II is expected to be a research effort of between twelve and eighteen months.  The Phase II milestones will be determined by the results of the Phase I effort and the specific device application that is proposed.  

To realize the program vision and meet the Phase I milestones, each research effort requires performers with expertise in all of the following areas:

1) Techniques for isolating single proteins of interest to chemical and biological defense, and developing assays that accurately measure single protein affinity, activity, and selectivity 
Experimental techniques for isolating single proteins for the purpose of characterizing their structure and function are required.  Examples include tethering of molecules to substrates, or the use of optical and electrical traps to immobilize single protein macromolecules.  Progress in the program will be assessed by measuring the affinity, activity, and selectivity of single proteins, therefore methods for single protein measurements must be clearly defined.  Ensemble methods are not deemed to be useful for this program.  We are specifically interested in controlling single proteins that enable new advances in the detection of chemical and biological agents, or the development of new countermeasures for chemical and biological attack.    

2) Development of techniques for real-time manipulation of protein conformations
Techniques for manipulating the conformations of single proteins are required.  These include, but are not limited to, the application of mechanical, optical, and electrical stimuli to the single protein for the purpose of changing conformational state.  Alteration of the thermal and chemical environment to effect conformation change is potentially of interest (e.g., temperature change, pH change) but is not viewed as a practical method of implementing real-time control.   Relevant engineering parameters, such as speed of response, spatial resolution, and repeatability must be defined.

In addition to techniques for manipulating conformational changes in proteins, techniques for directly measuring the conformational state of a single protein are required to implement control.  These include, but are not limited to, fluorescent techniques and FRET-based techniques that enable real-time measurement of proximity between probes bound to a protein.  Novel methods of imaging that have the potential for improved spatial and temporal resolution are also of interest.  Concepts for novel hardware, such as advanced detectors and CCD arrays, and novel signal processing methods for real-time measurement, are also of interest if they clearly define how they will improve the state of the art in single protein measurements. Technical details associated with these techniques, such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution, repeatability, and measurement record length, must be defined.  Indirect methods of measuring protein conformation, such as the measurement of ionic currents with a patch clamp, are not viewed as useful for this program unless they are coupled with a single protein measurement.


3) Computational techniques that support the development of methods for real-time control of single protein conformations.
Computational approaches for modeling the conformational change in proteins that are relevant to chemical and biological countermeasures are required to correlate measurements with a physical understanding of the processes.  These include, but are not limited to, normal mode analyses of protein crystal structure; eigenvalue-eigenvector analyses of protein structure; and methods for predicting the global and local response of a single protein to applied stimuli.  Of particular importance are computational approaches that predict the relationship between conformation of a single protein and the protein’s affinity, activity, and selectivity, and computational approaches that can predict the changes in conformational state under the action of external stimuli.  Coupling computational models with classical and modern control theory is deemed vital to the development of this program.    


PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

As described in BAA 06-19, proposals shall consist of two volumes: Technical and Cost.  Only full proposals are being accepted under this addendum.  Follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at: http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm. 

Each technical proposal must have a clearly defined research team and management approach. The research team must incorporate people with expertise in all three research areas listed above, and the proposal must clearly define how the team will work together to achieve the program goals.  One of the team members must be designated the Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator will be responsible for coordinating the team and demonstrating the project milestones. 

Proposals that address only a subset of the research areas listed above or do not contain a clear indication of the Principal Investigator and Management Approach will not be considered for funding.

The technical volume of the research proposal must consist of the following sections:

1)	Phase I Technical Approach
a.	Definition of a method for isolating single proteins and measuring the affinity, selectivity, and, if applicable, the activity.
b.	Definition of a technique for manipulating and characterizing single protein conformation.
c.	Computational approach for correlating conformational changes in single proteins with functional properties.

2)	Phase I milestones:  Define a set of interim milestones.  The final milestones must include those defined above for the Phase I program.
3)	Research Team: Clearly define the expertise of the individual team members and how their expertise relates to the research areas defined in the technical approach.
4)	Management Approach: Define a single Principal Investigator who will coordinate the team and be responsible for demonstrating the project milestones.
5)	Phase II Concept:  Discuss a concept for utilia log number and both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a full proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their white paper to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding.  Proposers may recommend a program manager to review their proposals based on prior discussions and/or information on the DSO website.  Please note, this recommendation and any additional feedback provided is for the benefit of the proposer and following these recommendations is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.

In the Statement of Work Under Performance Objective 2- We will be writing, designing and, in some cases, translating  materials, including fact sheets and other outreach materials. In terms of preparing a cost quote, since we don't know the magnitude of publications to be produced, or number of languages into which some or all publications will be translated, I assume we estimate the LOE for the various services  to be provided (writing, editing, design, translation) to the best of our ability and provide an explanation in the budget notes. Is that correct? See Question 7.

Subject: Request for Participation in Evaluating Equipment for Detecting Explosive Devices in Unattended Packages by Transit Police Officers

On behalf of the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Science and Technology CounterMeasures Test Beds program (DHS S&T CMTB), Sandia National Laboratories is requesting information concerning commercial or near-commercial hand-held/portable equipment that can be used by Transit Police Officers to investigate unattended items (left behind bags, objects on tracks, etc.) for explosives on commuter rail and light passenger rail (metros and subways) systems.  The Transit Police Officer will employ non-intrusive systems such as portable x-ray, trace detectors, etc. to evaluate unattended items for explosives (TNT, RDX, PETN, Nitro or Ammonia Nitrate base, etc.) that could be used as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in commuter and passenger rail environments. DHS is investigating whether the use of such equipment to evaluate unattended items by Transit Police Officers will decrease incidents where rail stations have to be evacuated and closed awaiting the bomb squad’s investigation.  In order to participate in this evaluation, equipment manufacturers must be willing to loan equipment to the DHS under a no-cost purchase order or similar agreement.  Equipment must be available for evaluation for approximately 8-12 weeks beginning May 1, 2006.  Equipment manufacturers must also be willing to provide technical support and training regarding system operations.
Please submit information in the form of a one-page white paper to:
Linda K. Groves
Sandia National Laboratories
lkgrove@sandia.gov
White papers must include the following information:
• Contact information for system manufacturer
• Physical description of the system (including a picture)
• Operational description of the system (including screening   time, ease of set-up, the procedure and mechanism for detection, ease of operation without continued practice, ability to classify type of explosives)
• Description of system maturity (laboratory prototype versus commercially available product)
• Description of safety measures needed to be taken during device operation to protect Transit Police Operator from object being investigated (i.e. safe stand-off distance).
• Approximate cost per unit and maintenance costs
RESPONSES MUST BE IN OUR POSSESSION BEFORE 5:00 PM MST,4-21-06.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a follow up request to RFI W15P7T-05-R-S017 from July 2005.  The Product Manager  Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) is conducting a market research to determine night vision drivers sensor system technology avail ability for possible use on Army Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (TWV). The Government is looking for a 'sensor system', meaning an imaging sensor, display, and vehicle integration kit. The imaging sensor can be mounted at any point on the vehicle that allows th e driver to see the road ahead.  The drivers display must be located inside the cab, and must not interfere with normal driving functions. Key performance parameters include:  (1) The complete system average unit production cost (AUPC) is $6,000 in Calendar Year 2006 dollars for a qty of 2500 systems.  For planning purposes, the total number of systems to be procured is 8849 over the 5 years.  The complete system unit cost incl udes all components to be delivered (including transport case) and installed (but does not include the installation costs) on medium and heavy TWVs to include armored variants in accordance with the following preliminary requirements by vehicle type:  (the se numbers are for planning purposes only). 	FY07	FY08	FY09	FY10	FY11 HEMTT	1428	1220	998	1244	1201 PLS	681	244	353	247	51 HET	484	127	240	331	0 TOTAL	2593	1591	1591	1822	1252 (HEMTT  Heavy Extended Mobility Tactical Truck, PLS  Palletized Loading System, HET  Heavy Equipment Transporter)  (2) The capability for the drivers viewing system shall allow the driver to see and drive the vehicle at speeds from 29-35 MPH on primary roads, 22-25 MPH on secondary roads and 8-9 MPH on cross country terrain during periods of darkness and other degrade d visibility conditions (such as smoke, fog, haze, rain, sand, etc).   (3) System shall be removable by the vehicle operator and installed into the basic mounting kit of another vehicle within 20 minutes (threshold). Key parameters are: (A) Sensor/Camera: Can be any type (i.e. Infrared (IR), Image Intensification (I2), Gated I2, active and passive Short Wave Infrared (SWIR), etc., (B) Display: allows driver to maintain a relaxed driving position while viewing the image  and allows for brightness adjustments during day/night operation, (C) The drivers viewer sensor system may use vehicle power, (D) Single, modular designed A-kit that fits all vehicle types is desired, but minimal changes in A-kits between vehicle types i s accepted.          A Draft Performance Specification (DRAFT DVE Light PRF Spec) is provided to offer a more detailed description of the Governments sensor system expectations.  Vendors should feel free to ask questions or submit comments pertaining to the draft performance specification. The current Government schedule of key activities for this effort is as follows (these dates are for informational purposes only and are subject to change at any time): 	(1) Request For Proposal (RFP) release  3rd Quarter 2006 	(2) Government receipt of proposals and bid samples  1.5 months after RFP release (2 bid samples per vendor submittal, bid samples are expected to be at least 80-90% compliant to the RFP Performance Specification and data supporting vendor compliance tes ting is expected as part of the submittal.  The Government will use the bid samples to perform laboratory and field performance testing as well as laboratory system characterization.)  	(3) Contract award  4 months after RFP release 	(4) Delivery of first fully qualified Production lot  6 months after contact award For planning purposes the production quantities by month are as follows:  first month deliveries (first lot) - 100 complete units, second months deliveries - 200 complete units, third months deliveries -  300 complete units, forth months deliveries - 400 c omplete units, fifth month, six month, and seventh month deliveries - 500 complete units in each month. In order to assi st the Government in conducting this market research, vendors are asked to provide, as part of their response to this RFI, cost/performance trade-offs against items in the draft performance specification to meet the cost target.  In particular, the Governm ent is interested in understanding the cost savings associated with a reduction in system sensitivity and the cost savings associated with a reduction in reliability.  Other cost/performance trade-offs should include compliance testing criteria outlined in  the draft specification provided.  Vendors are asked to list assumptions made when conducting performance analyses.  As a reminder it is the interest of the Government to understand the best possible complete system capability that the vendor can provide meeting the complete system unit cost identified above ($6,000).  Cost estimates must separately price all vehicle integration costs and component costs and all respondents must address any/all long lead items/parts, and lead time to first unit deliveries.   It is the intent of the Government to provide vendors access to example vehicles and vehicle drawings in the future prior to any additional requests from the Government beyond this RFI. Additionally, as part of the RFI response, the Government asks for each submitter to review the schedule dates above and provide comments for the submitters capability to meet these dates.  Also submitters are asked to provide a list of dates the submitte r could make on a compressed schedule.   Submitters are asked to provide an explanation in the form of a justification for any time period they believe can be shortened from the current Government baseline above.  All system vulnerabilities must be identified and explained.  These vulnerabilities include susceptibility to enemy countermeasures while performing operations.  For evaluation purposes, each potential source is requested to provide a brief description of work previously or currently being performed, which specifically demonstrates the contractor's ability to successfully satisfy the requirement described herein. Firms are also invited to submit any literature, brochures, or references necessary to support claims of being able to meet or exceed the requirement. Submittals shall be provided by email no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 27 April 2006 to Joseph Manganaro at joseph.manganaro@us.army.mil.  Hard copy submittals are not required. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for B id (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this sources sought will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this sources sought or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contr actor input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The informati on provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.

<DESC>NASA is initiating a long-term activity to develop a global space exploration strategy.  A series of activities are planned in 2006 to gain a better understanding of the role that human and robotic exploration and development of a sustained human presence on the moon plays in supporting a broad exploration strategy that includes Mars and other destinations.  As part of this process, NASA’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) is seeking through this Request For Information (RFI), ideas on activities that could be pursued on the moon as part of an integrated global exploration strategy. The goal is to collect a wide variety of ideas and perspectives for the lunar exploration component of the exploration strategy.	Eventually a robust, worldwide strategy for exploration of the moon will be developed using information from many sources, including inputs provided through this solicitation. Guidelines 1.	Ideas should be expressed in English as achievable lunar exploration objectives, over a 25 year horizon, which address one or more of the following key elements of the exploration strategy:       • Lunar exploration activities that are an integral part of a broader exploration strategy that encompasses Mars and other destinations;       • Lunar robotic activities that collect key strategic information and develop key capabilities to enable and enhance human exploration;        • Lunar activities that enable humans to live and work productively on the moon, including developing and using lunar resources;        • Activities that enable opportunities for international collaboration through merging of common interests in respective strategic plans for exploration;        • Characterization of opportunities for science investigations on the moon;        • Activities that can enable lunar commerce;        • Activities that can engage the general public in lunar exploration.  2.	Each objective should be documented by providing the information requested in the Exploration Strategy Product document posted on the RFI web site, see Paragraph 4 for URL.  The type of information requested includes summary information defining the objective, any dependencies it has on other objectives, architecture and operations assumptions associated with meeting the objective, intermediate milestones, and associated key decision points.  In cases where the submission identifies multiple objectives, additional information regarding the relative time phasing of these various objectives and the general strategic themes that they represent, can also be provided.  Additionally, submissions may provide some indication of issues/constraints/enablers in areas such as technology, policy, legal, or programmatics. 3.	Viable responses should be consistent with generally accepted laws of physics.  Innovative objectives including novel systems concepts are welcome, but should be consistent with advances that are reasonably achievable within a 25 year horizon. 4.	All responses should be delivered electronically by completing and submitting the Exploration Strategy Product form located on the RFI web site:	    http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&stack=push      . Each submission will receive an electronic notification of a successful upload.  All submissions must be received by May 12, 2006 at 5:00 p.m. EDT. 5.

<SUBJECT>A--Development of System for Dry Inoculation of Building Material Coupons
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-06-10372
<RESPDATE>031006
<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: bowers.joshua@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. EPA hereby issues this Sources Sought synopsis in search of any vendor capable to complete a project entitled ?Development of a system for dry inoculation of building material coupons. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice or to a contract for services. This is a market survey for written information only, to ascertain whether the services contemplated for this procurement can be set aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541710, the size standard of which is 500 employees. The U.S. EPA?s National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) is currently investigating various decontamination technologies for high value building materials contaminated with Bacillus anthracis.  Current on-going studies inoculate building material coupons using a syringe (liquid droplets).  However, the likely dissemination method for B. anthracis is aerosol dispersion, thus building materials will be contaminated by dry deposition.  Liquid inoculation may yield non-comparable decontamination efficacy results to actual event decontamination efforts for porous materials such as cinder block and wood.  A system for the dry inoculation of building material coupons is needed to ensure comparable efficacy results during decontamination efforts. In response to the need for reproducibly dosing building material coupons with dry B. anthracis, the U.S. EPA/NHSRC?s Decontamination and Consequence Management Division (DCMD) is seeking to develop an aerosol deposition system for use in the systematic decontamination studies.  The system shall be able to reproducibly (within 20%) dose coupons with user defined spore loadings in the range of 102 - 108 spores per coupon (7 cm2).  The terminal velocities of these spores shall mimic those expected in an anthrax release.   The system shall be applicable to all building materials of interest, specifically: painted and unpainted cinder block, stainless steel ductwork, industrial carpet, decorative laminate, ceiling tile, painted wallboard, and glass.  The system shall be able to dose at least twenty-five 20 mm x 35 mm coupons during a single deposition and the coupons shall be easy to remove, ensuring minimal disruption of the deposited particulate matter. As the B. anthracis innoculant is limited in availability, the deposition process must be efficient so as to conserve inocculant.  The deposition system shall be entirely contained to prevent environmental interference and contamination.  The system shall be both portable and autoclavable.   The performance of the aerosol deposition system shall be evaluated with a suitable surrogate for B. anthracis that is 1-3 ?m in diameter.  Uniformity of the aerosol deposition and reproducibility of coupon dosing shall be determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy or another comparable technology.  The ability for the system to deliver the needed concentrations of the spores to the building material coupons will be accessed here at the EPA and if the aerosol delivery system is unable to meet the specifications listed in the statement of work then the system shall be modified until it fulfills these requirements.   Interested parties shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their experience in this field. Capability statements shall not exceed 3 pages and standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Reference PR-CI-06-10372. Again, this statement is for information purposes only.  Interested parties shall submit their capability statement to the Contracting Officer via email at bowers.joshua@epa.gov no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time, Friday, March 10, 2006.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires services for a two year project on  mathematical treatment and experimental development of indoor environment surface chemistry.  

NIOSH is interested in understanding the influence surface chemistry has on occupant exposure in indoor work environments.  

NIOSH is investigating the chemistry of indoor environments to reduce worker exposure to potentially harmful pollutants by 1) identifying the volatile reaction products of the surface chemistry of common cleaning compounds such as fN-pinene, £G3-carene and ƒÑ-terpineol, 2) quantifying surface reaction product emission rates of common cleaning compounds, 3) using the identification and 4) emission rates to reveal surface chemical mechanisms and quantify kinetics that can then be used to extrapolate emission rates into occupational settings and estimate exposure.  

The research results will be used to derive new mathematical models of the indoor work environment, assess worker exposure, highlight fundamental chemical reaction mechanisms and develop new indoor surface sampling methods.   Other outcomes of this work will be contributions to international standards for the Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC) which are commonly used in Europe to determine regulatory emissions from building materials.  This may include meetings with researchers at the NIOSH location in Morgantown, WV, and/or with researchers at University of Missouri-Rolla in Rolla, MO.  

Knowledge of gas-phase chemical deposition, mass transfer coefficients, surface emissions and reactant induced surface chemistry of volatile organic compounds as well as developing mathematical models to accurately describe these indoor surface phenomena are essential to accurately describing the influence surfaces (floors, walls, furniture) have on indoor occupational exposure.  Investigating the fundamental chemistry of coated surfaces is one of the methods to improve this understanding.  

The contractor required for this work must be an expert in the mathematical treatment and experimental development of indoor environment surface chemistry.

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party may identify themselves to the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, Reference: 000HCC34-2006-28037, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to University of Missouri-Rolla without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families, Division of Child and Family Development, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management is providing the following sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) to conduct the work necessary to  continue the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW).  NSCAW is the first nationally representative, longitudinal study to examine in detail the outcomes for those children and families that come into contact with the child welfare system and to identify key variables that contribute to those outcomes.  Currently, the NSCAW project is being conducted through a contract to RTI International; begun in 1997, the project has conducted four waves of data collection from a sample of 5501 children, drawn from 92 primary sampling units (PSUs) across the U.S.,  who were the subjects of investigation by Child Protective Services between late 1999 and early 2001 for reports of maltreatment.   An additional sample of 727 children was selected from those who had been in foster care for one year during the sample enrollment period, in the same PSUs.  Data were collected at baseline and at three follow-up waves (12 months, 18 months, and 36 months post-investigation).  A fifth wave of data collection will be completed in 2006.  Further information about the NSCAW project can be found at http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/opre/abuse_neglect/nscaw/index.html . 

The NSCAW work will be conducted over a five-year period.  The contractor is expected to manage all aspects of the study, including completing the study design, defining the sample, defining constructs and measures, preparing documents for obtaining approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for data collection, obtaining approvals from internal and external Internal Review Boards (IRBs), and assessing the feasibility of proposed field work strategies.  The contractor shall complete preparations for field work (including obtaining cooperation from 100 local child welfare agencies for participation and training an extensive field staff), recruit and train field staff, locate families, obtain informed consent, and conduct data collection.  The contractor shall be responsible for locating and tracking a national sample of approximately 5000-6000 children over the course of the study’s designated time period using a variety of data collection methods and will revise the design and measures as appropriate at each data collection point, complete data analyses, and prepare the data from each data collection for archiving as public use data sets.  Data analysis will include state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical models, growth curve analysis, structural equation modeling, attrition models, and survival models.  The contractor shall report their findings to policy, science and practice communities, including publishing in professional journals and presenting at professional meetings.

The contract will require longitudinal data collection from (1) children in the child welfare system, (2) their caregivers, (3) their caseworkers, (4) other agency personnel, and (5) review of administrative records.  It is expected that at a minimum, two rounds of face-to-face interviews will be conducted with children, caregivers, and caseworkers.  In addition to interviews, standardized assessments of educational, emotional, behavioral, and social functioning will be conducted with children.  Data may also be collected from schools and from service providers outside the child welfare system.  In addition to the face-to-face interviews noted above, other activities may be used as supplements to the interview data or to facilitate data collection at more frequent intervals (including telephone follow-ups, mailed questionnaires, record reviews).  Careful tracking of families and children over time to minimize attrition is an essential component for the success of this study.

Participating children and families will be those who have had contact with the child welfare system (i.e., upon investigation of abuse or neglect or some other entry mechanism into the system).  Obtaining child welfare agency participation is likely to present substantial challenges.  Local agencies are highly variable in terms of the resources that they have available for participation in research activities, the policies and procedures that govern whether they will agree to participate, whether they will allow and facilitate access to the children and families served by the system, and as to what type of consent procedures are required for child and family participation.  The availability of staff or consultants with extensive knowledge of state and local child welfare agencies will be necessary to facilitate this process.  Likewise, obtaining participation from an extremely high-risk and vulnerable group of children and families, will require considerable skill and resources.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  The minimum contractor requirements are:  (1) In-depth expertise of the issues related to the child welfare population, including issues around service delivery, service integration, child development, and family functioning, and extensive knowledge of state and local child welfare agencies; (2) expertise in sampling and survey research, as well as several of the following areas: research or evaluation study design and implementation, including experience conducting large, multi-site, longitudinal national studies; experience in working on research or evaluation projects that focus on program outcome assessment issues, as well as educational and social service programs which address these outcome issues;  3) capacity to collect data at multiple timepoints for as many as 20,000 respondents, spread over as many as 100 separate locations across the nation; experience conducting on-site research in social service settings; experience conducting on-site interviews with program staff and parents, as well as experience conducting in-depth and comprehensive assessments of children and families from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations; research experience entailing social services data collection strategies; 4) experience with the analysis and integration of data with varying levels of quality from multiple sources; expertise in using state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical models, growth curve analysis, structural equation modeling, attrition models, survival models; expertise in demography and the analysis of population distributions; writing reports for both a research and policy making audience; and report preparation; 5) expertise related to multi-site, longitudinal research methodology including the statistical approaches and issues related to analyzing very large (and sometimes incomplete) multi-site data sets and expertise related to outcome assessment issues associated with child welfare and related programs, as well as demographic and service delivery trends affecting this population; (6) experience managing a national data collection effort that requires participation by multiple local agencies and expertise in identifying the ethical and legal issues that may arise in the course of collecting data on high risk populations, and the skills and resources required to address such issues;  availability of an internal IRB to review the data collection plan, as well as experience in dealing with obtaining approvals from multiple external IRBs at the state and local level;  (7) experience in designing data collection strategies, including expertise in selecting data collection strategies from among the various alternatives, based on theoretical and methodological support for each specific data collection strategy (e.g., psychometric issues, previous use of techniques, and relevance for the population from low-income backgrounds and from multiple cultural and linguistic groups); (8) adequate computer/statistical resources, including ability to use CAPI and CATI data collection technologies, access to internet, and the institutional capacity to process, analyze and archive all data, including the capability to support the performance of state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques; (9) capability to conduct large-scale  training programs to prepare field interviewers to conduct direct assessments of children from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations; (10) experience in the recruitment, training, supervision and management of nationally dispersed field staff, particularly in the areas of client interviewing and child assessments;  demonstrated capacity for efficient data collection and quality control associated with multi-site longitudinal studies; ability to quickly mobilize a national cadre of skilled data collectors; experience collecting, processing and analyzing large quantities of data; experience preparing data sets for public use; and preparing written reports for Federal, State, and local agencies; and (11) expertise in collecting, analyzing, and reporting information for purposes of successful dissemination to science and practice communities, including publishing in professional journals and presenting at professional meetings;  and 12) experience with documenting and archiving data sets for secondary analysis, knowledge and expertise in the confidentiality issues surrounding data archiving, and experience with end-user technical assistance in accessing and using complex data sets.

<SUBJECT>A -- TYPE 1 DIABETES (T1D) CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTI-CD3 & EXENATIDE ON LOSS OF INSULIN PRODUCTION IN PATIENTS WITH RECENT ONSET T1D AND INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK
<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration

TYPE 1 DIABETES TRIALNET MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF ANTI-CD3 AND EXENATIDE ON LOSS OF INSULIN PRODUCTION IN PATIENTS WITH RECENT ONSET TYPE 1 DIABETES AND IN INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYPE 1 DIABETES

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaborations with Industry to provide anti-CD3 for use in a NIH-sponsored multi-center trial to evaluate the effects of anti-CD3 and exenatide on the loss of insulin production in patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in individuals at high-risk for the development of T1DM.

INTRODUCTION:  

The TrialNet anti-CD3 plus exenatide study will evaluate the effects of this combination of agents on preservation of insulin production in patients with new-onset T1DM and in individuals at high-risk for the development of T1DM.  The combination of these two treatment approaches may inhibit the autoimmune response responsible for beta cell destruction (anti-CD3) while improving beta  cell mass (Exenatide). Unlike the currently approved treatments of T1DM which involve replacement of insulin, the combination of these two agents may have a significant and lasting impact on the natural history and clinical course of T1DM in which the primary pathologic abnormality is destruction of insulin producing Beta cells. TrialNet hypothesizes that the combination of an immune tolerizing therapy with one that may improve beta cell mass will result in substantial clinical benefit for subjects with or at high-risk for T1DM.  

The initial TrialNet anti-CD3 plus exenatide trial will include patients with new-onset T1DM and consists of a safety pilot phase followed by a full-scale study.  The safety pilot phase is being performed to assess the safety and feasibility of anti-CD3 plus exenatide for the treatment of individuals with new-onset type 1 diabetes.  It is a 2-arm, multi-center, randomized, open-labeled, controlled clinical trial.  Thirty patients will be recruited over a 6-month period to receive either intervention or control treatment.  The intervention group will receive a 14-day course of anti-CD3 combined with one year of exenatide administration and intensive diabetes management.  The control group will receive intensive diabetes management alone.  The full-scale study will assess the safety, efficacy, and mode of action of anti-CD3 plus exenatide for preservation of residual insulin production in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes.  This 4-arm, multi-center, randomized, open-labeled, controlled clinical trial will enroll 130 additional participants over a 2-year period.  In the full-scale study, subjects will be randomized to receive either anti-CD3 alone, exenatide alone, a combination of anti-CD3 plus exenatide, or intensive diabetes management alone.  Both phases will include participants 8*-45 years of age (*once sufficient data has been obtained on older participants).  They must have at least one diabetes-associated autoantibody and must have been diagnosed within T1DM for less than or equal to 3 months.  An additional study using the same treatment regimen will be initiated in individuals at high-risk for the development of T1DM sometime during the full-scale study in new-onset T1DM patients.

STUDY GOALS:  The goal of the pilot study is to determine whether treatment of new-onset T1DM with anti-CD3 plus exenatide is feasible and has an acceptable adverse event profile.  The primary goal of the full-scale study is to compare beta cell function (stimulated C-peptide response) in the treatment versus control groups.  The subsequent trial, which will be performed in high-risk individuals, will assess time to development of T1DM.

REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTION:  Potential Industry Collaborators must meet the following criteria:
1.	Must agree to have their anti-CD3 preparation used in the above-mentioned TrialNet-developed protocols which will be conducted by TrialNet and will have data collection and analysis performed by the TrialNet Coordinating Center (TNCC).
2.	Must be able to assure TrialNet that sufficient anti-CD3 will be made available to complete the proposed TrialNet studies, even if development of the anti-CD3 is voluntarily interrupted or halted (this would not apply in the event of a safety issue that leads to termination of the program under the guidance of the FDA).
3.	Must agree to provide anti-CD3 supplies according to a mutually agreed upon schedule. 
4.	Must provide Certificates of Analysis, product labeling, stability dating and storage conditions for each lot of anti-CD3 to be used in the TrialNet study. 
5.	Must be prepared to supply their anti-CD3 preparation for immediate use in the TrialNet new-onset T1DM trial and subsequently for use in the T1DM trial in individuals at high-risk for the development of T1DM.  
6.	Must provide IND sponsor of the TrialNet study with cross-reference access to a US FDA filing that contains the chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for the anti-CD3 drug substance and drug product.
7.	The proposed anti-CD3 preparation must have been tested in Phase I trials in humans.
8.	Dosing and Pharmacokinetic data from human studies must be provided. 
9.	Adverse event profile from human studies must be provided. 
10.	Must agree to share (with TrialNet) all safety data from other studies involving their anti-CD3 preparation as well as relevant efficacy data from other studies (updated Investigator Brochure, etc).
11.	Must agree to have their anti-CD3 preparation used in conjunction with exenatide, the other study agent.  
12.	If monitoring is required by the Collaborator so that the data conform to FDA requirements for a New Drug Application (NDA), Collaborator must agree to have such clinical site monitoring coordinated by the TNCC, and must agree to pay for such monitoring.

Potential Collaborators should submit a brief capability statement to the contact person noted below.

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the "Collaborator Capability Statements" received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed three (3) pages of narrative (not including appendices) and should address all selection criteria (for the particular anti-CD3 preparation being proposed) in addition to the following items:  (1) name of agent; (2) stage of clinical investigation with the anti-CD3 agent, including whether phase I, IIa, IIb, and III trials are completed or underway and the number of subjects and dose administered in each; (3) dosing data in humans; (4) adverse event profile in humans; (5) willingness to have the agent used in combination with another agent, exenatide.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA Collaborator.

<SUBJECT>D -- SBInet Advisory Multi-Step Process
<DESC>Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the Department of Homeland Security, Customs & Border Protection’s (CBP) SBInet – Advisory Multi-Step Process.

Customs and Border Protection intends to issue a Request for Proposal that may result in the award of an indefinite deliver/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This contract is to provide services, products and management needed to ensure accomplishment of the CBP SBInet Initiative, to achieve border control through the optimum mix of staffing, infrastructure and technology.  The focus of SBInet is securing the land borders at and between the Ports of Entry (POEs) of the United States of America and establishing a Common Operational Picture (COP) within DHS.  The Solicitation/Request for Proposal number has not yet been assigned.  All documents applicable to this special notice will be available via the Internet at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/contrtact/sbi_net/.  
 
Interested parties are invited to respond to this Special Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.  This method also correlates with use of a Statement of Objectives for performance-based support under a single integration support contract for CBP’s multi-year SBInet Program.  Telephone requests for this Special Notice cannot be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1 of the Advisory Multi-Step Process, described below.  The anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) (Phase 2) release date is March 31, 2006.  Please ensure the reference number and program title (U.S. Customs & Border Protection – Secure Border Initiative, SBInet) is referenced on all correspondence.  


ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS: 
This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.  Phase 1 consists of the submission of Vendor Capability Statements, agency evaluations of the capability statements, and subsequent advisory notifications to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.  To preserve the integrity of the on-going solicitation, the government will not entertain any phone calls, emails, questions, or communication of any kind during this phase.  Phase 2 consists of the solicitation, proposal evaluation, and award.

Phase 1 – Submission of Vendor Capability Statements, Agency Evaluations and Advisory Notifications  
This phase includes submissions of Vendor Capability Statements the SBInet Relevant Experience Questionnaire, followed by CBP’s assessment and the advisory notifications.  

A. Submission of Vendor Capability Statements:
Interested vendors are invited to submit Capability Statements describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements and the accompanying Relevant Experience Questionnaire forms must be submitted via email to SBInet@dhs.gov no later than Tuesday, March 14, 2006, 9:00 am EST.  Please ensure the RFP number and program title (U.S. Customs & Border Protection – Secure Border Initiative, SBInet) is referenced in the subject line of the email.  

Responding to a performance-based solicitation, especially one utilizing a SOO that seeks contractor-developed solutions requires a significant effort on the part of contractors to propose to the government.  It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the agency's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches and solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the agency’s intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solution thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this performance-based contract award are asked to carefully review the attached SBInet Program Background, and Capability Statements and Criteria documents to make a realistic self-assessment as to their potential viability.  

B.  Agency Evaluations:
The Vendor Capability Statements will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statements Instructions below.  The agency will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the vendors who provide submissions.  There will be no opportunity for questions during this phase.  

C.  Advisory Notifications:
CPB will issue advisory notifications stating that the respondent will either be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or, based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  As explained in FAR 15.202(b), Advisory Multi-Step Process, “….The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.”

Phase 2 – Solicitation, Proposal Evaluation and Award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract 
This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed technical and cost proposals, management plans, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify initial (or possibly sample) tasks to be completed by the selected offeror following contract award.  To ensure that the government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors will be provided an opportunity to participate in a “due diligence” period where prospective offerors meet with key agency representatives to learn as much as possible about the SBInet program, mission goals, and requirements in order to develop a competitive solution.

<SUBJECT>A -- TRUST RFI Announcement
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide details about a possible future DARPA program so that industry feedback can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Responders are invited to provide comment on any or all of the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation in order to ensure that every effort is made to address this important problem. Responses to this request may or may not be incorporated within any future BAA announcement. In order to comply with scheduling priorities, responders are asked to provide feedback with 10 calendar days to jonathan.breedlove.ctr@darpa.mil. The attachment to this announcement contains details of the scope of technical efforts.

In the future, DARPA may solicit innovative research proposals to advance the science and technology for ensuring that integrated circuits can be trusted regardless of their origin and fabrication process.  Research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. 

Background and Scope

Largely because of global economic pressures, fabrication of advanced integrated circuits is migrating to foreign foundries.  In addition, business models are increasingly driven by commercial, rather then military, demand. Dedicated facilities cannot provide the performance, variety and volume of microchips that the DOD needs. These trends have raised concern regarding US weapons systems reliance on high performance microchips and potential vulnerabilities to these systems caused by malicious manipulation of hardware and software processes that might render these vital systems inoperable at some future time. This situation is true for both ASIC and COTS parts. 

Furthermore, there are issues with protecting intellectual property and military secrets as they are often embedded in the design of microcircuits, and the details of this design are often needed by the manufacturer in the fabrication process. 

Finally, there are also issues associated with protecting intellectual property and military secrets after the systems are deployed,  especially in circumstances where systems and components are lost, captured or are no longer under US control and subject to reverse engineering over a sustained period of time. 

This new DARPA initiative is being considered to address the above issues and others that have been identified in the DSB study on High Performance Microchip Supply [http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-02-HPMS_Report_Final.pdf]. The report addresses design, the use of advanced design tools, fabrication, packaging, testing, and monitoring of high performance IC’s within critical systems and subsystems. Specific areas of interest to DARPA include TRUST, Information Leakage and Anti-Tamper; although the primary interest is TRUST. DARPA will also engage in a Metrics-for-TRUST task focused on measuring the value of DARPA investments in novel technologies. To be clear, DARPA is only interested in issues related to TRUSTed Integrated Circuits and is not interested in proposals pertaining to issues concerning printed circuit boards or the general area of malicious software.

Interested organizations are encouraged to obtain the attachment to this announcement and provide a response, within 10 calendar days to jonathan.breedlove.ctr@darpa.mil,  with suggested technical scope modification and/or additions. This request is being made so that DARPA, if it decides to go forward with a BAA, can have the benefit of this industry feedback to better assure that responses are focused on the most critical technologies to address important problems.

Evaluation Criteria

The Government anticipates awarding a task order to the vendor whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described below.  Delivery & Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Award may be made other than the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  Price proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described in Section B.

The Government, at its discretion, may award this task without discussions.

Vendors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this proposal is based.  All assumptions (both technical and price) shall be included in the proposal.

A.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors.

 	Past Performance
  	Delivery  
	Price     				

Assumptions, Conditions, and Exceptions will be reviewed for acceptability and potential impact on information provided in the task order proposal.

	1.  Delivery

	The Government is seeking to determine the speed of delivery.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of the delivery proposal from the vendor. 

	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE

	If the vendor has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the sub-factors below, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this SOW.  The past performance information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.

	Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.
	Past performance will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the SOW.
	Each proposal is required to describe a minimum of two but not more than five prior relevant projects that have been completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this SOW.   Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
	Past performance is relevant to the support required for the task order.  Deliverables must meet contract requirements technical excellence, timing, budgeting and report accuracy.  Management must be effective with flexible and responsive staffing with no performance problems or deficiencies that impact task quality, time or cost.  Vendor must meet all requirements in overall satisfaction to end-users.

B.  PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION.  Vendors’ price proposal will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness.  Vendors’ technical and price proposals will be evaluated in determining best value to the Government.

<DESC>This announcement is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services in accordance with the procedures of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested; a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The scope of this project is to collect roughness and Global Positioning System (GPS) data on paved roads in the Forest Highway (FH) Network.  Roads and approximate mileage shown in parenthesis are located in the states of Arizona (179), California, (total 2,302, with 1242 north, 702 east, and 358 south), Colorado (242), Nebraska (16), Nevada (63), New Mexico (11), North Dakota (29), South Dakota (83), Utah (116), and Wyoming (54).  Mileage on the network totals 3,100 miles.  

Beginning and ending termini and route lengths will be provided.

Technical Requirements:  Roughness data will be collected using a South Dakota Type inertial profile-measuring device, or other device as approved by the Contracting Officer, and built according to ASTM E950 standards. The profiler must collect the dynamic longitudinal profile of the pavement surface to calculate the pavement International Roughness Index (IRI) roughness index according to ASTM E1926-98.  Quarter car simulation will be used to provide IRI data for both the left and right wheel paths.  Calculated roughness indexes need be averaged and reported using the Central Federal Lands defined interval of a tenth of a mile.

GPS must be collected at intervals no more than 5 seconds and must provide less than 5 meter accuracy after post-processing.

Deliverables:  A data collection report will be prepared that documents all fieldwork and ride statistics (IRI).  All data, test results, and pertinent information will be provided in a separate report for each state.  This will include, but not limited to the following:

1. A general summary of the designated roadways and field notes about any anomalies that might have influenced the results of the collected data; results of all field investigations, including all profile test results.
2.  A detailed road log for each route that includes starting and ending coordinates and accounts of any interruption in data collection.
3. A Microsoft Access database of IRI for each road segment (in tenth mile increments). Fields in the database must include FH route number, milepost (by tenth mile), IRI right wheel path, IRI left wheel path, IRI average, and speed (miles per hour) of the vehicle. A compiled database of all the routes in each state should also be included. All routes should be included into one database for each state.
4.  ArcView shapefiles with processed GPS coordinates.

Schedule:  All work and any necessary corrections are to be completed not later than October 17, 2006. This will include receiving all deliverables as described above.

The order in which each state is completed is at the contractor’s discretion, however most of the roads in the forest highway system are in mountainous and high elevation areas. It is recommended that priority should be given to high latitude and altitude locations first.  A proposed schedule that includes all work elements must be submitted with the firm’s offer.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will review all deliverables and request corrections when necessary.  Corrections will be made at no additional cost to FHWA and within the performance period of the contract. Data collection progress reports will be submitted on a monthly basis from the start of the project until the deadline.  

Progress reports will include:

1.  A list of all routes in which data collection has been made in that particular timeframe.
2.  A copy of all field reports for the above routes.

Field checks will be made by FHWA personnel. 3 sites for each functional class of roadway will be randomly selected across the entire network.  Field reports will be made and corrections requested by FHWA before September 15, 2006.
	
Evaluation Factors for Award:  Offers will be evaluated using the tradeoff process described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation under Subpart 15.101.  The tradeoff process allows FHWA to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.   Proposals will be rated on project approach to complete the work, technical capabilities, past performance, and price.  Provide 3 references for past performance for work accomplished for Federal, State, or Commercial entities.  Past performance will be evaluated in the areas of technical competence, contract scope, contract schedule, and budget management.  Include the name of the agency/entity, the point of contact, phone or fax number, type of work accomplished, dollar value of the contract, location and time frame of the work, recognition given for good performance, or problems encountered.  References will be contacted.   Project approach, technical capabilities, and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price.  Submit a proposal that demonstrates a thorough understanding of the scope of work.    

Pricing:
The following pricing structure should be used.
Price Element:  Provide Price, Unit/Quantity, Rate, and Extension (of price) for each of the following:  (1) Personnel  (2) Equipment  (3) Vehicle  (4) Mileage (includes Gas)  (5) PerDiem  (6) Deliverables  (7) Other (List other pricing items that would be included in your offer.) and a Total price for all Extensions.

Provide the number of personnel you intend to utilize and their rate of pay; equipment type and quantity; number of vehicles; preparation and submission of deliverables; and other price factors.  Overhead and profit should be built-in to the price elements above.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
RFP HSCG84-06-R-AAT136
THIS IS PART A OF A TWO PART COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  PART B IS AVAILABLE UNDER RFP HSCG84-06-R-AAT136-B.  DOCUMENT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS DUE TO LENGTH.

HSCG848-06-R-AAT136-A

(1)  INTRODUCTION:  This is of a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request For Proposal (RFP) number HSCG84-06-R-AAT136 is assigned for tracking purposes only. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08. The U.S. Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract for the purchase of Portable Side Scan Sonar Systems. The U.S. Coast Guard anticipates purchasing multiple units over a 10 year period, the number of units will change to meet requirements at that time. The U.S. Coast Guard has an operational requirement to recover sunken or damaged Aids to Navigation, and utilizes WLM 175’ and WLB 225’ Buoy Tenders to recover sunken buoys. The most time effective search method for locating sunken buoys is to use a sonar system to scan large areas of terrain. The original hull mounted system installed when the Buoy Tenders were constructed has been discontinued, making servicing and parts increasingly difficult. A hull mounted system requires costly drydock periods to service the transducers, therefore the Coast Guard desires a portable, towable array side scan sonar system that will lower maintenance costs. Unlike the previous systems installed, the new system should be user friendly to operate and provide clear, high resolution, easily interpretable images of the areas scanned. It is therefore desired for the operation of the system to be done through a GUI (Graphical User Interface), such as through the Microsoft Windows Operating System. Since the sonar system may not be used on regular intervals, the system should require little or no regular maintenance when not in use. The system should be capable of easy and quick troubleshooting by minimally trained operators. In order to keep the capability of viewing and controlling sonar returns from the bridge, the system will have connection points on the bridge and buoy deck with interconnecting shipboard cable to connect the portable system together. Additionally, the Coast Guard desires a system that will be supported by the equipment manufacturer in it’s present configuration for a period of time not less than 10 years. Due to weight and space limitations, the system should be easily stored aboard the Coast Guard’s buoy tenders, and be easily lifted by one crewmember. All products offered including items in the Parts Kits or individual components must be new. Used or Refurbished Items/Parts are not acceptable.


(2)  SCHEDULE OF SERVICES:  The following is the estimated number of Systems, Spares and Training Support anticipated over the 10 year period of this Requirements Contract. Please note this is an estimated number that does not bind the Coast Guard to commitment for Delivery Orders and quantities placed against the awarded contract.

   c.  Period for acceptance of offers.  Fill-in:  90 calendar days.  

52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

(i)	Technical Approach;
(ii)	Past Performance;
(iii)	Price

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, if all other factors are equal, price may be the determining factor.

The offeror’s proposal shall contain a response to each of the areas identified below.  Only those proposals prepared in accordance with the solicitation will be evaluated.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on three factors:

Technical Proposal/Factor 1:  (Most Important)  
(i)	Salient Characteristics.  The written technical proposal must contain sufficient descriptive information such as the Manufacturer, Make and Model Number and include salient characteristics, schematics and/or other technical drawings so the Government can determine the system offered meets or exceeds the Government’s minimum requirements.  	
(ii)	Parts Kit.  The technical proposal shall address the contents of the Parts Kits required by Paragraph  v.  If the offeror cannot provide a Parts Kit to the system being offered, the proposal shall provide an alternative means of obtaining spare parts, including a list of component parts and their price and availability supported by a commercial price list.  
(iii)	Training.  The technical proposal shall include a detailed description of the training package being offered. 
(iv)	Technical Support.  The proposal shall address the contractor’s approach to providing on-call/on-site technical support.
(v)	The proposal shall address the ability to provide additional operator and maintenance manuals.  

Past Performance/Factor 2:  (As Important as Technical Proposal) The proposal must contain the names of government or private corporation clients to whom they have provided the same system, including training and technical support, within the last three years.  

Price/Factor 3:   (Least Important)  The cost proposal shall contain supporting documentation of the price proposed such as a commercial price list in order to determine price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.  Although price is not the controlling factor in award of a contract under this solicitation; it is an important factor and should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of the equality of the proposals in terms of the other evaluation factors on which selection is based.  If competing proposals are substantially equal in technical and past performance, price may be the determining factor in award.

Exclusion of any of this information may cause the proposal to be excluded from consideration.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items (March 2005)
An offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NFFK0-6-195 is issued as a request for quotation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541618.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requires a contractor to accomplish important tasks in the support of the Office of Habitat Conservation.  NOAA is aware that college and university undergraduate and graduate students now enrolled in natural resources programs are insufficient to meet the expected demand for employment in the future or in making the natural resource profession more representative of the nation’s multi-ethnic population.  NOAA seeks to introduce to, and stimulate interest in natural resource related sciences in, students rarely exposed to the applied aspects of science.  NOAA further seeks to funnel these high school students into an academic “pipeline” at the end of which are a large variety of careers in fisheries science and management.
NOAA wants to enhance educational opportunities for minority and women high school students in natural resource related sciences. Its goal is to introduce students to, stimulate interest in, and develop an appreciation of science disciplines associated with natural resource and environmental management.  To do this, NOAA seeks to augment an existing program that is currently providing high school students with experiences similar to that which NOAA seeks.  The program, open to students in grades 10, 11, and 12, where they would work during the summer with mentors from natural resource related sciences, in laboratories, and in the field, by collecting samples and assisting in analyzing NOAA data.  NOAA seeks to provide students with opportunities to participate in projects that involve habitat protection and restoration.   NOAA is building a body of knowledge to accomplish its objectives and is seeking unique reports that will help it do so as part of the proposed contract.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Plastic Blasting Media
Malmstrom AFB, MT


The contractor must provide a supply of Plastic Blasting Media (PBM), brand name “Quick Strip or Equal” and glass beads for abrasive blasting operations in the 341 MMXS Corrosion Shop.  Operations will be conducted in a new facility.  A new blasting booth will be installed and initial system operation is scheduled for 15 May 2006.  Once removal operations begin, used media will contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromates.  It will be considered a hazardous waste unless properly recycled.  Used blasting media must be reclaimed and recycled to prevent the creation of a hazardous waste stream.  The contractor must ensure spent media is recycled in manner that complies with all state and federal laws and requirements.
	a.  Product specifications require media of Medium 20/40 mesh in 300# drums or equivalent.  Also, glass beads will be pruchased under the terms of this agreement.  An initial purchase of 2,000 pounds of Plastic Media will be required to charge the PBM system with an open purchase agreement to purchase additional supplies as required.
	b.  An initial purchase of 200 pounds of glass beads will be required to charge the sand blasting cabinet with an open purchase agreement to purchase additional supplies as required.

SCOPE:  The Statement of Work (SOW) covers the requirements for a contract to purchase blasting media to Malmstrom AFB for use in de-painting and removing corrosion.  The Contractors shall remove the spent blast media (SBM) from Malmstrom AFB and recycle it in a manner that will prevent it from being considered a solid waste or hazardous waste.  This contract shall provide for media delivery, SBM pick up, transportation and recycling by the contractor as specified herein. 
 
The Contractors shall provide the labor, required equipment, transportation, necessary plant facilities for recycling, ensure regulatory permitting, and obtain all regulatory agency approvals as necessary to legally fulfill the requirements of this SOW.  


SPENT BLAST MEDIA HANDLING REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor shall provide containers for the collection of the SBM at the generation points on Malmstrom AFB.  

The SBM shall be collected in the containers provided by the contractor, labeled by the government, and held by the government for pick up by the contractor.  The government will ensure that the SBM is acceptable for pick up.  All inspection data by government or contractor will remain on file with the government for a minimum of two years.

When the contractor is notified that a load of SBM is ready for pickup it must be removed within 30 calendar days.  The Contractors shall notify the government at least 48 hours ahead of the truck arrival date.

The Contractors shall arrange and pay for transportation from Malmstrom AFB to the contractor facility where recycling occurs.  The contractor is solely responsible for the SBM while in transit.  If an accident or spill of the SBM occurs while in transit, the contractor is solely responsible for cleanup and for any notifications required by federal, state or local regulations.

All transporting, storing, handling, manufacturing processes, and recycling of the SBM shall be performed within the continental United States.

Contractor shall use the SBM in a recycling process that satisfies the USEPA regulations such that the SBM is not a solid waste and therefore is not a hazardous waste.  The federal regulatory requirements, which must be satisfied by the Contractor, follows:

The Contractor shall accept the premise that the SBM is a “spent material” in accordance with 40CFR 261.1(c)(1).  “A spent material is any material that has been used and as a result of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced, without processing.”

A “spent material” is not a solid waste when it can be shown to be recycled by one of the following three methods.  (40CFR 261.2(e)(1))

(i)  “Used or reused as ingredients in an industrial process to make a product, provided the materials are not being reclaimed; or

 (ii) Used or reused as effective substitutes for commercial products; or

(iii) Returned to the original process from which they are generated, without first being reclaimed or land disposed...”

The Contractor shall specify which of these three methods is used to recycle the SBM and explain in writing how the process satisfies the method.

The Contractor shall provide detailed documentation for the recycling process including facility location and layout, product formulation, process flow chart with all equipment shown, production rates, and other pertinent details.

If method (ii) is used, the contractor shall provide documentation showing how much SBM is used in the formulation and what ingredients it is a substitute for shall be provided.   Proof that it is an “effective substitute” shall be provided, such that the “toxics along for the ride (TAR)” concern, as addressed by EPA, is satisfied. This documentation must be provided to the government.

The products of the recycling process shall be completely described and documented.  They shall meet the criteria at 40CFR 261.2(e)(2) as follows.

(i) Recycled products shall not be “Applied to the Land”.  Specifically, “applied to the land” to mean without limitation such items as fence posts, blocks or concrete block like products or other items that are used underground and/or that are used in contact with the earth.  The contractor shall accept this interpretation and shall not propose or use recycling processes that produce such items.

(ii) The recycling process shall not involve “Materials burned for energy recovery, used to produce a fuel, or contained in fuels; or

(iii) “Materials accumulated speculatively”, the definition of which is given at 40CFR 261.1(c)(7)).  The SBM, prior to recycle, shall not be accumulated speculatively.  The Contractor shall provide documentation and data that demonstrates compliance with this requirement for each month that the recycle process has been used. 


The Contractor shall provide the documentation described in 40CFR 261.2(f) demonstrating that there is a known market for the recyclable material and demonstrating that the recycling of the material meets the requirements for exclusion or exemption contained in 40CFR 261.  

The Contractor shall recognize and understand that in addition to the USEPA regulations cited herein, the states involved may have regulations that are more stringent or broader in scope.  In that case the contractor shall identify those requirements and comply with the state regulations.  This applies as a minimum for the state of Montana and for the state or states where the recycling is done.

The Contractors shall ensure all containers are properly labeled, sealed, and in good condition for shipping prior to shipping of SBM containers.  The Contractors shall be responsible for the completion of appropriate information on all labels.  The Contractors shall replace any damaged containers before transport.  The contractor shall provide the government with net weights of each container of SBM transported off Malmstrom AFB.

The Contractor shall provide the Government with complete tracking and handling records of each container of SBM. This will include data from the point of pick up through proper recycling of the SBM.    This record shall be submitted in updated form each calendar month to the contract administrator and to the Hazardous Waste Program Manager at Malmstrom AFB.

If SBM that is initially designated as recyclable by the government and is later designated and properly disposed of by the Contractor as hazardous waste, the contractor shall provide copies of manifests to the contract administrator and the Hazardous Waste Program Manager.   The Contractor shall ensure and certify that all actions taken in this regard adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and permits.

<DESC>The following is provided for clarification purposes regarding the Battery Operated Order Picker:
Question:
1. Can you provide more detail for this phrase  "will require gull wings 24 inches (12 inches on either side), capable of being operated by one person," that appears in the solicitation for the Battery operated order picker. Are the gull wings merely an extension of the operator platform so it is safer to operate in a 72" aisle or are they something totally different? Does the capable of operation by one person refer to operating the overall truck or to operating the gull wings?  
Answer:
1. "gull wings" are referred to the extensions on the 2 sides of the unit.  They shaped like wings, and is for the purpose of personnel safety, & it provides a sense of security while standing when the unit is moving or moved up in the air.  The gull wings do not move.  Operation refers to the unit going up and down or moving around.

1.  Assuming the shelving configuration is a single row of shelving, then a pick aisle, then two rows of shelving back to back, then a pick aisle, and finally a single row of shelving does your system, indeed, have only TWO PICK AISLES??
Answer:
1.  Our facility is being built.  The plan is to have four (4) rows of shelvings in parallel. There will be three (3) aisles in between the four (4) shelvings plus the two (2) outside access rows.      
Question:
2. How many linear feet is each pick aisle?
Answer:
2. The shelvings are all different in length.  The longest is about 81 ft, the shortest is about 63 ft, and the width of each is about 8 ft.  The shortest distance between the end of 1 shelving and the wall where the hook up shall be is about 9 ft.  We estimated the total length of wire needed is within 450 ft.
Question:
3.  Is the shelving system open on each end where the truck can exit to a perpendicular main aisle?
Answer:
3. Shelvings are open at both ends for order picker access.  
Question: 
4.  Is there a source of 120VAC in the vicinity of the shelving system or is it the contractor's responsibility to run the AC power source from an existing service panel?
Answer:
4.  120vac power outlets will be available at the site.  If the wire guidance system requires to be hard wired with a cut off switch, for example, it shall be reflected in the proposal.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Plastic Blasting Media
Malmstrom AFB, MT


The contractor must provide a supply of Plastic Blasting Media (PBM), brand name “Quick Strip or Equal” and glass beads for abrasive blasting operations in the 341 MMXS Corrosion Shop.  Operations will be conducted in a new facility.  A new blasting booth will be installed and initial system operation is scheduled for 15 May 2006.  Once removal operations begin, used media will contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromates.  It will be considered a hazardous waste unless properly recycled.  Used blasting media must be reclaimed and recycled to prevent the creation of a hazardous waste stream.  The contractor must ensure spent media is recycled in manner that complies with all state and federal laws and requirements.
	a.  Product specifications require media of Medium 20/40 mesh in 300# drums or equivalent.  Also, glass beads will be pruchased under the terms of this agreement.  An initial purchase of 2,000 pounds of Plastic Media will be required to charge the PBM system with an open purchase agreement to purchase additional supplies as required.
	b.  An initial purchase of 200 pounds of glass beads will be required to charge the sand blasting cabinet with an open purchase agreement to purchase additional supplies as required.

SCOPE:  The Statement of Work (SOW) covers the requirements for a contract to purchase blasting media to Malmstrom AFB for use in de-painting and removing corrosion.  The Contractors shall remove the spent blast media (SBM) from Malmstrom AFB and recycle it in a manner that will prevent it from being considered a solid waste or hazardous waste.  This contract shall provide for media delivery, SBM pick up, transportation and recycling by the contractor as specified herein. 
 
The Contractors shall provide the labor, required equipment, transportation, necessary plant facilities for recycling, ensure regulatory permitting, and obtain all regulatory agency approvals as necessary to legally fulfill the requirements of this SOW.  


SPENT BLAST MEDIA HANDLING REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor shall provide containers for the collection of the SBM at the generation points on Malmstrom AFB.  

The SBM shall be collected in the containers provided by the contractor, labeled by the government, and held by the government for pick up by the contractor.  The government will ensure that the SBM is acceptable for pick up.  All inspection data by government or contractor will remain on file with the government for a minimum of two years.

When the contractor is notified that a load of SBM is ready for pickup it must be removed within 30 calendar days.  The Contractors shall notify the government at least 48 hours ahead of the truck arrival date.

The Contractors shall arrange and pay for transportation from Malmstrom AFB to the contractor facility where recycling occurs.  The contractor is solely responsible for the SBM while in transit.  If an accident or spill of the SBM occurs while in transit, the contractor is solely responsible for cleanup and for any notifications required by federal, state or local regulations.

All transporting, storing, handling, manufacturing processes, and recycling of the SBM shall be performed within the continental United States.

Contractor shall use the SBM in a recycling process that satisfies the USEPA regulations such that the SBM is not a solid waste and therefore is not a hazardous waste.  The federal regulatory requirements, which must be satisfied by the Contractor, follows:

The Contractor shall accept the premise that the SBM is a “spent material” in accordance with 40CFR 261.1(c)(1).  “A spent material is any material that has been used and as a result of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced, without processing.”

A “spent material” is not a solid waste when it can be shown to be recycled by one of the following three methods.  (40CFR 261.2(e)(1))

(i)  “Used or reused as ingredients in an industrial process to make a product, provided the materials are not being reclaimed; or

 (ii) Used or reused as effective substitutes for commercial products; or

(iii) Returned to the original process from which they are generated, without first being reclaimed or land disposed...”

The Contractor shall specify which of these three methods is used to recycle the SBM and explain in writing how the process satisfies the method.

The Contractor shall provide detailed documentation for the recycling process including facility location and layout, product formulation, process flow chart with all equipment shown, production rates, and other pertinent details.

If method (ii) is used, the contractor shall provide documentation showing how much SBM is used in the formulation and what ingredients it is a substitute for shall be provided.   Proof that it is an “effective substitute” shall be provided, such that the “toxics along for the ride (TAR)” concern, as addressed by EPA, is satisfied. This documentation must be provided to the government.

The products of the recycling process shall be completely described and documented.  They shall meet the criteria at 40CFR 261.2(e)(2) as follows.

(i) Recycled products shall not be “Applied to the Land”.  Specifically, “applied to the land” to mean without limitation such items as fence posts, blocks or concrete block like products or other items that are used underground and/or that are used in contact with the earth.  The contractor shall accept this interpretation and shall not propose or use recycling processes that produce such items.

(ii) The recycling process shall not involve “Materials burned for energy recovery, used to produce a fuel, or contained in fuels; or

(iii) “Materials accumulated speculatively”, the definition of which is given at 40CFR 261.1(c)(7)).  The SBM, prior to recycle, shall not be accumulated speculatively.  The Contractor shall provide documentation and data that demonstrates compliance with this requirement for each month that the recycle process has been used. 


The Contractor shall provide the documentation described in 40CFR 261.2(f) demonstrating that there is a known market for the recyclable material and demonstrating that the recycling of the material meets the requirements for exclusion or exemption contained in 40CFR 261.  

The Contractor shall recognize and understand that in addition to the USEPA regulations cited herein, the states involved may have regulations that are more stringent or broader in scope.  In that case the contractor shall identify those requirements and comply with the state regulations.  This applies as a minimum for the state of Montana and for the state or states where the recycling is done.

The Contractors shall ensure all containers are properly labeled, sealed, and in good condition for shipping prior to shipping of SBM containers.  The Contractors shall be responsible for the completion of appropriate information on all labels.  The Contractors shall replace any damaged containers before transport.  The contractor shall provide the government with net weights of each container of SBM transported off Malmstrom AFB.

The Contractor shall provide the Government with complete tracking and handling records of each container of SBM. This will include data from the point of pick up through proper recycling of the SBM.    This record shall be submitted in updated form each calendar month to the contract administrator and to the Hazardous Waste Program Manager at Malmstrom AFB.

If SBM that is initially designated as recyclable by the government and is later designated and properly disposed of by the Contractor as hazardous waste, the contractor shall provide copies of manifests to the contract administrator and the Hazardous Waste Program Manager.   The Contractor shall ensure and certify that all actions taken in this regard adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and permits.

REVISED Statement of Work/Specifications
A.1 Introduction:
The U.S.DOC/NOAA,Aircraft Operations Center (AOC),MacDill AFB,Florida, intends to exchange four T56-A-14 engines in as is condition with complete logbooks for one T56-A-14 engine mounted in a Quick Engine Chnage(QEC)in Ready for Installation (RFI)condition with logbooks and two,overhauled to zero time PT6A-27 engines with logbooks.
A.2 Background:	
NOAA operates two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. Four Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines power each WP-3D. NOAA also operates a fleet of four DeHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine. Currently, NOAA has two spare, RFI T56-A-14 engines. With the projected acquisition of a third P-3C, NOAA anticipates the requirement for one additional spare RFI T56-A-14 engine. Additionally, NOAA does not have any spare zero time engines for the fleet of Twin Otters. With the ever increasing amount of annual flight hours flown by these aircraft,it would be in NOAA’s best interest to have two spare,0.0 hour TSO PT6A-27 engines. NOAA AOC in Tampa, Florida, manages these aircraft.
A.3 Scope:
Engines to be exchanged are as follows:
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH9044 with 14,804.5 hrs Time Since New (TSN)
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH8010 with 15,209.3 hrs TSN.
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH8000 with 16,429.0 hrs TSN.
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH4515 with 20,295.3 hrs TSN.
a.Engines are in as removed condition, but were in operable condition when removed from the aircraft.
