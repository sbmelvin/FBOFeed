<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for:  Sony Digital Betacam Editing Recorder.  The DVW-A500 features Betacam and Betacam SP Playback capability, pre-read capability for video and audio, serial digiital V/A interface (SMPTE 259M) along with built-in Component analog video and audio interfaces, and an optional Composite analog input (BKDW-505).

<DESC>National Nuclear Security Administration Service Center Request for Information (RFI)  Regarding the Purchase of Renewable Electrical Energy For Pantex Plant - Amarillo, Texas and Kansas City Plant - Kansas City, Missouri 1 Background National Nuclear Security Administration Service Center - The U. S. Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration Security Administration Service Center (NNSA) has management and administrative responsibility for various national laboratories and weapons production plants that were formerly administered by the U.S. Department of Energy.  Through this RFI, NNSA is seeking sources of non-hydroelectric renewable energy generated from solar, geothermal, biomass, or wind technologies to supply up to 7 ½% of electric energy requirements of the NNSA Pantex Plant, located approximately 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas and the NNSA Kansas City Plant, located at 1200 East Banister Road, Kansas City, Missouri. NNSA owns and operates substation facilities and distribution facilities that connect to the transmission system of Southwestern Public Service (SPS) and Kansas City Power and Light (KCPL).  SPS currently supplies the full requirements of the Pantex Plant and KCPL currently supplies the full requirements of the Kansas City Plant.  Both locations are supplied under retail service tariffs. The NNSA is requesting information regarding options to supply non-hydroelectric renewable energy to be delivered to SPS for redelivery to the Pantex Plant and to KCPL for redelivery to the Kansas City Plant.  Owners and/or marketers of renewable resources located in Texas, Missouri and/or neighboring states are encouraged to respond.  Alternatively, renewable sources located adjacent to either the Pantex Plant or the Kansas City Plant may consider direct connection to the NNSA owned distribution switchgear. 2 Desired Resource Characteristics 2.1 Amount and Type of Power -Approximately 17 gegawatt hours (GWh) is required annually.  Of this amount approximately 5.5 GWh annually is required for the Pantex Plant facilities and approximately 11.5 GWh annually is required for the Kansas City Plant facilities.   The NNSA will consider only sources of non-hydroelectric renewable energy supplies for this RFI that include the green attributes. 2.2 Types of Resources Considered - Energy will be considered from existing resources as well as from future resources that are committed to become operational during the period of consideration.  The NNSA will consider only sources of non-hydroelectric renewable energy resources for this RFI. 2.3 Full/Partial/ Renewable Energy Requirements - The NNSA is interested in receiving responses from non-hydroelectric renewable energy providers that could supply in part or in total the approximate 17 GWh requirement. Respondents may respond for either the Pantex Plant or the Kansas City Plant or both, but are not required to address the combined requirements of both sites. 3 Evaluation Criteria - The following criteria are used by NNSA to evaluate the suitability of resources.  Respondents may wish to address these criteria in their responses. 3.1.1 Cost - The total delivered cost per megawatt hour (MWh) for delivery to the SPS or KCPL transmission system, taking into account capacity charges, energy charges, on-peak and off-peak pricing, escalation factors, ancillary service charges, transmission costs, administrative costs, and any other charges included in the response to get the energy to the two transmission systems.   NNSA has initiated discussions with SPS and KCPL for network transmission service arrangements to redeliver power to the Pantex Plant and the Kansas City Plant.  NNSA will work with the respondents and the associated utilities to develop appropriate delivery arrangements, and NNSA will be responsible for the transmission service and ancillary service costs on the SPS and KCPL transmission systems. Respondents should include a description of the proposed resource, scheduling restrictions and requirements, term, conditions on term extension or cancellation, and pricing terms (basic rates and charges, escalation factors, adjustment factors, penalties for failure to deliver, rates/escalation for term extension). Respondents proposing non-dispatchable resources should provide the NNSA with an estimated generation profile on a daily/weekly/seasonal/annual basis, as appropriate to the particular generating resource(s) described. 3.1.2 Environmental Impact - The environmental impact of the generating resource(s), based on technology used to generate the power, and compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Respondents should consider supplying information about the technology, type renewable energy source, generating efficiency, and compliance with applicable environmental regulations for the generating resource(s) proposed. Respondents proposing a variety of resources and technologies should consider including the requested information about each resource and technology type where possible, and the approximate percent contribution of each to the total resource proposed. 3.1.3 Dependability - Generating resource(s) dependability, based on forced outage rates, scheduled maintenance outages, and the dependability of the transmission system involved in delivering the power. Respondents should consider specifying the generating unit(s) or system(s) supplying the power and consider providing information about the historical dependability of the generating resource(s) using industry standard measures such as capacity factor and forced outage rates, or to provide typical outage rates for similar generating facilities of the same manufacturer, owner, technology, age, and type. 3.2 Transmission Availability and Transmission System Loading 3.2.1 Transmission Availability - The availability and adequacy of transmission capacity between the resource offered and the SPS or KCPL system to deliver the resource and reliance on transmission system additions and upgrades and other transmission costs to provide the transmission capacity needed for delivery. Respondents should consider providing information about the transmission path(s), terms of third party transmission agreements, and procedures for curtailing deliveries. 3.2.2 Transmission Service to Delivery Points- Respondents will be responsible for arranging all the transmission service and ancillary services needed to deliver energy to the SPS and KCPL transmission systems. NNSA is working on transmission service arrangements with SPS and KCPL for delivery of renewable energy to the Pantex Plant and the Kansas City Plant facilities. 3.3 Dispatchability - The ability of the proposed generating resource(s) to respond to changes in customer load or to schedules by the NNSA.  The flexibility of the resource to deliver less energy than the maximum amounts in Section 2.1, due to power system conditions. 3.4 Risk and Supplier Responsibility - The risk that the supplier will be unable to deliver the required amounts of capacity and energy, or lacks the financial resources to be able to continue operating for the entire time period proposed. Respondents may wish to address both their financial stability and their operating capability by providing information such as: annual reports, Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K and FERC Form 1 reports (where applicable), audited financial statements including income statements and balance sheets, bond ratings, evidence of required licenses, FERC approval to sell power at market-based rates (where applicable), accreditations and certifications, and information on relevant regulatory oversight. 3.5 Diversity ? Respondents should discuss the possibility that the failure of a single generating unit or transmission facility will interrupt power delivery.  Also, the respondents should address the possibility that future environmental or other regulations will increase the cost of generation and make it uneconomic. Respondents should consider including information about resource diversity, such as whether the resources are system resources or unit resources. 3.6 Delivery Points - The Federal loads are located in the Amarillo, Texas and Kansas City, Missouri area. Preferred delivery points for power are either direct ties to the Pantex Plant or Kansas City Plant distribution switchgear, or at any point on the SPS or KCPL transmission systems.  The NNSA may consider other delivery points if transmission availability and cost are such that the resulting resource is cost competitive. 4 Legal and Regulatory Issues Department of Energy National Environmental Policy Act Compliance - If the NNSA were to contract for resources that have yet to be constructed, it would first be required to consider the potential environmental impacts of constructing and operating the resource as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and the Department of Energy NEPA Implementing Procedures (40 CFR 1021). 5 Timeframe - The NNSA is interested in committed resources that would be available for a five to 10 year period, with initial deliveries beginning on or before October 1, 2005. 6 Process and Timing 6.1 Process - The NNSA will evaluate all responses received and inform its customer of pertinent characteristic of the resources. 6.2 Timing - Responses should be received in the NNSA by 5:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time (MST) on the due date set forth in 6.3 to be considered in our evaluation. 6.2.1 Notification - The NNSA will provide an acknowledgment to all responses received.  We may seek additional information or clarification to individual responses as needed. 6.3 Submission of Responses - The NNSA will accept responses that are e-mailed, mailed or faxed. The address of the NNSA Service Center is: Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration Service Center ? Albuquerque Office P.O. Box 5400 Albuquerque, NM 87185-5400 Responses can be faxed to the NNSA at (505) 845-4210, attention Milton West. Offers should be received in the NNSA by 5:00 p.m. MST, November 10, 2003. Questions about this RFI can be submitted to the same address, e-mailed to the NNSA at the address mwest@doeal.gov, or by telephone to Milton West at (505) 845-4452. 6.1 Use of Information in Offers - The NNSA will provide information to the customer about the supplier, cost, terms, and conditions of the resources. The NNSA will not divulge identifying information in responses to others not involved in this RFI process, but may supply general information about the responses received to other federal customers or NNSA employees if requested. The NNSA may choose to pursue other resource needs unrelated to the requirements described in this RFI based on the responses received. 6.2 Confidentiality - If respondents do not wish to have part or all of the information in their offer available to the public, indicate that by marking the sensitive sections of the response ?Confidential.? 7 Documentation submitted by Respondent - Responses should include information about the respondent submitting the proposal.  Respondents should consider providing the information requested in Sections 2 and 3 in their responses. Including extraneous information in responses that is not requested in the RFI is discouraged.

<DESC>The objectives are to 1.Implement the surrogate safety assessment methodology in a stand-alone prototype software.2.Evaluate its sensitivity and validate it with field data.Scope:The initial efforts of this project will define and display surrogate measures of safety for intersections, identify data requirements from existing traffic simulation models, and coordinate accessibility and interfaces with software vendors.  Based on a set of  “mandatory” software design requirements in FHWA-RD-03-050, a code will be developed to extract required data from traffic simulation software and compute surrogate safety measures.  Sensitivity analysis and theoretical validation will be conducted to validate the model using existing crash models and crash modification factors.  Then a field calibration and validation study will be conducted to further evaluate the model using primarily crash and possibly conflict data.  If the validation is promising, a prototype model should be improved to include all specifications defined as “important” software requirements in FHWA-RD-03-050. The model shall be tested again and a final report written to describe the full effort, including software design and coding documentation, validation efforts, and user manual.

<CONTACT>Cindy M. Tafoya 562-626-7378
<DESC>One Each 336 square feet, class 10,000 CLEAN ROOM, in accordance with the following specifications: The Naval Postgraduate School has started an initiative to study and develop Nanotechnologies and MicroElectroMechanical Systems that can be incorporated into DoD systems.  A lot of the processes for developing and characterization of these nano- and micro-devices requires a very clean environment; therefore we are required to build a cleanroom that can support most of the research and instructional objectives of NPS’ new initiative but at the same time remains economically feasible.  Therefore we have decided to build the cleanroom in two stages.  This document lists the requirements for the first stage, but since there is a plan for future upgrades, these must be taken into consideration during the design of the first stage.  Thus we have also included a general scope of the inte nded upgrades. An existing room has already been selected for the location of both cleanroom projects.  The size of the existing room is 25’ x 40’ with a ceiling height of approximately 14’.  This existing room is located on the top floor of a 2 story building.  The roof is structurally sound and was specifically designed to support heavy machinery.  One of the 25’ long walls of the room is adjacent to the exterior of the building and currently has windows for about 16 linear feet.  On this wall there are sheet-metal removable panels located at 9ft and higher heights.  These can be used as an easy path to access roof mounted HVAC, air handlers, and exhaust systems. Installation must be coordinated with NPS’ end-users and NPS’ department of Public Works. The detail specifications for the first cleanroom are as follows: ·	Build a 350 sq ft x 8 ft tall ISO Class 7 clean room w ith temperature control set at 68 deg F +/- 3 deg F or better with 40% RH +/- 10% or better taking into account Monterey Bay’s unique climate.  Must be able to maintain temp and humidity specifications for at least 300 days of the year.  ·	a maximum of 2000 cfm chemical vapor exhaust system – 1000 cfm of solvent fumes and 1000 cfm of HF acid fumes.  Both need to be scrubbed before discharging to the atmosphere. ·	HVAC and air handling systems must be located on the roof of the 2 story building.  Cleanroom location is on the top level (second level of a 2 story building.) ·	DI water system with a capacity of up-to 5 gpm for up to 1 minute intervals.  If a lower capacity system is used, it will require a small (around 10 gallons) DI water storage tank.  ·	Water drain connected to building's drain pipe  ·	Acid Drain connected to an external 55 gallon drum tank located 1 level  down w/ minimum 1” ID – gravity feed OK. Drum tank must provide fill-status alarm system.  ·	Solvent Drain connected to an external 55 gallon drum tank located in a solvent storage room adjacent to the cleanroom facility – 1” ID with explosion proof solvent pump system required because drum tank at same level of solvent discharge. Drum tank must include fill-status alarm system.  ·	One 2’ x 2’ pass thru with door access interlocks. ·	3 Connections for high pressure (3000 psi) Air, N2, and CO2 gases. (Gas bottles will be stored in a room adjacent to the cleanroom.)  ·	3 Connections for low pressure (300 psi) Air, N2 gases. (1 extra for expansion)  ·	4 -220 VAC (30 amps) and 8 -110 VAC (20 amps) outlets  ·	Acid/solvent resistant floor (seamless). ·	Cleanroom’s layout, HVAC, and air handling facility must accommodate for upgrade to a 900 sqft size in one to two year timefr ame. ·	Gowning area must be also taken into the layout considerations and can be reduced to 100,000 class area. Typical operation will require up-to 4 people gowning at any one time.  Cleanroom access will be limited to up-to 6 people at any one time. The planned upgrades to take into consideration are as follows:  ·	Expand the initial 350 sq ft clean room with additional 550 sq ft x 8 ft tall at ISO 7 specifications (for a total of 900 sq ft), but leave the 350 sqft isolated  ·	Upgrade the 350 sq ft area to ISO 6 (class 1,000). ·	Upgrade the gowning area to accept up to 8 people at any one time. ·	No further exhaust systems or DI systems are anticipated. Oral Solicitation N00244-03-T-1032 will be utilized in accordance with SAP procedures for this procurement.  IMPORTANT NOTICE: DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contract Registration applies to all solicitation iss ued on or after 6-1-98.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract to eTouch Systems, Inc., pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. This procurement is a continuation of work currently being performed, in support of NASA Headquarters, Office of Public Affairs, Media Services Division.   The current contractor provides ongoing support and continued development for the NASA web portal.  NASA intends to award a contract for a period of 1-year from December 1, 2003, to November 30, 2004, with a 1-year option potentially extending the contract through November 30, 2005. The contractor will continue to work within the framework of the existing design and information technology infrastructure created under the predecessor contract.  The contractor provides NASA with hosting, caching and Web streaming services; a comprehensive content management system; statistical data and analysis; professional training & documentation; conversion of NASA Web content in a variety of different formats into the portal content management system and infrastructure; support, including help-desk support and escalation procedures, for NASA's use of all these services and tools.  The contractor will support the continued development and improvements for the graphic design of the portal, the underlying information architecture, the browsable directory structure, the search capability, the customizable "myNASA" feature, the portal's existing taxonomy and related metadata. eTouch Systems is currently the only vendor, that has the infrastructure in place to provide these services without risking major disruption to NASA's public presence shortly before a critical Agency mission event. On Jan. 3, 2004, the rover Spirit will land on the surface of Mars, beginning 5 months of mission operations. NASA expects the event to generate levels of interest at the Web site equivalent to the interest generated by the Olympics. NASA expects to distribute hundreds of high-resolution photographs in real-time to hundreds of thousands of users simultaneously, requiring Web traffic throughput capacity as high as 12 gigabits per second.To be properly prepared for this major event, a new vendor would have to have its infrastructure -- including a newly created content management system, search capability, customizable portal components, Web hosting and caching systems, and security and support services -- in place and ready for mission simulations and load testing at least 30 days in advance of the landing. This 30-day lead time would include transitioning NASA's Web content (more than 150,000 pieces of content so far) from the existing content management system into a system provided by the new vendor, who would also have train several dozen NASA employees and contractors in use of the system. In addition, eTouch has established a complex assistance network with other companies and a new vendor would be required to show access to the same kinds of resources.   With high visibility events quickly approaching, NASA does not believe that any alternative sources can, within the limited timeframe, take on full contract responsibility without risk of interrupting NASA's ability to communicate with the public through its Web portal during periods of high visibility for the Agency.  Because of the time involved in procuring and phasing-in services from another contractor in such a short time, eTouch is considered to be the only source capable of meeting NASA's needs.	 Any other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the NASA's GSFC office and contact listed below.	See Note(s) 22. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA specific note "B".

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on a sole source basis with Quality Resources Systems, Inc., 11350 Random Hills Road, Suite 100, Fairfax, VA  22030.  The NAICS Code is 541690.  This acquisition is for services to measure the relationship between Title VII - supported medical schools and residencies in graduate medical education, in the production of primary care physicians, both overall and for those choosing to practice in rural and medically underserved communities.  The project is designed to measure the effectiveness of these programs over time and will be national in scope.  The project will use physician data on undergrads and graduate training locations and years of training together with information on practice location to test the relationship between Title VII - funded undergraduate and residency medically underserved communities.  The Quality Resources Systems (QSR) owns the necessary 1999 American Medical Associates (AMA) master file needed to conduct the project.  The master file needed for this project has been augmented by data on physicians training histories and other important data pertinent to this project, which no other vendor has the rights to produce. QRS  s the only vendor with extensive experience with the key data elements and the Geographic Information System (GIS) software required to conduct the Title VII evaluation and maintains the official master file     Any other organization that attempts to develop this type of database  would have to replicate their previous accomplishments and develop the software before beginning the initial study on how to  demonstrate the importance of Title VII supported departments and residencies in graduate medical education, in  the production of primary care physicians, both overall and for those choosing to practice in rural and medically underserved communities.    This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would be recovered through competition, therefore, Quality Resources, Inc.,  is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Ion Ivanescu, Programs Development Director, Crude Oil and Gas Processing Department, Petrom S.A., 109 Calea Victoriei, 70176 Bucharest, Romania, Phone: (40) 21 212 98 74, Fax: (40) 21 315 98 49.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on an in-line blending system for Petrom’s Arpechim and Petrobrazi oil refineries in Romania.

SNP Petrom, the National Oil Company owns both the Arpechim and Petrobrazi refineries.  Petrom operates 34.5% of the total national oil and gas production- approximately 8 million metric tons per year.  In 2002, the two refineries processed 6.4 million tons of crude oil, representing 55% of the total crude processed in Romania.  Arpechim and Petrobrazi are sophisticated and complex refineries.  They produce liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, light and heavy fuel oil, coke, bitumen, lubricating oils, and sulfur.  

Both refineries are located near domestic crude oil fields, as well as connected via pipeline to import crude at the Port of Constanta on the Black Sea.  In terms of distribution, the two refineries are connected to pipelines that serve the domestic market as well as export terminals at the Black Sea Port of Constanta and the Danube terminal at Giurgu.

In oil refineries, a special process known as in-line blending assists in the final composition of a crude oil product.  The end product is obtained by mixing various oil qualities and additives continuously and in precisely defined quantities.  Due to certain variables during this process, such as reaction times in the control loop, changed mechanism settings, contamination of control valves, or similar disturbances, deviations from the intended result can occur.  These deviations can be detected by integrating the actual flow valves, thus enabling the set-valves to be corrected by a corresponding factor during the blending process.  As a result, the final oil product that reaches the storage tank will have the exact required composition necessary for selling on an open market.  

The current technology used to blend gasoline at the Arpechim and Petrobrazi refineries is a manually operated batch system.  The process by which blending agents are piped from holding tanks ultimately to a batch tank occurs entirely with valves that are hand controlled.  In order to comply with the new EURO 3 standards, this system must be upgraded to an automated in-line blending operation.

Petrom wants to convert its blending operations at the Arpechim and Petrobrazi facilities from a gasoline blending system to an in-line blending system in order to more efficiently utilize blending components, improve quality, reduce storage tank requirements and achieve cost-saving.  To achieve these goals, a comprehensive feasibility study is needed to consider all options for conversion to an in-line blending operation.  The feasibility study would review and analyze blending operations in detail and make recommendations for equipment and technological upgrades, changes in operational practice, and other important items to enhance the profitability of the refinery.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $216,240 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, OCTOBER 17, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Razvan Purdila, Director, Investment Projects Management Division, Transelectrica S.A., Blvd. Gen. Gh. Maheru 33, Bucharest-1, Romania 010325, Phone: (40) 21 303 5616, Fax: (40) 21 303 5660.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would examine the potential commercialization of existing telecommunications assets for the Romanian National Power Grid Company, Transelectrica S.A., and its affiliate Teletrans.

The Romanian National Power Grid Company, Transelectrica S.A., is in the process of implementing an ambitious and comprehensive series of projects aimed at the modernization of its transmission and dispatching systems that monitor the ebb and flow of the country’s electricity.  The main project of this package, initiated in 2000, is the implementation of a robust multi-ring optical fiber backbone with national coverage.  This is important because it will ensure proper communication for the on-line management of the power system and  reliability of electrical service to consumers throughout Romania.

As part of this modernization process, Transelectrica has formed Teletrans to focus on the operations and management of the IT and telecommunications facilities.  Teletrans will develop IT and telecom services for the efficient management, control, and security of the electric power transmission and distribution systems of Transelectrica.

Significant improvements in Transelectrica’s network, operated by its subsidiary Teletrans, are currently being made with the help of an EBRD and EIB loan.  Because Transelectrica has an excess of optical fiber with which to operate its telecommunications operations, the company has decided to allow Teletrans to develop, introduce and manage communications services on the open market in an attempt to create additional revenue.   The purpose of this Feasibility Study would be to help Transelectrica develop a business strategy for commercializing  these available telecommunications assets.         

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $186,100 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

The researchers must have experience and expertise in studying access to care, primary care, and health care outcomes as they relate to public policy.   Any other organization would have to spend significant resources to develop the data set that JHU/BSPH/DHPM already holds.  Therefore, JHU/BSPH/DHPM is the only responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  This requirement will be awarded under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated period of performance is for a six (6) month period.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), NINDS Technology Development Office plans to procure a system license and related support services from the MDL Information Systems Inc., 14600 Catalina Street, San Leandro, CA 94577.  The Anticonvulsant Screening Project (ASP), a project of the NINDS Technology Development office, is utilizing several MDL products to draw and store chemical structures in a NINDS-supported database. For the past several years, MDL ISIS/HOST has been utilized as the primary tool of structural and biological storage for the government's use in this effort.  This system was developed over a ten-year period specifically to interface with Isis Base, an MDL product.  Several in-house data management tools (ADDS2 system based on MDL ISIS/BASE, MDL ISIS/HOST and Oracle 9i) have been developed around the MDL platform of supported products such as ISIS/HOST and ISIS/BASE.  These systems are critical to operation of the ASP since they allow our laboratories to enter both chemical and biological test results directly into an interactive data management system.  The critical step is the linking of test results to structural information.  Structure-activity analysis is performed using input data.  The results allow our scientist to make critical decisions regarding further chemical modifications to the compounds.  The current purchase proposal is a continuation of the ASP efforts in translational drug discovery.  The goal is to provide public access to a portion of the database which has search/retrieve capabilities that will allow the public to use the NINDS-developed website in the most effective manner. The tools being considered for purchase are deemed the only available means to reasonably accomplish the Government's goals.  These products are highly proprietary in that the interaction among components is not compatible with other sources.  The system and services are considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  MDL Information Systems Inc.,  is the only organization known that has the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that the proposed system is currently in place and operating on the Web.  The NINDS will not consider statements that propose to develop a new system.  The statement and any other supporting information must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS to determine if the party meets the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 17, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   NAICS 511210

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas and wastewater infrastructure systems at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. System Descriptions: Natural Gas and Wastewater.  The base size is approximately 4,524,064 square feet, which includes 365 buildings and 874 military family housing units. Luke has it’s own wastewater treatment plant. The natural gas distribution system is supplied to Luke Air Force Base at three separate locations by 175 pound per square inch gauge gas mains owned by Southwest Gas Corporation. The natural gas piping on the main base is almost entirely polyethylene (PE). Steel piping is located in the Military Family Housing area. The piping is coated, rather than wrapped, and includes a cathodic protection system. The system contains 19 rectifiers. There is no physical on-base production of gas or natural gas wells. The meters owned by the Air Force are used for billing purposes. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 119,000 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 20 years old, with some as old as 50 years. The wastewater collection system consists of three major components; the sanitary sewer collection system, the wastewater treatment plant, and non-potable water reuse system. The sanitary sewer system consists of the gravity mains, cleanouts, lift stations, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer from the facility buildings and family housing on the base. A majority of the gravity collection mains and service laterals were installed in the 1940’s when the base was first constructed and in the 1950’s and 1960. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe, the force mains are Cast Iron, and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe. In the late 1970’s, additional base housing was installed. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe, the force mains are cement Mortar Lined Ductile Iron, and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe. Since the 1980’s, the base has made a concerted effort to install PVC for all sanitary sewer piping that are 8 inches or less. Consequently, most of the gravity mains, force mains and service laterals in these areas are composed of PVC. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed during the 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s are in fair to good condition. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed in the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s are in good to excellent condition. The wastewater treatment plant is designed to accept all of the sanitary flow from the sanitary sewer collection system through a 21-inch reinforced concrete pipe main line flowing from the site. Major improvements were conducted in 1994 to provide an advanced wastewater treatment plant that consistently met effluent discharge limitations and provide reuse water for discharge to the base golf course and parks for irrigation purposes. Improvements were designed to allow the facility to effectively treat an average daily flow of 1 million gallons per day with removal efficiencies in excess of 95% or better for Biochemical Oxygen Demand and suspended solids. The wastewater treatment plant has a certified laboratory capable of performing both process control and process monitoring tests. Since most of the wastewater treatment plant equipment was installed or reconstructed in the 1994 improvements, its overall condition is good to excellent. See Note 26.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Question 2:  What do you mean by 508 compliant?  Answer 2:  Effective June 25, 2001, the Federal government implemented Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. § 794(d)).

Answer 3:  We did not solicit through the GSA schedules and are not seeking a GSA contract.  Question 4:  Is there any information that I may need to craft the proper response other than the initial solicitation?  Answer 4: The solicitation notice contains the information needed for the submission.

QUESTION:  A bypass is mentioned, but not if it is to be internal to the UPS or external.  If it is to be external, would a two or three breaker bypass be required?

This UPS will be used to replace an existing UPS that has an external maintenance bypass and this will be re-used for the new UPS.  QUESTION:  The battery requested is a 15 minute battery in two strings.  Do you mean two strings equaling 15 minutes or 15 minutes for each of the two strings?  Are flame retardant batteries required?  ANSWER:  The battery must have a total capacity of at least 15 minutes for both strings or, stated another way, each string must have a capacity of at least 7.5 minutes.  The Government does desire flame retardant batteries and this requirement is hereby incorporated into the specifications via the issuance of this A001.  QUESTION:  The solicitation includes a statement that FEMA requests "extensive tests to ensure it is operating properly."  What constitutes extensive tests?  ANSWER:  The manufacturer's standard start-up tests will be acceptable to the Government.  QUESTION:  Customer training is required in the solicitation.  What is the minimum amount of training time required by the Government?   ANSWER:  A minimum of one hour is acceptable to the Government.  QUESTION:  Is there a specific bid form or other special bid documents to be filled out?  ANSWER:  Prospective sources can use their standard commercial forms in order to provide a response to the solicitation.

<DESC>NA WCAN  (ISR NET) Re-scope In accordance with ASD (C3I) Memorandum, SUBJECT: Radio Acquisition Policy,  dated August 28, 1998 and the current guidance dated 17 June 2003 Radio  Frequency (RF) Equipment Acquisition Policy the WCAN/ISR NET effort is no  longer a separate and individual technology solution.  This PIXS page will be  deleted effective 1 Oct 2003.      The policy addresses airborne networking solutions as follows:  "A recent Department of Defense study and continued technology advancements  indicate that expanding the scope of the JTRS/SCA to all waveforms above 2MHZ  frequency is now viable.  Therefore, to enhance our warfighting capabilities  and to improve integration of our communication systems through networking  technologies, the referenced Radio Acquisition Policy is hereby modified to  specifically reflect that all such systems, including those operating above 2  GHZ, are required to be developed in compliance with JTRS/SCA.  The policy is  now applicable to all communications waveforms/systems that operate at or above  2MHz.  By specifically expending this policy to airborne and ground-based  networks through an appropriate networking-services layer being developed for  JTRS/SCA radios.  All JTRS/SCA radios must be able to run the networking- services layer of the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), support internet  packed routing on the user and network sides of the radio, and must incorporate  National Security Agency (NSA) certified software programmable cryptology." If you have further questions or comments please contact the Program Manager,  Major Paul Simonich  (937) 255-9962 or the Contracting Officer, Mr. John Meyer  at 937-255-9249.

Overview:  AF 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, chapter 2, allows weapons simulators to be used to qualify personnel with weapons.  Weapons simulators are needed at all Air Combat Command (ACC) bases to provide continuing weapons qualification training when small arms ranges are closed for repair, ammunition is unavailable, or for northern tier bases when weather prohibits their use. During FY03 and FY04, 14 bases within ACC will be closing their ranges for major renovations. These renovations will last from weeks to months, according to the level of work being performed.  Considering ACC Combat Arms sections annually provide weapons qualification training to over 75K people, the lose of even a few days of training time can directly effect ours Wings arming ability. Weapons simulators can also be used to provide unique training opportunities for specific missions.  Units can use the systems to conduct judgmental training by the use of shoot-don't shoot scenarios or, by the use of authoring stations, they can create localized training scenarios to provide realistic training. AFI 36-2226 mandates simulator weapons must perform in all respects like actual weapons.  To meet the need of the command and AFI 36-2226 requirements, the following requirements were developed: 2.  Weapons requirements to be included in the price of the system: 2.1. System must have 10 M16A2 rifles, 10 M9 pistols, and 10 M4 carbines with flat top universal rails.2.2. Weapons must be capable of using owner installed optics, laser and inferred pointers as they were designed without interfering with system operations or affecting warranties. 2.3. Weapons, and system used to control weapons, must use accurate and validated ballistics for each type of weapon.  Ballistic data must have been previously validated by another federal agency.   The fact other federal agencies use a system does not mean its ballistics have been validated. 2.4. Weapons must operate and function the same as actual service weapons.  System operator must have the ability, at any time during scenarios, to inject real time malfunctions/stoppages. 2.5.  Air supplied to the weapons must be supplied by a light weight, easily portable, low noise, air compressor that can be locally repaired or replaced with an off-the-shelf model, if needed. 2.6. When a weapon becomes unserviceable, to minimize training interruption the immediate availability of replacement weapons (within 24 hours) from the vendor is mandatory.   2.7. At a minimum, all weapons must have a one year warranty on parts, labor, shipping and handling.  
2.8. All weapons must have a minimum life expectancy of 225,000 rounds.
2.9. At a minimum, weapons and supporting systems must maintain a minimum in-commission rate of 85%. 3. Simulator requirements to be included in the price of the system: 3.1. Software and licenses must be assigned per system, not location or individual, and there must not be any restrictions to software use.  Each system will be equipped with original copies of all programs used in the system in the event a system must be reloaded. 3.2. The system must be a complete “turnkey operation” to include all power cords, cables, and other items to make the system operational. 3.3. System must be able to operate on European or US electrical standards without the use of additional external transformers.  3.4. System must come equipped with a 19-inch color CRT monitor or a 17 inch color flat panel monitor.
3.5. Each system must have a built in capability to edit any and all scenarios or courses of fire (COF) used on the system.  Capability must allow for on-site, immediate customization and editing of scenarios/COF, ability to create infinite quantities of customized scenarios/COF, and the ability to create and edit localized specific scenarios/COF.  If special cameras, camcorders, accessory kits, or equipment is needed they will be provided by the vendor as part of the system. 3.6. Computer used to operate the system must use high speed processor and appropriate levels of memory to ensure no slipping, skipping, or pauses during scenarios/COF. 3.7. A high fidelity sound system must provide realistic sound and be fully controllable by the system operator at all times.
3.8. System must have global logistic and maintenance support capabilities in the event systems are deployed and require support. 3.9. System must have preloaded and ready-to-use AF-validated rifle Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) of fire, the Tactical Rifle Qualification Course (TRQC) of fire, and pistol AFQC.  Courses of fire will be validated by ACC prior acceptance of systems. 3.10.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION N00421-03-R-0134 ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 03 SEPTEMBER 2003.  AMENDMENT 0003 - N00421-03-R-0134 -- The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received to date.  NO EXTENSION IS PROVIDED TO THE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, which remains 1200 NOON on 15 September 2003 per amendment 0002.  

RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS

QUESTION 1 – Is there any preferential treatment given to U.S. small businesses?

ANSWER 1 – This requirement is NOT set aside for small businesses either in whole or in part.  However, as stated in the original synopsis/solicitation, if two or more small businesses respond with a technically capable offer, it will be converted to a small business set-aside and offers received from large businesses will not be further considered for award.  

QUESTION 2 – In the proposed synopsis, the DELIVERY paragraph identifies CLIN 0003 as a firm requirement.  Section B identifies CLIN 0003 as an option.  Section C identifies CLIN 0003 as “shall install, when ordered.”  Could you please clarify the status of CLIN 0003 as being either a firm requirement or as an option?  

ANSWER 2 – CLIN 0003 is a firm requirement.  A previous version of Section B and the Statement of Work was inadvertently posted to the NAVAIR Solicitation web site.  This error was corrected on 4 September 2003 by the posting of the correct Section B and Statement of Work on the NAVAIR Solicitation web site.  

QUESTION 3 – In the proposed synopsis, the DELIVERY paragraph identifies CLIN numbers above 0007.  Section B and Section C go up to CLIN 0007, but not beyond.  Could you please clarify the CLIN numbering structure?  

ANSWER 3 – See the response to Question 2.  

QUESTION 4 – In the proposed synopsis, RESPONSE DEADLINE, proposals are due no later than 3 PM EDT on 10 September 2003.  This allows interested parties only 6 working days to develop and submit a comprehensive proposal.  Is it possible to have the deadline wet one week later, to 17 September 2003?  

ANSWER 4 – Amendment 0002 extended the due date for receipt of proposals to 1200 NOON on Monday, 15 September 2003.  No further extensions to this date are planned.

QUESTION 5 – In the proposed synopsis, RESPONSE DEADLINE, proposals are to be submitted to NAVAIR/AD Contracts and a physical address is given.  Will NAVAIR accept electronic submissions?  If electronic submissions are acceptable, what is the preferred format and where should the submissions be sent?  

ANSWER 5 – Because of the short timeframe for receipt of proposals following the scheduled site visit on 11 September, the Government will accept electronic mail (e-mail) submissions of proposals.  Proposals shall be in a format that can be read with Microsoft Word 2000 or a PDF file for use with Adobe PDF for Acrobat Reader 5.0.  Proposals shall be submitted as set forth in the original combined synopsis/solicitation, together with a statement that acknowledges receipt of all posted amendments.  E-mail submissions shall be forwarded to the assigned Contract Specialist, Ms. Mary Roland, as follows:  RolandMC@navair.navy.mil. Ms. Roland will acknowledge receipt of proposals by return e-mail to the sender.  It shall be the responsibility of the offeror to ensure receipt of an acknowledgement by Ms. Roland to ensure their proposal has been received.  

QUESTION 6 – In SECTION C – DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT, second paragraph under Requirements:  “All work performed on these aircraft must be performed by FAA-certified mechanics (with appropriate ratings in accordance with 14 CFR 65) and the facility must be designated FAA Repair Station (or Canadian equivalent).  Will the Navy accept Air Transport Canada certified mechanics with appropriate ratings as equivalent to FAA-certified mechanics with appropriate ratings?  

ANSWER 6 – Yes, if the Air Transport Canada certification is equivalent to the FAA certification and ratings in 14 CFR 65.  

QUESTION 7 – CDRLs A001 through A010 reference SOW paragraphs under “5. CONTRACT REFERENCE.”  The SOW/SECTION B available on the NAVAIR website does not contain paragraph references as indicated on the DD Form 1423.  Where would I find the SOW paragraphs referenced on the CDRLs?  

ANSWER 7 – Revised CDRLs are provided as an attachment to this amendment.  Due to the restructuring of the Statement of Work during planning, Statement of Work paragraph reference numbers were eliminated; thus, the revised CDRLs simply use the Statement of Work as a reference, not specific paragraph numbers.  NOTE:  Some CDRL delivery dates have been revised to more accurately reflect the refurbishment plan.  

QUESTION 8 – Shall we still quote unavailable STC’s or will you amend the SOW?  

ANSWER 8 – The Statement of Work will not be revised.  We realize that some STC’s for the NU-1B may not be suitable, but all available STC’s were listed to allow the offeror to propose the best aircraft configuration.  Any STC listed in Section B/Statement of Work that is not appropriate to the aircraft, or is not available, should simply be noted as such in your proposal.  

QUESTION 9 – Some of the STC’s are for both aircraft.  Which one should be quoted?  

ANSWER 9 – Each aircraft configuration recommended by the offeror should be quoted.  That is, the offeror should quote each STC as it applies to each aircraft.  

QUESTION 10 – Is there a Discrepancy List already generated for CLIN 0001?  

ANSWER 10 – There is no Discrepancy List already generated for CLIN 0001.  Offerors shall price this CLIN for the inspection only as described in the Statement of Work.  After this inspection is complete, negotiation of any repairs shall be conducted under the Over-and-Above line item, CLIN 0039.  Taking this into consideration, CLIN 0039 will be revised at contract award to reflect a Government estimate of 500 man hours vice the 100 man hours currently estimated.  

QUESTION 11 – Do you need both the Garmin 530 and 430 installed in the same aircraft?  

ANSWER 11 – The Government requires that both the Garmin 530 and 430 be installed in each aircraft.    


END OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.  

NOTE:  All offerors must acknowledge receipt of amendments to this solicitation either by initialing and returning a copy of the amendment with their proposal or by acknowledging receipt and consideration of the amendments in the cover letter to their proposal.

<DESC>This is a request for information only. This is not a notice of RFP or RFQ issuance.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from commercial enterprises, which will provide data and voice connectivity throughout the Continental United Status (CONUS). 

The House has an existing Wide Area Network (WAN) consisting of both Frame Relay and Internet connections.  Over 750 remote CONUS-wide District Offices are connected to the House by individual Frame Relay circuits as well via VPN through independent Internet circuits.  These individual circuits use the District Office Local Loop and then are aggregated in networks on the Washington, D.C. Campus.

Conceptually, the solution could be a “fly away kit” and be used to bypass the District Office Local loop in the event it is unavailable (natural disaster of similar untoward event).  This will allow for remote connectivity and connection to the House WAN network.  The proposed solution may use either a Frame Relay or Internet connection to the House WAN.  A dual-use system is not required.  

Additionally, District Offices serve as the local site for Members and a significant number of local case work is communicated from the District Office to the House campus.

Respondents of interest to the House may be invited to demonstrate their system.  

Specific requirements:
1) The House desires a system to connect to a small number of these offices (approximately 10) in the case of a natural disaster or other untoward event.

2) The House desires a technology solution that will work with Cisco equipment.  The House has standardized on a Cisco based VPN and Frame Relay equipment.  
	
3) The proposed solution must support email (Outlook) and file transfer (voice traffic is a secondary choice). 
	
4) It must be independent of the District Office Local Loop.  
	
5) If an Internet connected solution is proposed, it must support IPSec Protocol and allow the use of at least one static Internet-routable IP address (the House remotely manages its VPN networks).
	
6) The proposed solution if portable must be overnight shippable (approximately 250 lbs or less) and able to be installed by 2 technicians (House staffed trained by the vendor).
	
7) If bandwidth solution it must be two way (transmit and receive) and made available on-demand for periodic testing of the kits (1 hour each month) and during two simultaneous untoward events (continuous, simultaneous use of two kits for up to 4 months in duration).
	
Proposed Information should include:
1)	Approach:  Frame Relay or Internet
2)	Link budgets and throughput option considerations if applicable.
3)	Hardware and Software equipment provided/required.
4)	Remote Management capabilities.
5)	Setup and configuration considerations.
For technical clarifications please contact Nelson Moe at 202-226-4103.

<DESC>The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking sources that currently produce, or have plans to produce, a Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) navigation system designed for use on vertical-lift aircraft. This is not a request for a proposal. It is the intent of this office to develop and procure a TF/TA passive navigation system that can be installed in several different USSOCOM aircraft. Anticipated award date is July 04. The development process would be expected to be completed within 36 months after contract award, with the first production systems expected 60 months after contract award. 150-250 systems will be required, depending on the aircraft selected to receive this system. The system will be required to form and fit into the existing TF radar locations on the MH-47, MH-60, and CV-22 aircraft, with only minor wiring modifications. The system will be required to be installed and interchangeable across the above aircraft without any extensive further modifications. The system must have the capability to provide safe terrain following guidance to avoid both natural and man-made obstacles, allowing flight at different low-level altitudes (100-1000 feet above ground level). The system should have an active terrain sensor, a passive system using digital terrain elevation data (DTED), and a blended mode of guidance (active and passive). The system must be able to take inputs from other sensors (i.e., obstacle avoidance) and correlate sensor data. The active sensor part of the system must utilize techniques, frequencies and/or waveforms that defeat beyond line of sight detectors. The LPI/LPD TF/TA system should be MIL-STD-1553 bus and Ethernet compatible, compatible with existing and planned aircraft displays and avionics, have built-in test capability, possess high reliability (1000 hours MTBF minimum), and have analog and digital video formats. The TF/TA system must be able to operate in adverse weather conditions in all types of terrain and over water. The system must include color weather detection, wind shear, beacon, and ground mapping modes. The TF/TA system must be compatible with aircraft electric systems. The system must meet military standard testing requirements as outlined in MIL-STD 461 and MIL-STD 810. Interested sources should submit written correspondence to the following address: United States Special Operations Command, Technology Applications Program Office, Building 401, Lee Blvd, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577 Attn: Kay Griffin. In order to be involved in market research being conducted for this requirement, interested sources must contact the Contracting Office as noted above and provide the following information: 1) Product brochures and/or technical data describing representative systems with the listed requirements. 2) Current production/development status of TF/TA systems in your company. 3) A listing of current users, if any, operating similar systems and point of contact information. 4) Current status of your facility’s security clearance: Top Secret or higher required. Provide CAGE code for verification. 5) A statement as to whether or not your firm would be willing to demonstrate the capabilities of your TF/TA and/or provide a detailed briefing to Government personnel for evaluation at your facility. Please respond by 30 Sep 2003. For more information, contact Kay Griffin at (757) 878-5223 x244, by email at: kgriffin@tapo.eustis.army.mil. All responses will be considered provided they meet the requirements of 1-5 above. Based on the responses, the Government may elect to conduct follow-on communications and/or meetings with the interested and responsible sources. The Government will conduct a TF/TA Passive Navigation System Industry Day at Fort Campbell, KY on 21 October 2003 to meet with interested sources. Registration of Industry Day is required. Contact Kay Griffin at 757-878-5223 X244 for information regarding Industry Day. Interested sources who responded to the Sources Sought notice of 8 August 2002 (USZA95-02-R-0036) must also respond to this Sources Sought notice.

GROWING-SEASON-BURN SEED HARVESTING CONTRACT


TP-01.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall furnish all labor and materials to remove approximately 600,000 lbs of native-plant-material seed and 600 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass seed.  The native-plant-material area encompasses approximately 2,484 acres and the lopsided Indiangrass area consists of 198 acres.

TP-02.  LOCATION OF PROPERTY: The areas to be harvested are located throughout the Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida.  Detailed maps will be provided to prospective bidders and the selected contractor will receive delineated aerial photos of harvest sites.

TP-03.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

The contractor will be allowed to harvest approximately 600,000 pounds of native vegetation and seed on the growing-season-burn tract and 600 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass on the other tract.

	a.  Growing-season-burn harvest.  The contractor will use a mower to harvest all vegetation down to a 16-inch height above the ground on the specified tracts.  Harvesting will be done in a pattern that alternates between mowed rows and unmowed rows, ensuring that approximately one-half of the site is harvested.  Cut material will be collected either by hand or with mechanized hay-making equipment.

	b.  Lopsided Indiangrass.  The contractor will collect seed either by hand or utilize a Flayal Vac or combine, cutting material at 30” or higher.  Harvesting of the Indiangrass will start 1 October and end 1 November.

	c.  The contract will start 1 October 2003 and end on 30 December 2003. 

	d.  Harvesting can begin within 10 working days after advance payment is made.  

	e.  The area shall be cleaned and then inspected by the Rangeland Specialist before moving to a new location.  Areas which are determined to be excessively wet by the Rangeland Specialist shall be worked at a later period of time.

	f.  Areas not designated for harvest may not be entered by the contractor.  If sites not in the contract are harvested or otherwise damaged through negligence by the contractor's operations, damages will be assessed at rate of $100.00 per acre of land impacted.  Damaged acreage determinations will be done by the Rangeland Specialist using Global Positioning System equipment.

TP-04.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

	a.  The Installation Supervisory Rangeland Specialist shall be contacted either in person or by telephone (863-452-4119, extension 305) prior to performing work under this contract.

	b.  To avoid any conflicts with other natural resources programs, endangered species, wetlands, or the flying mission of the Air Force, the Rangeland Specialist will approve all hauling roads and trailer locations.  The Rangeland Specialist will also determine which stand will be harvested first and the harvesting order of the other stands.  Harvesting or starting of work may be restricted to certain periods time to coincide with the natural resources management program or the military mission of the Air Force Range.  Harvesting can be conducted only Monday through Thursday.  Work may temporarily be halted or the contract terminated if a conflict, deemed serious by the Base Rangeland Specialist, occurs or was unforeseen.  If the contract is terminated through no fault of the contractor, the complete bid deposit submitted by the contractor shall be refunded.

	c.  All environmentally sensitive areas shall be avoided by all of the contractor's operations.  No activity of any sort shall be allowed by the contractor within the areas as designated on the attached map.  The Base Rangeland Specialist will identify the boundaries of these sensitive areas prior to initiation of work.

	d.  All work shall be accomplished by the contractor's personnel and with the contractor's equipment and materials.  All equipment needed for native seed harvesting operations shall be furnished, transported, and maintained by the contractor.

	e.  At all times when operations are in progress, the contractor shall have a representative readily available in the area who will be authorized to receive, on behalf of the contractor, any notices or instructions given by the Air Force in regard to performance under this contract.  He shall also have a copy of the map and technical provisions on the site at all times.

TP-05.  INSPECTION: All work is subject to inspection by the Air Force both during and after the contractor's operation.  Unsatisfactory work shall be corrected promptly.

TP-06.  DAMAGE TO AIR FORCE PROPERTY: Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid damaging trees, shrubs, roads, bridges, culverts, fences, utility lines, buildings, or other structures.  Any associated debris accumulated  from the harvest operations shall not be left in roads, trails, ditches, disc lines, or fire breaks.  Air Force property damaged beyond normal wear and tear shall be replaced at the original condition as directed, at no expense to the Air Force. All repairs will be inspected and accepted or rejected by the Air Force. The damage to hauling roads while standing water is present or road surfaces are soft from moisture will not be considered as normal wear and tear.

TP-07.  NEW CONSTRUCTION: All new construction by the contractor or subcontractor must be approved by the Air Force before construction begins.

TP-08.  FOREST FIRE SUPPRESSION: The contractor shall exercise due diligence both independently and in cooperation with the Air Force and will take all reasonable and practical action to prevent and suppress forest fires on the contract area or vicinity.  The contractor agrees to reimburse the Air Force for the cost of fire suppression incurred as a result of his negligence and/or willful acts.  All fires shall be reported immediately to the Base Rangeland Specialist.

TP-09.  EXAMINATION OF PREMISES: Bidders are expected to satisfy themselves as to the general location that may affect the cost of performance under this contract.  It is considered impractical to determine by other means the exact nature of the work, site conditions under which the work is to be performed, product breakdown and total quantity to be harvested.  The submission of a bid will be considered as certification that the site has been inspected and the nature of work and the effects of existing and/or adjacent work has been determined.  Inspection of the sites is invited between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (legal holidays excluded), by arrangements with the Base Rangeland Specialist, telephone  (863-452-4119, extension 305).

No trash of any sort (tires, oil buckets, etc.) shall be left on the ground at the end of the day.

TP-11.  PAYMENT AND BIDDING:

	a.  The basis for payment is pounds of native seed material. Payment shall be made weekly.  A check made payable to the "Treasury of the United States" along with invoice tickets shall be submitted to 347 RQW, DET 1, OL A/CEVN, Attention: R.

If this option is required, the  Rangeland Specialist will inform the contractor of the proper procedure and information needed to meet this requirement.

c.	All Indiangrass seed will be air dried for at least five (5) days before it is weighed at the Avon Park Air Force Range.  All seed will be weighed by a representative of the Air Force before it is taken off the installation.

d.	An advance payment of 30 percent of the total bid shall be made prior to 1 OCT 03.

TP-12.  UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE: The contractor is cautioned that unexploded
ordnance and unburned flares may exist within the contract areas.  The contractor shall assume full responsibility for such property and shall discharge the Government from any and all damages directly and indirectly resulting from such property.  The contractor also agrees to hold the Government harmless from any and all claims arising therefrom or incident thereto.  When found, these objects shall not be tampered with or removed.  The contractor shall immediately report these findings to the Base Rangeland Specialist so proper identification and disposal can be made by the Government.

TP-13.  COMPLETION:

	a.  The Base Rangeland Specialist shall notify the Contracting Officer when all operations required under this contract are satisfactorily completed.  In the event that the contractor is unable to complete removal of all native seed material designated for removal under this contract, the Rangeland Specialist may, if in his opinion the contractor made diligent effort to complete harvesting, recommend an extension of the contact as specified in Paragraph TP-03c.

	b.  All equipment, supplies, etc., belonging to or used by the contractor or subcontractor shall be removed from the Avon Park Air Force Range within 10 days after completion of work.  Rent will be charged at the rate of $20.00 per day per piece of equipment after the 10-day period has expired.

This requirement includes and 100% option for a duplicate Mass Spectrometer. SPECIFICATIONS: 1)  The mass spectrometer used shall be the scanning magnetic sector type for high stability of analysis and resistance to hydrocarbon contamination. The scanning shall be accomplished by varying the intensity of the magnetic field. The magnet shall be a laminar-type magnet to reduce eddy concurrent flow. The precision of the analyzer shall be better than  0.001% standard deviation on a 1% Argon concentration.  All peaks over the entire mass range of the mass spectrometer shall be capable of being monitored with a single Faraday detector rather than requiring multiple Faraday detectors and a limited magnetic scan range. 2)  The ion energy to extract ions from the ion source shall be at least 1000 V to ensure high transmission rates, i.e. better sensitivity and reduced contamination.  As a standard, the analyzer shall have a temperature-controlled ion source, heated multi-point inlet system and heated capillary tube to eliminate cold spots. 3)  The mass spectrometer shall be capable of automatically selecting from among at least 32 different inlet streams under software control using a multi-stream sampling valve.  This inlet sample system shall be designed to give a zero dead or minimal dead volumes and continuous sample flow to eliminate sample contamination (cross-talk) and to reduce cold spots.  The inlet system shall be provided with a minimum of 3-year warranty on parts and labor. 4)  The mass spectrometer shall be designed and built to ISO 9001 standards. 5)  The mass spectrometer shall be provided with one general- purpose 4-way calibration panel to allow the mass spectrometer to automatically shut off gas streams from inlets when they are not being sampled.  The mass spectrometer shall be capable of accommodating up to four 4-way calibration panels. 6)  Gases shall be detectable from 100% to less than 20 ppm using a Faraday detector. 7)  The mass spectrometer shall include an electron multiplier for monitoring dilute species with concentrations of less than 1 ppm, with automatic switching between the Faraday detector and the multiplier. 8)  The analyzer cabinet shall be provided with a pullout tray for complete access to facilitate easy maintenance.  All electronic cards shall to be modular with clear identifications and on-line diagnostic software to ensure optimum performance and minimum downtime.  Each electronic card shall have its own individual test routine. 9)  The analyzer shall be supplied with standard fully digital amplifier circuits to eliminate gain switching and to correct zero drift before each measurement. 10)  The analyzer shall be available with standard analog and digital I/O?s and as well as options for Modbus and OPC protocol for direct communications to DCS. 11)  The mass spectrometer shall be capable of unattended stand-alone operation in rigorous industrial environments and must maintain 1% absolute accuracy and stability, without recalibration, during a temperature variation of 20 degrees F over 12 hours, for all peaks with normalized concentrations greater than 1% volume concentrations in the absence of interfering peaks. In climate-controlled environments, the same accuracy and stability shall apply for a period of at least 24 hours. 12)  The mass spectrometer shall include dual filaments, with automatic switchover to the remaining filament should the first filament fail, in order to minimize data loss during unattended runs. 13)  The mass spectrometer shall allow at least 32 derived values to be calculated from ?raw data?  (detector outputs directly proportional to the ion currents) as well as from gas concentrations. 14)  The mass spectrometer shall be capable of covering the mass range from 1 to 200.  A low-resolution slit, with a mass resolution (defined as the mass at the center of the peak divided by the peak full width in mass units at 10% maximum height) of 25 or less shall be available for peaks in the mass range of 1 to 20. A high-resolution slit shall be available for peaks with masses greater than 20. Switchover from the low-resolution to the high-resolution slit shall be done automatically during runs in which both low-mass and high-mass peaks are monitored. 15)  The mass spectrometer shall be fully controllable by a remote computer using a modem.  This requires that all operations of the mass spectrometer be controlled by computer and there be no manual controls on the system. 16)  All software upgrades shall be done via the modem or via a compact disk (i.e. no firmware on EPROM). 17)  The vendor shall include a standard expert system software to provide on-line expert help will all aspects of the mass spectrometer analyzer.  A comprehensive tutorial shall describe all the operating principles of the mass spectrometers and ancillary equipment including the comprehensive use of animations to enhance self-training.  In addition an on-line manual shall be provided i.e. a complete parts and maintenance manual including electronic schematics with circuit descriptions, connector pin-outs and wiring schedules. Troubleshooting guides included shall ensure that tests are made in a logical sequence simply by following the maintenance steps described in the software. 18)  Operating software shall operate under Windows 95 through Windows XP. The operating software shall include at least the following functions: multiple trend views of data, data storage in CSV or HTML format to enable reviewing Excel, multiple methods, multi-tasking and multi-level security. 19)  The software shall allow individual streams to be to be set up and configured differently.  Multiple methods shall be available per stream. 20)  In the event of power failure, the mass spectrometer shall shut down in a fail-safe manner and automatically restart on the resumption of power. 21)  The software shall have comprehensive diagnostics and be able to monitor and display a minimum of 50 mass spectrometer parameters. 22)  The mass spectrometer shall operate in a true stand-alone mode.  This means that the mass spectrometer must be able to continue to analyze, calibrate and communicate to external control systems when disconnected from the PC data system. 23)  The offeror shall supply details of its normal commercial warranty. The extent and duration of this warranty will be considered during proposal evaluation and may prove dispositive if proposal prices are within a 5% range. 24)  The price of the mass spectrometer shall include the initial installation and testing by the vendor and travel costs associated with the installation, and two copies of the operating manuals. The installation, testing, and travel shall be shown as separate line items in the proposal.
