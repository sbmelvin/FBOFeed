<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) has been tasked to initiate a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office, Patuxent River, MD, specifically, Boeing-Philadelphia.  Boeing Philadelphia is part of the joint program office of Bell-Boeing.  The proposed BOA shall cover all peripheral equipment, including provisioned items for repair of repairables, spare and repair parts, technical manuals, support equipment, miscellaneous logistics support services and data for these items as they become necessary for the program are also included.  The Government intends to negotiate this BOA under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Bell-Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer of the V-22 aircraft.  Bell-Boeing remains the only Support Equipment designer/integrator that has all the required proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreements necessary to design, develop and manufacture Organizational (O) and Intermediate (I) Level Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE).  As part of this effort, Bell Boeing will be required to integrate changes to the PSE (both safety of flight and ECP/VECP) that are identified on the aircraft contract.  While drawings do exist for some of these items, no other source has sufficient technical data, drawings, software, combined aircraft and PSE expertise, as well as trained technical personnel to fully integrate the required PSE with the aircraft platform.    All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which may or may not be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as part of an ongoing research project to build a solid-state quantum computer using Josephson Junctions, plans to support a program of study to investigate microwave pulse sequences for the control of Josephson qubits, particularly for control of a coupled quantum bit system. The project requires control of the quantum state of the Josephson system, which is achieved by applying a precise sequence of pulsed microwaves.  Such sequences have been developed for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) -based quantum computing efforts, and our present understanding of the problem is that this knowledge can be applied to our Josephson system. This program will develop the basic theory for the pulse sequences; in particular for building either a Bell state measurement experiment, a controlled-not gate, or a phase-gate.  The initial stage of this work will be theoretical, with a goal of understanding the optimal approach for performing and measuring these gates. Work may also be performed, if appropriate to the end goals of this work, to optimize the construction and operation of single quantum bits in order to maximize coherence.  Qualifications include knowledge, as evidenced by publications, of the implementation of quantum computation algorithms, and their application to Josephson quantum systems.  The place of performance will be the NIST Boulder labs and the period of performance will be 12 months. It is the Government's belief that the skills of the researchers engaged by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology uniquely qualify them for this work. They have performed some of the first and most complex experiments on implementing quantum algorithms.  In addition, they have recently written a paper on using NMR type of techniques for the Josephson system.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (not to exceed $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. The qualifications statement should be submitted on or before July 8, 2003.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops\#REFERENCE . Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be July 9, 2003.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Microarray Facility, Advanced Technology Center (ATC) plans to procure on a sole source basis human, mouse, rat, drosophila, and yeast genome oligonucleotide sets,  with Qiagen/Operon Technologies, Inc. 1000 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 108, Alameda, CA 94501.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  
One of the ATC's missions is the manufacturing of quality micro-arrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, providing training protocols and technical support to NCI researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  High density DNA micro-array technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences.  These high density DNA micro-arrays have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on the genes of human, mouse, and other organisms.   As new oligonucleotide sets are introduced by Qiagen/Operon, they shall be added to the contract for ordering as needed.  Period of Performance:  A firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, type contract is anticipated for the aforementioned oligonucleotides. Base year (12 months), plus four (4) one-year options are anticipated.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov. 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar. 2000) apply.  Qiagen/Operon is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned oligonucleotides, that can offer large oligonucleotide sets of 70 bases (70 mers) in size that can be used for large scale expression  and complex expression studies.  The NCI has significant experimental investment in array technologies and believes the Qiagen/Operon oligonucleotides are best suited to continue with experiments in progress without interruptions.   This is not a request for competitive request.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  This statement must list all oligonucleotides available and shall quality, size, and encompass the genes that make up the oligo set.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, (local Washington DC time) on July 3, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Forest Service is in need of conifer cone collection services in order to obtain tree seed used to restore and reforest lands.  The purpose of this contract is to provide services for the collection of reforestation and tree improvement seed if a viable cone crop exists.  All contract areas are located on the Blue Mountain Acquisition Management ZAP, which includes the Umatilla, Wallowa-Whitman and Malheur National Forests.  Definite work areas have not been defined, but will be within mixed coniferous forested stands.  This solicitation will result in a unique arrangement that includes multiple-award, multiple-year, indefinite-quantity contracts with no minimum obligation.  This is a unique arrangement where the Government has stated a realistic estimated total quantity. This estimated quantity is not a representation that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal from year to year. Utilization of the this type of contract has been determined to be appropriate for acquiring cone collection needs as the Government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities that will be ordered during the contract period. The specific areas will be defined and maps and quantities will be provided when a task order is issued.  The Government will award a maximum of five contracts, not to exceed $100,000 each.  Contractors quoting on more than one item will be expected to be prepared to perform work on all items concurrently.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the areas specified in the task order. All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services will be performed in a timely manner.  The solicitation will be posted electronically to FedBizOpps on or about July 7, 2003.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Emergency Preparedness & Response (EP&R), National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Emergency Management Institute (EMI) has an Emergency Management Higher Education Project, which seeks to develop a stand-alone, 3-4 credit hour, 45 contact-hour, essentially ready-to-teach, classroom-based, graduate-level college course on Floodplain Management.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The associated NAICS code is 611430, Professional Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.0 million [average annual receipt for three preceding fiscal years].  The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study, if not a degree, in emergency management as well.  This will help to contribute to the professionalization of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well, all of which contributes to building disaster resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within United States colleges and universities.  Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address:  http://training.fema.gov.EMIWeb/edu/highedbrief_course2.ppt.  Course developers shall be able to provide evidence of holding a doctoral degree from an accredited college or university, demonstrate experience teaching hazard, disaster and floodplain or emergency management-related courses at the upper division or graduate college level at an accredited university within the past five years (provide course titles, dates and copies of most relevant course syllabi), demonstrate knowledge of “comprehensive emergency management,” demonstrate awareness of the four perspectives relevant to floodplain management, demonstrate background, credentials and expertise in floodplain management issues, and demonstrate familiarity with the floodplain management literature.  A listing of the completed Emergency Management Higher Education Project courses can be found at the following website: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/highedbrief_course2.ppt.   Additional information concerning the Emergency Management Higher Education Project can be accessed at: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/.  A number of different perspectives are important to an understanding of the flooding problem in the United States and what to do about it.  This course will seek to highlight four of those:  (1) Hazard Risk Perspective-this perspective focuses on what can be done to lower risk to flood losses; (2) Ecological and Environmental Perspective; (3) Geoscience Perspective; and (4) Public Policy Perspective.  In addition to addressing and weaving these perspectives throughout the course, the course shall also include, among other subject areas: (1) An overview of the growth of the flood hazard and countermeasures in the United States; (2) Analysis of National Flood Insurance Program, history, legislative intent, benefits, and challenges; (3) Floodplain management as a profession—evolution, challenges, and future prospects; (4) The role of the emergency manager in floodplain management; and (5) Flood mapping, modeling and loss estimation.  Through development of a graduate-level Floodplain Management college course EMI seeks to expand the knowledge base of future and practicing emergency managers in the practices and intricacies of floodplain management, contribute to the professional development of practicing floodplain management and related personnel, interest college students in entering the field of floodplain management upon graduation, and interest universities in the development of Floodplain Management Certificate Programs through the provision to them of the core course in such a certificate program.  The course shall be developed within the philosophical context of “Building Disaster Resistant and Resilient Communities,” which places priority emphasis on prevention, mitigation and vulnerability reduction.  The course shall also be developed within the context of seeking balance between the two bi-polar approaches to United States emergency management – the dominant “technocratic” approach and the more recent “social vulnerability” approach.  The course shall contain more lecture material than can be used in a standard 45 contact hour course in order to provide flexibility to the user.  The course shall fulfill the requirements of a standard 3-semester hour college course at the graduate level.  Since all deliverables shall be provided in hard copy and in electronic format for distribution via the Internet, all deliverables shall be Section 508 compliant.  Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order is anticipated.  The award will be made based on Best Value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth herein and in the Request for Quotation Package.  Quotes will be due 30 days from the release date of the Request for Quotation package.  Potential offerors must request the Request for Quotation package in writing no later than July 11, 2003 to:  Teresa Dingle, Contract Specialist, Department of Homeland Security, Emergency Preparedness & Response, NETC Acquisition Section, E114B, 16825 S.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for corporate capabilities relevant to the following requirements.  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in support of the Department of Defense (DoD), requires the operation and maintenance of MDA airborne sensors and platforms used for testing the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and its elements.  Airborne sensor systems currently operated by MDA are the High ALtitude Observatories (HALO-I/II) and Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) aircraft.  The HALO-I is a Gulfstream IIB aircraft with multiple sensors viewing through optical windows, used for data collection in the visible through long wave IR (LWIR) spectral regions.  Three sensor stations accommodate the Infrared Imaging System (IRIS) primary sensor and a mix of user-defined sensors in the remaining two stations known as Alpha and Beta.  HALO-II is also a Gulfstream IIB aircraft with a cupola mounted to the top of the fuselage that allows for open port viewing with a multiband sensor system to collect radiometric and photo documentation data in the visible through LWIR spectral regions.  HALO-II also allows for optical window viewing by cabin sensors.  WASP is a DC-10 aircraft modified with three pressure vessels to allow open port or closed cabin optical window sensor viewing.  WASP will accommodate a Prime Sensor System (PSS) for data collection and guest captive-carry seeker/sensor systems.  The WASP PSS is similar in design and capability to the HALO-II primary sensor.  Operations and maintenance of all current and future MDA airborne sensor platforms will be required.  Support requirements include the planning and execution of all aspects of sensor suite and aircraft operation and maintenance for successful conduct of flight test missions to include, but not limited to, program management support, aircraft support, mission support, data reduction and analysis support, sensor systems engineering support and operations and maintenance, and system improvement and modernization, as required.  Accordingly, MDA is requesting information from industry or industry teams that describes or demonstrates their core capabilities and expertise in each of the following areas to include: 1) operation and maintenance of a wide range of visible and infrared (IR) sensor suites with data collection capability from ultra-violet (UV) through the LWIR spectral regions; 2) operation and maintenance of aircraft systems to provide all aircraft-related services to include all aircraft operations, maintenance, modifications, flight and ground crew support personnel, facilities, and aircraft flight worthiness and flight safety certifications; 3) airborne test measurement operations, optical signature data collection, tactical communications, and processing of the raw data into radiometric calibrated test data or other forms as required by the user; 4) mission planning and execution to include pre-mission planning and analyses, sensor selection and integration and calibration, post-mission data reduction, data reviews, and data analysis support; 5) overall planning, management, and execution of test missions to meet all test objectives; 6) similar activities to conduct non-test operational missions, as required; and 7) additional aircraft and/or sensor engineering support to include aircraft/sensor system and/or component development, acquisition, modifications, integration, operations and maintenance, and capability upgrades and improvement, as required.  As an initial step in the RFI process, MDA/TER will conduct an Industry Day on Tuesday, July 8, 2003, 9:00 –11:30 A.M. (8:30 check-in).  The location is 1101 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, in Arlington, VA 22209 (Northrop Grumman/TASC).  The purposes of the Industry Day are to provide an overview of current and developing MDA/TER airborne sensor systems, and to discuss in greater detail the support requirements and corporate capabilities needed to ensure 100% accomplishment of test objectives for all missions.  Briefings and discussion will be conducted at the collateral SECRET classification level.  Interested parties with a capability and interest in meeting all or part of these requirements are invited to participate, and may be represented by not to exceed three persons per company.  Registration for Industry Day is required and is accomplished by emailing the names of attendees and contact information (including email address and phone number) to Mr. Harry Burket, Email Harold.Burket-contractor@mda.osd.mil, Phone (703) 695-8068, no later than June 30, 2003.  Clarifying questions concerning this RFI may be submitted in advance of Industry Day, with official responses to be distributed to all participants.  Such questions should be directed in writing to Mr. Larry Wingfield, FAX (703) 695-5760, Email Larry.Wingfield@mda.osd.mil, by June 30, 2003.  To provide an opportunity for companies to more fully communicate about issues they feel may be unique to them, one-on-one meetings (thirty minute time limit) may be scheduled to follow the general meeting.  One-on-one discussions will begin at 1:00 P.M. on July 8, 2003, continuing on July 9, if required.  Requests for one-on-one meetings should be made with registration.  Directions to the Northrop Grumman/TASC facility and information about local hotels will be provided upon request.  The facility is only two blocks from the Rosslyn Metro Station.  An attendance list will be provided to all Industry Day attendees.  Visit request/security clearance information must be faxed to Northrop Grumman/TASC, Attn: Michele Irving, Security Specialist, FAX (703) 449-1098 and confirmation at (703) 633-8300, ext. 4759, no later than June 30, 2003. Those without security information on file will be denied entry into the Industry Day presentations and discussion.  Designate the purpose of the meeting as “Airborne Sensors Industry Day.”  The Government shall not be liable for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  Corporate capability summaries in response to this RFI should be sent electronically (in Word or PDF format) to  Mr. Larry Wingfield, Phone (703) 697-4131, FAX (703) 695-5760, Email Larry.Wingfield@mda.osd.mil, at MDA/TE no later than August 25, 2003.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) has a requirement to increase the labor hours and revise the statement of work on a contract previously awarded to Empyrean Services of Warrenton, VA.  This increase in hours will allow for the continuation of services for technical support in the development, distribution and training for the major Insurance Operations Department Policy and Procedures manuals. 

The services required include, but are not limited to modification and compilation of existing documents into the appropriate publishing outputs as well as the ongoing archiving and appropriate internal referencing of versions.  Version control efforts will be modified to reflect single source documentation implementation.  Ongoing efforts for standardizing existing documents by topics will be enabled and importing conversion efforts for existing documents into the common database will be continued. Help desk Support for fielded IOD Manuals, LAN Support and related programming for fielded manuals, helpfile integration and creation are also areas of continued effort.  In view of the provider's familiarity with the procedures manuals effort already completed,  it is PBGC's belief that  it would be in our best interest for the current provider to complete this work within the exisiting timeframes under the contract.  This is not a request for proposal.

NIST is not responsible for late delivery due to the added security measures.  In addition, offerors/quoters who do not provide 24-hour notification in order to coordinate entrance to the NIST campus must assume the risk of not being able to deliver offers/quotes on time.  The Government is not responsible for the amount of time required to clear unannounced visitors, visitors without proper identification and without complete information that would allow delivery (i.e. point of contact, telephone POC, bldg., room number, etc.)  If 24 hour notification was not provided, it is suggested you’re your company representative or your courier service arrive at NIST at least 90 minutes prior to the closing time in order to process entry to the campus through the visitor center and complete delivery.  Notice must include the company name, name of the individual making the delivery, and the country of citizenship of the individual.  For non-US citizens, the following additional information will be required:  title, employer/sponsor, and address.  Please ensure that the individual making the delivery brings photo identification, or they will be denied access to the facility.  Faxed quotes will NOT be accepted. ***

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This concludes the questions/comments and answers/responses to the draft RFP.  

The draft RFP and responses to comments are illustrative of what we expect in the formal RFP. However, the formal RFP will stand-alone and nothing else (i.e., not the draft RFP, not the questions and answers from the draft RFP, no verbal statements, etc.) will serve as authoritative sources of formal RFP guidance.  Only the formal written RFP will be official. 

Many of you have called regarding the formal RFP wanting to know specifics beyond what we have stated about release date timing so you may plan for it.  Here is what we know: the formal RFP is expected this summer (2003).  It is not expected in June.  We hope to have it out as soon as possible. Please continue to watch this site for news of the formal RFP.

This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions from venders. 1.

Has NASA previously procured 1/100 scale models of the ISS?	ANSWER:  NASA/JSC has purchased 4 1/100 models in the past. 3.	If this model was previously procured, what was the most recent per unit cost?     ANSWER:	$2,500 per 1/100 scale model. 4.  Do we need to send you pictures of previously completed defense and military projects?	 ANSWER:  This is up to you if you think it will substantiate your firm's ability to produce high fidelity, quality products.   5.	Do you see the need for protective carrying cases with these models? ANSWER:  The shipping and packaging requirement is found in the RFQ under JSC terms and conditions. 6.  Where do I find on the quote information on line for: RFQ #: 9-BJ4-V40-03-01Q INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) SCALE MODELS ANSWER:  The synopsis site is.    http://www.fedbizopps.gov/    select Go at Finding Business Opportunities. The solicitation number is 9-BJ4-V40-03-01Q. 7.  May I call you to learn how to properly respond to your solicitation? ANSWER:  Provide a quote NLT Monday June 23, 2003 letting us know how you meet the requirements.  Because of the competitive nature of this procurement, we cannot provide one-person information that isn't provided to all the competitors.   8.  Is there a web site or other location to go to download or look at the drawings to be used to make the model in order to get it to the correct scale and level of detail? ANSWER:  An amendment was issued to the solicitation that has the web site.   9.  Will the due date for proposals be extended?   ANSWER:	Yes, until Monday, June 23, 2003.   10.  Will NASA provide drawings of the space station for the model maker to use, or must one rely on their own resources?	  ANSWER:  Any information on the models, i.e. drawings, graphics, measurements, can be obtained on the ISS web site link at www.spaceflight.gov  or, if you have your own resources, that will be okay; however, your resources should conform to what we have on our web site. 11.  What is the desired delivery date? ANSWER:  2 months after authority to proceed (ATP) 12.  How are the models to be displayed, is a case required for each? ANSWER:  The models should come with their own stand; NASA will provide any other display case. 13.  I submitted a bid prior to this modification announcement and am with the impression that I should re-submit my bid acknowledging this amendment.  Is this so?	       ANSWER:  We have extended the delivery date for proposals with this amendment.   You may leave your offer in as is, or, revise it, and provide the new offer on the new due date. Please acknowledge with an e-mail acknowledgement of amendments per the RFQ. 14.	Do the bidders get the color scheme and decals called out from you or from the web?	     ANSWER:  Everyone is bidding to the same set of specifications on the website at  www.spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/models/index.html. 15.  Also, as I understand it, the bidder is responsible for the base design, model layout on the base and final attachment to the base, am I also to understand that the strut system and model assy have to be detachable. ANSWER:  As stated in the solicitation, "  Individual modules, solar panels, truss structures and other key elements of the ISS shall be made detachable to the overall configuration of the ISS to enable the models to reflect the actual and current configuration while in orbit (required)"; style of model base left to the builder.  16.  This would replicate the space station more correctly, correct?	 ANSWER:   YES. 17.  The question arises -does this [unable to deliver in 2 months] exclude us from submitting a quote? Does the fact that we are Canadian exclude us? Having never submitted a proposal within this system are there any obvious pitfalls you might warn me about? ANSWER:  The Government's delivery schedule is 2 months after authority to proceed as stated in the synopsis.  Offeror's run the risk of nonconformance to the solicitation if they do not meet this requirement.	The Government reserves the right to amend the delivery schedule at a later date.  This is a small business set aside for small business concerns.  Canadian firms are  not considered a "small business concern" as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, although neither of these precludes you from bidding. 18.  Within the description of the model, can you provide a bit more information regarding the level of detail?	 ANSWER:  The level of details is up the discretion of the bidder. 19.  Some guidance on how much detail is needed would be greatly appreciated. ANSWER:  These models are for the Public Affairs office and the level of details is up to the bidder.  20.  What are the terms regarding deposit and progress payments?	   ANSWER:  This will be a fixed price contract, no progress payments, or advance payments. 21.  Regarding the required delivery date, "2 months ATP", what does the term "ATP" mean?   ANSWER:  ATP = Authority to proceed.  22.  Can you give us some idea of when the contract is expected to be awarded?   ANSWER:  Within 3 or 4 weeks.	 23.  Packing:	Is each model to be packed as a separate unit?	  ANSWER:  Packing shall be in accordance with the JSC terms and conditions on the RFQ delivered to the Johnson Space Center.  24.  What is the purpose of the models? Is there a certain focal point for the models? This can help us to determine the fidelity and level of detail required.        ANSWER:  These models are for our Public Affairs organization.  They are for public showing either at events or at media conferences, in schools, at exhibitions, etc.  Lee A. O'Neil, is the focal point for this procurement.   25.  What are the specific requirements for the models, such as:  Will there be a need for any articulating parts (i.e. SSRMS, MBS,CETA Carts, deployable solar arrays ect.)? ANSWER:  There is no specific requirement for articulated parts, however, they must reflect current configuration and be able to show assembly as it occurs. 26.  What level of detail is needed ( i.e. cameras, antennas, hand rails, cables, gapple fixtures, scuff plates, docking targets etc.)? ANSWER:	Models shall be made of plastic and metal and shall reflect current markings of the ISS.  Individual modules, solar panels, truss structures and other key elements of the ISS shall be made detachable to the overall configuration of the ISS to enable the models to reflect the actual and current configuration while in orbit (required) 27.  What painting level is required ( i.e. all white modules with other specific colors necessary for the detailed parts (if needed) versus all colors reflecting the original ISS on orbit and future configuration module and elements colors)?  ANSWER:  This is left to the discretion of the builder.  28.  Will the Truss sections need to be fabricated as solid pieces or open, showing debris shields, individual strut members and other interior parts? ANSWER:  This is left to the discretion of the builder .  29.  Will decals be acceptable for certain details?... If so, what details? ANSWER:  Yes, decals are acceptable, the detail is up to you.   30.  Are there any other special parts such as the ESP needed? ANSWER:  NO.  31.  What type of support structure is required?   ANSWER:  A base is required to display the base and should be large enough to adequately display the model.  The height, length, and material used is left to the discretion of the builder.	 32.  Is there a need for a Shuttle model?	If yes, what fidelity?	  ANSWER:  No, not at this time. 33.  What are the delivery package requirements? Are foamed cases needed for transporting models on a regular bases? ANSWER:  The requirements for packaging can be found in the RFQ under JSC terms and conditions.  34.	Is there a delivery date set?  ANSWER:  2 months after authority to proceed. 35.  How do we find out more about and what are the procedures to Solicitation Number: 9-BJ4-V40-03-01Q ?

All information must be received by the date indicated for receipt of proposals in order to be considered.   37.  What is a GSA contracting number?  FAR 52.212-3 representations and certifications information and how to register.  2) are these items taxable. ANSWER:  GSA is the General Services Administration  (GSA).  They often have contracts already in place that other Government agencies may purchase items from.  The Reps and Certs will only be required from the actual awardee.  And the awardee will be required to provide a Tax Id number. 38.  Has NASA procured an ISS model at a scale of 1/100 in the past and if so, in what quantity? ANSWER:  NASA/JSC has purchased 4 1/100 models in the past. 39.  Are you looking for a commercially available plastic model kit that is professionally assembled and finished, or a custom built item from current drawings/info?  (A commercial available model can be assembled and finished much more cost effectively and faster than a custom manufactured model).  ANSWER:  We are looking for a model that can reflect the current ISS configuration (the way it looks today), and then have pieces added as they are taken and assembled on orbit.	Kits do not offer this option. 40.  If it is a custom built item, are drawings and current configuration/marking information available?  This data is required to develop accurate pricing. ANSWER:  Information, drawings are available from many on site web sites, including the NASA site.  41.  If a custom built item is required, how flexible is the delivery schedule of 8 weeks?  ANSWER:  The Government's delivery schedule is 2 months after authority to proceed as stated in the synopsis.  Offeror's run the risk of nonconformance to the solicitation if they do not meet this requirement.  The Government reserves the right to amend the delivery schedule at a later date.	42.  Will a scale of 1/144 be acceptable instead of 1/100?  1/144 scale is readily available. ANSWER:  To meet our program needs 1/100th scale is required. 43.	Will a model base, acrylic dust cover, custom carrying case, etc. be required? ANSWER:  A model base is requested.  The shipping and packaging requirement is found in the RFQ under JSC terms and conditions. The due date for receipt of offers extended until Monday June 23, 2003. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 20, 2003.

<DESC>Amendment No. 1 has been reposted under the name of Amendment No. 1 Reposted.
 The Department of Commerce (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) requires ongoing scientific and technical support for its Office of Research and Applications (ORA) site in Camp Springs, MD.  ORA is the office within NESDIS that provides guidance for the development and evolution of spacecraft and sensors to meet future needs.  Through its divisions, ORA conducts atmospheric, climatic, and oceanographic research on the use of satellite data for monitoring environmental characteristics and their change.  ORA plans, coordinates, and conducts research and development activities with other parts of NESDIS and NOAA and other Government agencies, universities and international groups.  ORA provides meteorological and oceanographic satellite products and services to users world-wide. 

This requirement is for scientific support, often at the Ph.D. or Master's degree level, with experience in remote sensing and interpretation of satellite data for weather, ocean and climate systems.  The Contractor shall provide scientific support for the design, development, testing, implementation, validation and documentation of algorithms for deriving atmospheric, oceanic and land surface variables from research and operational satellite observations.  This support shall involve occasional participation in field experiments including those on ships and aircraft platforms.  The Contractor shall participate in technical conferences where the results of this research are presented.  These services are currently performed by a staff of physical scientists including  meteorologists, oceanographers, hydrologists, physicists, engineers, mathematicians, programmers and system analysts.

This is a competitive 8(a) requirement.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690 applies.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541690 is $6.0 million.  The Government contemplates awarding one hybrid fixed price/cost plus award term contract for scientific and technical support services to a Section 8(a) source whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Government's estimated cost is $60 million over a seven and a half (7 1/2) year period. 

All inquiries should be submitted in writing by e-mail to Edith.L.Jones@noaa.gov or by faxogram to (301) 713-4155 referencing RFP No. DG133E-03-RP-0001. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis 
Version 3, Revised: 19 Jun 03

The Environmental Contracting Division (311th HSW/PKV), Brooks AFB, Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Worldwide Environmental Restoration and Construction (WERC) program.  This is a major source selection for environmental restoration and construction at sites located on DoD (primarily Air Force) installations worldwide, as well as any other sites for which the AFCEE customers have responsibility.  

Resulting contracts will provide multiple, full service engineering and construction capabilities.  Requirements will be primarily environmental that include completion of a conceptual design, construction, implementation, demolition, repair, emergency response, and operation and maintenance tasks.  Traditional engineering and construction needs are a secondary requirement and include construction, demolition, repair, emergency response, and operation and maintenance tasks.  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements thereto.  The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity  (IDIQ) with multiple contracting arrangements (i.e. FFP, FPIF, CPAF, CPFF, CPIF).  Multiple contract awards are anticipated with a total program ceiling of $4 billion.  We anticipate awarding approximately 20 contracts.  Approximately one (1) to eight (8) contracts may be awarded under small business set-aside procedures, and approximately one (1) to three (3) contracts may be awarded under 8(a) set-aside procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility as a small business.  For purposes of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, this effort is construed as construction by special trade.  Therefore, small business concerns must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of material, with its own employees.  Because this acquisition exceeds $10 million, there is an exclusion to the teaming affiliation rules.  This exclusion allows for first-tier subcontractor’s participation towards the 15% of this clause.  For the small business set-aside, the required 15% of the cost of labor may be performed by the small business prime and its first-tier small business subcontractors.

We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 27 Jun 03.  The RFP will be issued via the FedBizOps and posted on the AFCEE website, WERC information page, at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/werc/.  Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this RFP require clarification(s) to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing within 10 days of publication of the RFP.  

All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP.  The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address.  Inquiries may be directed to bea.delossantos@brooks.af.mil, voice (210) 536-4419; connie.massenburg@brooks.af.mil, voice (210) 536-2812; and diane.glass@brooks.af.mil, voice (210) 536-5523.  Please ensure emails are sent to all three POCs.

<DESC>Solicitation number NA1341-03-Q-0371, dated April 15, 2003, is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted. Question:  What is meant by  'Ge Detection System? Answer:  The sentence should read, "All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following" The Germanium Detection System (GE Detection) referenced was an error.  Question:  What are the film thicknesses required for multilayer coatings?
Answer: Both layers may have similar or different thickness, somewhere between 10 nanometers to 1000 nanometers. Typically NIST will deposit a 10 nm thick Chromium layer followed by a 1000 nm thick Copper layer. Or simply 10 nm thick Aluminum layer only. Question: Is 5nM a thickness required? Answer:  This represents desirable maximum cluster size of 5 nanometers (or less), which is related to minimum thickness of the coating. NIST needs to be able to make 10 nanometers thick coatings as well as 1000 nanometers thick. NIST seeks uniformity of 2 % or better in thickness over 1 inch diameter specimen. If coating is 1000 nanometers thick, deviation in the thickness should be less than +- 10 nanometers. Question: Is 10,000 A also a requirement? Answer:  10,000 Angstroms equals 1000 nanometers and is related to typical thickness of the coating. There may be a need to deposit layers thinner or thicker than that. The due date for quotes, May 26, 2003 at 3:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, remains unchanged.

<DESC>Solicitation number NA1341-03-Q-0371 dated April 15, 2003 is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted. Question: Does NIST require a magnetron sputtering system with (3) guns? Answer: Multiple sputtering heads are specified to ensure possibility of two or three layer combination coatings such as Cr, Al, or Cr Cu.  It also adds to flexibility of coating larger specimens and small specimens when NIST can select only one head to operate.  A system with two individually selectable sputtering heads would be acceptable. Question: Sputtering guns need water cooling - what is meant by (no water cooling) electronic cooling system?  Would a chiller be acceptable? 
Answer: A system with efficient electronic cooling is preferred or a system with circulating coolant.  NIST wants to avoid cooling using tap water, it adds to the maintenance and increases possibility of water flooding in the lab. Question: Specifications indicate a need for a 4-6 week delivery after receipt of an order, which suggests that you have identified a chosen system that is acceptable; can you provide the Brand and Model Number? Answer:  NIST requires a Turbo Sputter Coater System that meets the listed requirements. NIST is not looking for a particular brand or model, just that the system quoted meets the requirements. Commercially available systems should be available within 4-6 weeks. Due to the fact NIST's current system is down, expedited delivery is required. Question: What size vacuum chamber is required? Answer:  There is a minimum specimen size of 8 inch. A bench-top sputtering system that is easy to install in a typical lab, and move from one lab to another without major space reconstruction work. The sputtering system shall be capable to reach operational conditions (vacuum, clean and gas-atmosphere) in one hour or less. Question: Is there any uniformity specifications? Answer:  NIST requirements are for a cluster size of 5 nm or smaller with a uniformity of 2 % or better in thickness over a 1-inch diameter specimen. If coating is 10,000 Angstroms thick, deviation in the thickness shall be less than +- 100 Angstroms. Question: Would a used system refurbished with a one-year warranty be acceptable? Answer:  NIST requires a new system with at least a one-year warranty, a longer warranty is preferred. The system will be used frequently and will be required to perform the highest quality of research. The due date for quotes, May 26, 2003 @ 3pm EST remains unchanged.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Services Solicitation No. RFP5-01316-GDK which was posted on April 4, 2003. You are notified that the following questions are answered: 21. QUESTION:  Section L. 13, Mission Suitability Subfactor A- p. 62: The IDIQ Areas are not to be specifically addressed other then those represented in the (4) IDIQ Representative tasks. Is to be assumed that firms are not to address an understanding of all IDIQ requirements? RESPONSE: Solicitation clause L.13, item 2 - Mission Suitability Proposal Format identifies the (4) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) representative tasks to be used in structuring the Mission Suitability Proposal as subfactors. 22.  QUESTION:  Section L.13, Mission Suitability Subfactor D- P. 64 has a page limit of 15 pages.  The page limit for this section appears very short for the Safety and Health Plan for an effort with these requirements.  Are the 15 pages to provide narrative/summary of our plan with the full-unlimited Safety and Health Plan as an attachment? RESPONSE:  Reference solicitation clause L.14, paragraph (2), Subfactor D - Safety and Health Plan is hereby amended as follows:   The offeror shall provide a company/corporate safety and health plan in accordance with NFS Clause 1852.223-73, entitled "Safety and Health Plan".  The offeror shall discuss its approach to compliance with all applicable NASA policies and procedures relative to safety, occupational health, and NASA Procedures and Guidelines (NPG) 8715.3 "NASA Safety Manual."

The plan shall be clear in its scope and specify when a more detailed, activity specific Safety and Health Plan is required. 23.  QUESTION:  Can one firm be allowed to participate on multiple teams for competing Environmental Services solicitation?  RESPONSE: One firm is allowed to participate on multiple teams for competing Environmental Services solicitation. 24. QUESTION:  Per SOW Section 1.4.1.h, Environmental Corrective Action:  "Establish and maintain…"  Is this corrective action tracking system something that has already been established, or will the contractor be required to build a system from scratch?  Subsequent language in the SOW indicates that GSFC already has plans to implement a centralized system.  Why require the contractor to develop a separate system? RESPONSE:  A centralized system is currently under development.  Expected roll out of the system is projected for some time late 2004.  Prior to roll out, corrective actions will be required to be tracked via some alternative method. 25.  QUESTION:  Per SOW Section 1.4.3.a, Hazardous Waste Collection and Management Activities:  "Provide replacement containers at the SAA".  Should the contractor assume the cost of replacement containers, or are these government furnished supplies?  If contractor assumes the cost, is the cost included in the $800,000 for this SOW item? RESPONSE:  $800,000 ($160,000 per year) is for costs incurred under SOW section 1.4.3.b, Hazardous Waste Disposal. 26. QUESTION:  In the Cost Proposal, for each of the labor categories should there be separate rates for the prime and the subcontractors or is the labor rate to be a composite to be used by both the prime and the subcontractors? RESPONSE:  There should be separate rates for the prime and the subcontractors labor categories. 27.  QUESTION:  Is information available concerning the numbers and types of vehicles that are currently being used to transport hazardous wastes (as defined in the scope of work) from the (up to) 150 Satellite Accumulation Areas (SAAs) to the hazardous waste staging facility?  Is information available concerning the number of vehicle-miles traveled by such vehicles in a typical month and/or year? Is information available concerning the average and maximum size of hazardous onmental, Health & Safety, etc.? 12. QUESTION:  Section L.15, 1. Past Performance (pp. 69-70) requests the offerer (including major subcontractors) to supply information for all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $25,000 and awarded within the last five years.  For large subcontractors this could include literally hundreds, if not thousands of contracts.  Can we interpret the request to include all Relevant contracts, rather than All Contracts. RESPONSE:  An upper limit of 20 most relevant contracts will be permitted.  Solicitation clause L.15 - Business Proposal Instructions (Competitive), paragraph 1 - Past Performance is hereby amended as follows:   "Furnish the following information for all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $25,000 and awarded to the offeror within the last five years.  Offerors with large numbers of relevant contracts may furnish the information for their 20 most relevant contracts or subcontracts." 13. QUESTION:  How much office and other space is available on-site at GSFC to house core task staff? 14. QUESTION:  Section 1.2.3 Facilities and Equipment, is there a limit to the number of staff members who can be accommodated on-site and does the government provide computers, printers, telephone service and access to the web? 15. QUESTION:  During the tour we were shown office space for two individuals. Can we assume that only two full time employees will be required on site with staff from other locations augmenting their work as needed? Or is there other office space available for additional staffing needs? RESPONSE:  Office space will be provided for each contractor Full Time Equivalent (FTE) directly supporting the four (4) core requirements (minimum of 150 sq. ft. for 1 FTE and 75 sq. ft. for each additional FTE).  The government will not provide computers or printers but will provide telephone services and access to the web. 16. QUESTION:  Section B.3: It is not clear that the $5,000,000 aggregate ordering limit referenced in this section applies to the base period alone or whether it applies to the entire potential period of performance of five years. What is the correct period of time for the $5M IDIQ ceiling? RESPONSE:  The maximum amount of supplies and services that may be ordered during the effective period of the contract is $5,000,000. The total period of performance and effective ordering period of the contract shall be five years based upon the exercise of all three one-year options. 17. QUESTION:  Will a list of the site visit attendees for both days be made available? RESPONSE:  A list of the site visit attendees for both days will not be made available.   18. QUESTION:  One of the proposal requirements for the subject solicitation is to provide technical information and costs related to Sample Task #1, SOW Section 1.5.1, concerning groundwater monitoring and modeling.  An existing ground water model is to be updated and calibrated with new data.	The existing model is described in a report entitled "Groundwater Investigation and Modeling Study of the Aquifer System, NASA Goddard Space Flight System," KCI, 2003.    Information about the model contained in this document is needed in order to understand the technical issues involved, estimate the level of effort required, and estimate the cost of executing the task.  I would like to request that this report be made available for viewing. 19. QUESTION:  Would GSFC, NASA make the report entitled " Groundwater Investigation & Modeling study of the aquifer, KCI 2003" be available for contractor's to review at the proposal library? The report would be useful to enable clear understanding and sound response to the Groundwater Monitoring and Modeling Representative task for the proposal.  RESPONSE: "Groundwater Investigation and Modeling Study of the Aquifer System, NASA Goddard Space Flight System," KCI, 2003 was added to the GSFC Library on June 5, 2003.  Offerors who wish to view this information may do so by contacting Ms. Andrea McClendon at (301)286-7975 to arrange a viewing time and date. 20. QUESTION:  Per L.17 you request 8 copies of the Business Management Proposal, but the matrix states that Group 1 receives 1 copy, Group 2 receives 2 copies, and Group 3 receives 6 copies.  Do you want 8 copies of this volume or 9? RESPONSE:  Nine (9) copies of the Business Management Proposal are required.  Solicitation clause L.17 - Proposal Copies and Volume Assembly, Business Management.  Proposal is hereby amended to reflect the requirement. The due date for responses is not extended. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Services Solicitation No. RFP5-01316-GDK which was posted on April 4, 2003. You are notified that the following questions are answered: 29. QUESTION:  The RFP states (p. 12, Section E.1) that the work to be performed will be at GSFC and another location to be determined. Please identify other potential locations, e.g., NASA headquarters (Washington, DC), Wallops Island, etc.  The "base of operations" for the work described in this RFP is GSFC, Greenbelt, MD.  GSFC conducts operations in a variety of permanent and temporary locations that may require environmental support from Greenbelt, MD. 30. QUESTION:  Can we assume that all IDIQ task activities (other than on-site data collection) are to occur off site? RESPONSE:  Refer to Attachment 1 - Statement of Work, Paragraph 1.5 - ID/IQ Services.  Incorporate the following:  Any IDIQ task order could take place within or outside the gates of Goddard Space Flight. 31. QUESTION:  The RFP is silent with respect to the quantity of labor sought for this effort. We understand that the IDIQ portion of the potential work is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate. However, an estimate of the number of hours or the number of FTE currently supporting NASA environmental program requirements would allow better estimates of future labor requirements in support of core activities. Please provide the level of labor being purchased under the current contract for core contract activities. RESPONSE:  No accurate labor history is available.  This RFP includes services covered by multiple current contracts.  The primary environmental services are currently part of a combined environmental, safety and health contract.  There is not a direct correlation between the work described in this RFP and the current environmental, safety and health services contract. 32. QUESTION:  In RFP Section L.13.3 Subfactor E "Professional Qualifications", it appears the Government is not asking for resumes, but only position descriptions.  Is this correct?  RESPONSE:  Solicitation clause L.13.3 Subfactor B is requesting Position Qualifications not resumes. 33. QUESTION:  Per SOW 1.4.1 Environmental Program Management, j. Restoration Project Oversight, are the IRP actions being overseen by GSFC or EPA, and how many sites/IRP actions are in progress? RESPONSE:  All current sites under investigation by the GSFC Greenbelt, MD, Environmental program are voluntary actions (none are overseen by the State or Environmental Protection Agency).  There are zero (0) sites/IRP actions in progress.  There are 5 sites currently under various stages of investigation. 34. QUESTION:  Is Wallops Flight Facility included in this procurement? RESPONSE:  Wallops Flight Facility is not included in this procurement. 35. QUESTION:  Section 1.4.3, RCRA and TSCA, indicates that the definition of "hazardous waste" for the purposes of the proposal includes RCRA hazardous waste, universal waste, waste oil (petroleum, oil, and lubricant waste), TSCA/PCB waste, non-regulated waste, and other special waste streams under the responsibility of the Safety and Environmental Branch.  Are there historical data as to the types and quantities of waste generated by the GSFC in each of these waste categories on a monthly and/or annual basis? RESPONSE:  The only historical data available is available in the reading room in the form of waste manifests.  Reference RCRA/TSCA: 2 Years Manifests, Certificates of Recycling or Bills of Lading - SOW Section(s) 1.4.3.a and 1.4.3.b 36. QUESTION:  The site visit coordinator indicated that the explosives bunker located in the vicinity of the hazardous waste staging facility, and explosive wastes managed in the explosives bunker, are not part of the scope of work. May we therefore assume for the purposes of the proposal that no regulated explosives are included in the above-listed waste stream categories?  RESPONSE:  Explosives meeting the regulatory definition of Ropies and Volume Assembly, Business Management.  54. QUESTION:   Section M.7. How will past performance evaluations be rated? If the numeric score is high, could past performance lower it? Also, the statement "However, offerors without a proof of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance." seems to suggest that if no past performance information is submitted, the offeror will not be penalized. What incentive is there do submit any past performance information? RESPONSE:	Past performance evaluations will be rated "Excellent, Very Good, Fair or Poor".  If a numeric score is high, past performance can or cannot lower it. Solicitation clause M.7 is hereby amended to incorporate the following statement: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS WILL RESULT IN A "NON-RESPONSIVE" PROPOSAL. . 55. QUESTION:  Since no contractual questions could be asked at the site walks and all offerors have not been issued the answers to submitted questions, could the bid opening date be extended? An extension will give NASA a more responsive and well thought out proposal and aid in the evaluation. RESPONSE:  The date for submission of proposals has been extended from June 20, 2003 to July 03, 2003. The due date for responses is not extended. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Services Solicitation No. RFP5-01316 which was posted on April 4, 2003. You are notified that the following questions are answered:  44. QUESTION: No government property user responsibilities were listed in G.10(a) of the RFP.  Is there a separate appendix?   RESPONSE:  Attachment A - Statement of Work, 1.4.1 - Environmental Program Management, subparagraph L outlines the requirements and minimum standards for maintaining Government Furnished Equipment. 45. QUESTION:  Pages 28-29 indicate we can obtain safety, environmental, etc current issues "from the CO".  How are those provided?  If you have electronic versions can you e-mail them? RESPONSE:	As outlined in Section H.5 of the solicitation, there are several NASA-wide or installation directives, procedures, handbooks and announcements that cover many of the requirements for Contractor compliance with the requirements governing the conduct of personnel and the operation of the facility.   Copies of the outlined publication can be obtained at from the Contracting Officer.  Written requests for copies should be addressed to Maria McNamee, Contracting Officer.  46. QUESTION:  Does this procurement include a medical waste incinerator? RESPONSE:  This procurement does not include a medical waste incinerator. 47. QUESTION:  Does this procurement include remediation at the rifle range? RESPONSE:  The procurement does not include remediation at the rifle range. 48. QUESTION:  Although the explosives bunker located in the vicinity of the hazardous waste staging facility is out of scope, the physical location of the facility adjacent to the loading/unloading area of the hazardous waste staging facility has the potential to affect hazardous waste loading/unloading activities being conducted in that area.  Is there information concerning the current schedule for the loading/unloading of explosives wastes from the explosives bunker, and how are such activities involving explosives currently coordinated with hazardous waste loading/unloading activities that may be occurring in the same area at the same time? RESPONSE:	In the past, check-in and checkout of explosives from Building 27B has occurred about one time each month.  Each action has taken approximately 15 minutes.  Minimal, if any, coordination issues may occur. 49. QUESTION:	What is the range of the award fee?  RESPONSE:  In accordance with Section L.14 of the solicitation, the Contractor shall propose an award fee percentage to be applied to both core and ID/IQ requirements.   50. QUESTION:  Is the work mostly going to be done by on-site personnel or you expect both on-site and off-site personnel?  The overhead rate is going to vary depending on the requirements. Please clarify.  RESPONSE:  As outlined in Attachment 1 - SOW, Section 1.2.1 - General Requirements, the Contractor must have at least one environmental professional on site and available each work day between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. unless approved by the Contracting Officer.  51. QUESTION:	Section B.10. Please explain part (a) "The use of overtime is authorized under this contract if the overtime premium cost does not exceed $0 or the overtime premium is paid for work-" Does this mean there will be no allowance for an overtime premium? RESPONSE:  The current procurement does not authorize overtime premiums. 52. QUESTION:  Section E.1. Will other locations (other than Goddard) be involved in the scope of work? If so, where are they? RESPONSE:	Refer to Attachment 1 - Statement of Work, Paragraph 1.5 - ID/IQ Services.  Incorporate the following:  Any IDIQ task order could take place within or outside the gates of Goddard Space Flight. 53. QUESTION:  Section L.17. Proposal copies Business Management Proposal requires 8 copies but the distribution requires 9 copies. How many copies should be submitted? RESPONSE:	Nine (9) copies of the Business Management Proposal are required.	Solicitation clause L.17 - Proposal CCRA hazardous waste are included in the definition of hazardous waste in Attachment 1 - Statement of Work, paragraph 1.4.3.b - Hazardous Waste Disposal. 37. QUESTION:  According to Section 1.4.3, hazardous wastes are to be picked up from the SAA within two workdays of notification.  May we assume that this pickup schedule applies to all wastes defined as "hazardous wastes" (as above) for the purposes of the proposal?  Or may different pickup schedules be applied to GSFC wastes that are not defined as RCRA-hazardous wastes? RESPONSE:  The two workday limits applies to all waste defined in Attachment 1, paragraph 1.4.3.a.  Different pickup schedule may not be applied. 38. QUESTION:	The site visit did not include inspection of hazardous waste generation locations or SAAs (Section 1.4.3 indicates that there are (up to) 150 such locations).	In the event that substandard fixed physical equipment (e.g., SAA temporary container storage cabinets) are identified in the course of contractor-implemented inspections of such areas, is the contractor responsible for procuring and installing appropriate standard replacement equipment, or is procurement and replacement of physical equipment the responsibility of GSFC?  RESPONSE:  The RFP does not include responsibility for procurement or replacement of "fixed" physical equipment located at SAAs (e.g., storage cabinets, secondary containment).  39. QUESTION:	Our site visit coordinator said that the facility is used to manage waste from the "east campus" and "west campus" of GSFC, but not to manage waste from "off site, remote areas."  Where are these "off site, remote areas" and are they in scope or out of scope?	RESPONSE:  The "off site", remote areas: are in scope.	Currently, off-site/remote areas include Areas 100, 200, 300 and 400.  Periodically, the GSFC hazardous waste management program must provide support to GSFC operations located in other locations. 40. QUESTION:  The site visit coordinator identified the existence of several vehicles that are unrelated to hazardous waste management and that are routinely parked (stored?) in the hazardous waste staging facility loading/unloading area.  May we assume for the purposes of the proposal that those vehicles could be permanently relocated from the loading/unloading area so as not to interfere with hazardous waste staging facility management and operations?  RESPONSE:	The referenced vehicles cannot be assumed to be able to be relocated.  The vehicles are located such that they do not interfere with the primary loading/unloading facilities of building 27A.  41. QUESTION:  A clarification is needed whether NASA is expecting contractor s to provide a technical description and costs of ID/IQ tasks in the Subfactor A requirements?  RESPONSE:  Reference solicitation clause L.13 - Mission Suitability Proposal Instructions (Competitive), (2) - Mission Suitability Proposal Format (page 61).  The IDIQ areas are not to be specifically addressed other than those represented in the (4) IDIQ Representative Tasks #1, #2, #3, and #4.   42. QUESTION:  What are the four (4) Core Requirements as mentioned in Section L.3.Subfactor A? RESPONSE:  Reference Attachment A - Statement of Work, Section 1.4 - Core Requirements (1.4.1 - Environment Program Management, 1.4.2 - Air Quality Management Program, 1.4.3 - RCRA and TSCA, and 1.4.4 - Water Programs. 43. QUESTION:  Is it possible to request reconsideration of the NAICS code for this solicitation? RESPONSE:  No changes will be made to the NAICS code. The due date for responses is not extended. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Services Solicitation No. RFP5-01316-GDK which was posted on April 4, 2003. You are notified that the following questions are answered: 1. QUESTION:  Is this work being performed by an 8(a) company presently?  What is the name of company if the answer is yes? RESPONSE:  The work described in RFP5-01316-GDK is not being performed by an 8(a) company presently. 2. QUESTION:  Is this a new type of work being contracted outside the Space Center? RESPONSE:  The work described in RFP5-01316-GDK is not a new type of work being contracted outside the Space Center. 3. QUESTION:  If we would want to meet with the Technical Representative on this project is that possible? RESPONSE:  It is not possible, at this time, for you to meet with the Technical Representative on this project. 4. QUESTION:  Who is the Small Business Representative at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and is it possible to set up a meeting with that person? RESPONSE:  The NASA GSFC Small Business Representative is Rosa Acevedo.	Ms. Acevado's telephone number is 301-286-8400.  The Small Business Administration Representative is Mike Kilyk.	Mr. Kilyk's phone number is 301-286-4378.  You would need to contact the Representative directly to set up a meeting.  5. QUESTION:  RFP Section L.8 (b) requires 12-point type for the proposal. Is a smaller point size (e.g., 10 point) allowed for tables and graphics, so long as it is easily readable? 6. QUESTION:  With respect to minimum type point size allowed, can a smaller point size be used in tables and graphics (but no smaller than 9 point or equivalent)? RESPONSE:	A 10 point is permitted for tables and graphics only.  Solicitation clause L.8 - Proposal Page Limitations, paragraph (b) is hereby amended as follows: (b) A page is defined as one side of a sheet, 8-1/2" X 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using no smaller than 12 point type and 10 point type for tables and graphics only.	7. QUESTION:  RFP Section L.15.1 requires past performance information for all contracts exceeding $25,000 awarded in the past 5 years. This may be a large number for major subcontractors. Could an upper limit be placed on the number of contracts, such as the 10 most relevant? 8. QUESTION:  Section L.15.1 stipulates furnishing information for all contracts and subcontracts over $25,000 and awarded to the offeror in the past five years.  This stipulation also applies to subcontractors or teaming arrangements (last paragraph Section L.15.1).  For an 8(a) contractor, this may be a reasonable number of projects.  For a larger subcontractor/team member, this requirement could be quite voluminous. Do you want to limit the number of contract descriptions provided by the subcontractors/team members to a small number of contracts that demonstrate the subcontractor's/team member's relevant qualifications?  9. QUESTION:  Section L.15, 1, Past Performance, (page 16) states "d. Brief description of contract work and comparability to the proposed effort."  Is it the intent of NASA that the proposed prime contractor and subcontractor provide information only for projects that are in some way comparable to the services listed in the solicitation?	 10. QUESTION:  Section L.15.1- Past Performance: Do we have to show all contracts for all team members for the past five years. At least one member of our team is a large, nationwide environmental services firm, with potentially more than 250 completed environmental contracts and actions. Is presentation of a smaller amount of relevant data acceptable? If so, what would you suggest as a "realistic and reasonable" number of contracts? 11. QUESTION:  Reference Page 69, Part L.15, Subpart 1.  Past Performance, 2nd paragraph, "Furnish the following information for all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $25,000 and awarded to the offeror within the last 5 years:". Is this information for "all contracts" or requirement specific, i.e., Envirwaste shipments (i.e., maximum size of vehicle needed) from the SAAs to the hazardous waste staging facility?  We assume that we as the contractor would be responsible for providing, operating, and maintaining the hazardous waste transport vehicles.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION:    The Library of Congress solicitation, RFP#S-LC03013, for Information Retrieval services for the FEDLINK Program offers customers two service options for contracting with FEDLINK vendors which are as follows:   (1) RFP section F.2.2(a)  Direct-Pay.  Under the direct pay option, customers send their agency generated purchase order directly to the vendor.  An interagency agreement between the customer and LC is not required and the customer does not pay the FEDLINK administrative fee.  The vendor provides service, invoices the customer directly against the agency purchase order, and the vendor pays the FEDLINK administrative fee.  Direct-pay processes are described in detail in section F.3 of the RFP.   (2) RFP section F.2.2(b)  Transfer-Pay.  Under the transfer pay option, a customer transfers both FEDLINK administrative fees and estimated annual service dollars to LC via a signed interagency agreement or other LC-approved customer agency document authorizing the transfer of funds to LC.  On behalf of the customer, LC/Contracts issues a delivery order to the vendor in the amount specified on the interagency agreement or funds transfer document.  After receiving the delivery order, the vendor provides service to the customer and submits the customer's invoices to FEDLINK.  FEDLINK reviews the invoices, rejects improper ones, and pays acceptable ones from the customer's account.  Transfer pay processes are described in detail in section F.4 of the RFP.   THE TRANSFER PAY OPTION IS REQUIRED under this solicitation; all vendors responding to this solicitation must offer the Transfer Pay option.  The Direct Pay option may be offered in addition to the Transfer Pay option but is not mandatory.  Vendors shall NOT offer the Direct Pay option only.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Fume Hood with Acid Workbench
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-03-856-4202

<CONTACT>Lisa Sawyer, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-3840, Fax 301-975-2541, Email lisa.sawyer@nist.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following Questions for PR#03-856-4202;

Questions & Answers - Part 2 - 
Fume Hood with Acid Workbench

1)	Question:  Construction - The specifications call for the unit to be constructed of Polypropylene interior and PVDF exterior and the Temp Bath constructed of Fire retardant Polypropylene.  The cost of PVDF is very high and I want to confirm the exterior material (polypropylene exterior would be much less expensive).  Would NIST consider a polypropylene exterior?  

Answer:  Yes, we would consider polypropylene for the exterior of the hood.


2)	Question:  Temperature Bath - do you want this to be temperature controlled or is room temperature sufficient (no heat needed)?

Answer:   temperature bath must be temperature controlled and capable of going to temperatures up to 150 degrees C.

3)	Question:  Dump Rinser - Do you have a specific vendor & model # for the unit requested?  
If so, please provide?

Answer:   NIST is not requiring a specific vendor or model number for the dump rinser.   
NIST does require the dump rinser to meet our specifications.

4)	Question:  Ability to change from Fume Hood to Laminar Flow - 
Two Options, with estimated CFM requirements 
a)	Vendor can provide an on/off switch, which will activate the motor/blower and create laminar flow.  NIST will need to have an adjustable exhaust fan (CFM) to handle the added airflow created when the laminar flow is used (fume hood with no laminar flow will require approx. 700 CFM, with laminar flow maybe 1400 CFM).
b)	The other option, Vendor can install damper system that will create laminar flow with the exhaust.  Exhaust fan CFM requirement will be approximately 1400.
	
Answer:  It would be preferable to have the vendor provide the damper system (option b) since the vendor is more familiar with the specifics of that particular hood.  NIST can provide a fan capable of exhausting 1400 CFM.




THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.

<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Contracts Group, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with the University of Washington's College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences for a research study in support Reclamation's efforts under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Habitat Program in the Columbia River Basin.  The December 2000 National Marine Fisheries Service's Biological Opinion for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) requires Reclamation to conduct a research, monitoring, and evaluation (RM&E) program to analyze the effects of habitat improvement efforts.   The University proposes to develop applications in the use of remote sensed imagery classifications that will: compare the ability of various types of remote sensed imagery to identify habitat features relevant to anadromous salmonids, and track land use and land cover change over time.  Reclamation already has a time series (1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000) of raw LANDSAT TM imagery. Under this project the University will produce a series of geospatial datalayers containing the various classified land use and land cover categories for each year in the remote sensed imagery time series; and a manuscript submitted to peer reviewed scientific journals descriptive of that resulting dataset and the procedures and protocols which were used in its creation.  The Bureau of Reclamation has a LANDSAT ETM+ scene, as well as IKONOS 1m panchromatic and 4m multispectral images. They intend to produce a final product that is a geospatial data layer(s) containing various land use and land cover categories, as well as manuscripts submitted to peer reviewed scientific journals addressing the preparation of these data, a description of the composition and configuration of the resulting land use and land cover data, and an assessment of the data application to fish habitat models. Parties who believe they have sufficient knowledge of the ESA Habitat Program and related geospatial issues sufficient to perform this study may send a research proposal demonstrating their qualifications to the address listed above (1150 N. Curtis Road, Boise, ID  Attn:  PN-3715). No phone or fax inquiries will be considered.

Sources are being sought to establish a contract to provide a quick response vehicle for a wide range of support services.  These support services include but are not limited to: independent technical studies and analysis; conduct of site surveys and field data collection; evaluation of Force Protection Battlelab and other Department of Defense initiatives; system demonstrations; tests; validation and verification activities.  Additionally the Government will require support in the area of modeling and simulation; program management; related administrative, security, documentation generation and presentation support, and program support throughout all of the demonstration or initiative phases.  Successful contractor will be required to work closely with contractors under the Force Protection Battlelab Broad Agency Announcement (BAAAIA-03-0002). The AFFPB solicits concepts based on mature technologies through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in the FEDBIZOPS.  Contractors propose concepts and ideas that are evaluated for merit and demonstrated.  After demonstration of an initiative and based on the outcome of the demonstration, the AFFPB makes recommendations to Air Force senior leaders and the Air Force acquisition community.  The recommendations help determine whether or not the Air Force should procure an item, move forward on a concept, or wait for further technology improvements.  Once a concept passes the screening and initial research, the AFFPB validates and outbriefs the concept within 18 months.  The Government envisions an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract with a basic year and four option years.  The contract will include line items priced on a firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee basis.  All interested sources are requested to provide capabilities and information about existing/developed expertise and experience.  Each Capabilities Statement shall note the company’s full name, address, CAGE Code, and size/socioeconomic status (large or small, 8(a), SDB, and whether it is in a HUBZone).  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330 ($4M).  Include any relevant contracts (commercial or government), contract numbers, dollar value, dates of performance, number and type of personnel involved, and the government program manager’s contact information.  The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought synopsis are not expected to be proposals, but rather they are expected to be short statements regarding the company’s ability to demonstrate existing/developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas above.  The Capabilities Statements are anticipated to be five (5) pages long, and are limited to five (5) pages with no prescribed format.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Air Force in tailoring requirements consistent with industry capabilities.  The Capability Statements are due by close of business on 25 Jul 03 and should be submitted to the following address:  Don Lowe, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, Bldg 954, San Antonio TX  78236, Commercial (210) 925-5055, affpbsolutions@lackland.af.mil.

<DESC>This is an amendment to sources sought FA4416, posted on 17 Jun 2003.  This market research is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.  Andrews Air Force Base is requesting information and suggestions that will be useful in soliciting a mobile communications provider that provides traditional cellular telephone service with the added capabilities of two-way radio-style functionality with both one-to one and one-to-multiple devices; 2-way text messaging, internet access and alphanumeric pager service within the device itself.  The 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB also requires the ability (via a web-based or other locally available solution) to manage its subscriber accounts, including ability to view billing status, make activation/deactivation and  rate plan changes and a capability to update via over-the-air, phone book function.  .  This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the level of service requested by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB and infrastructure (service signal coverage) requirements required from the service provider.  This SOW will provide coverage, capacity and digital wireless communications service for the 89th Communications Squadron, to include; cellular telephone; radio, text, numeric messaging and data features for its subscriber devices.  
The 89th Communications Squadron wishes to purchase certain subscriber equipment to include radios and accessories (the “Subscriber Equipment”), and to subscribe to the service, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Minutes of use per month per unit shall be pooled together among all units; the pooled minutes would include  cellular telephone call and radio minutes.  The 89th Communications Squadron account minute pool is determined by multiplying the number of units with the same rate plan by the number of minutes included in that rate plan (example: 10 user accounts with 200 minutes each equals a minute pool with 2000 minutes that all users would use).  During the Agreement Term, each subscriber unit shall be billed at one rate plan, which would be selected by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB upon activation of the unit.  Any charges in excess of the allotted number of minutes will be charged monthly to 89th Communications Squadron.  
The subscriber units will have the ability to connect directly (one-to-one) with any other subscriber unit on the fleet or to a pre-determined set of multiple user devices as configured by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB.  The 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB would have the ability to configure such calling groups and subscriber fleet structure using its locally or web-based available system configuration tool.    The subscriber units can utilize this feature throughout the defined geographical region defined as the National Capital Region, which includes the areas of Baltimore, Washington, Maryland and northern Virginia. The subscriber units will have one-way inbound, unlimited nationwide text and numeric messaging capabilities.  Any charges in excess of the allotted number of minutes will be charged monthly to 89th Communications Squadron.  
The contractor will ensure that coverage permeates at a target objective of -85 dBM signal at 95% within the following buildings:  1050, 1413, 1558, 1535, 1539, 5016, Hanger 1, Hanger 2, Hanger 3, Hanger 4, Hanger 5, Hanger 6, Hanger 7.  The contractor shall provide, at no cost to the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB, end-user training at the 89th Communications Squadron within fourteen (14) days of issuance of a delivery order/contract for the initial units, or as new features are added by modification.  End-user training will consist of proper operation of the end user equipment to include all features as described above and use of the web-based program for use to manage the account.  The contractor will provide training materials and present at one (1) day of training each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement.  Should training for any quarter not be required, the 89th Communications Squadron will provide written notification to the contractor at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled date.  
In the event it becomes necessary to install equipment on Andrews AFB, it shall be installed by the contractor and remain the property of the contractor subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.  Equipment shall be available for use by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB and be used by the contractor to provide service to the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB.  Prior to any installation, the contractor is instructed to notify 89th Communications Squadron specifically of the structures and/or equipment to be installed, as well as the proposed location of such structures and/or equipment.  Upon completion of installation the contractor shall provide a complete listing of all equipment installed to the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB.  This list shall be incorporated into and become part of the delivery order/contract via modification.  The contractor shall maintain and update this equipment as necessary on a bi-annual basis to include any new equipment installed at 89th Communications Squadron.  The listing shall include equipment installation date, value and associated installation costs.  To the extent that the contractor agrees to share its site structures and/or equipment with other companies, or allow others to “co-locate”, as that term is commonly used in the industry, on the site structures, the contractor must first seek and obtain from 89th Communications Squadron Commander an appropriate facilities license.  Training to designated 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB employees in a number mutually agreed to by the contractor and the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB (collectively the "trainers"), using the contractor's standard course, materials and methods provided to similarly situated customers, to prepare them to train the 89th Communications Squadron’s users in the use of the subscriber equipment and to provide first-echelon customer care to its users. 
The contractor will provide, at a minimum, two methods through which the 89th Communications Squadron will be able to manage their wireless assets.  Both methods will provide the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB with the following capabilities as follows: Order handsets and accessories, manage account and handset subscriber information, activate and make service changes to the handsets, review invoices and invoice details, receive status of order activities, and submit trouble tickets for support, and to create, edit or delete user group call groups.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Silos 1 and 2 Retrieval and Treatment Operations On-Site Laboratory Support - Seeking Expressions of Interest
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0001
<RESPDATE>071503
<ARCHDATE>07302003
<CONTACT>William Hensley, Procurement Manager, Phone 513-648-4478, Fax 513-648-5235, Email william_hensley@fernald.gov - William Hensley, Procurement Manager, Phone 513-648-4478, Fax 513-648-5235, Email william_hensley@fernald.gov
<DESC>Fluor Fernald, Inc. (Fluor Fernald), the prime contractor at the United States Department of Energy’s (U.S. DOE) Fernald Closure Project (FCP), is seeking on-site laboratory support for the retrieval and treatment of radioactive materials stored in Silos 1 and 2.  Silos 1 and 2 were constructed in 1951 and were used for storage of radium-bearing residues that are the solid by-products of the processing of uranium ore. These materials, known as K-65 residues, are the highest activity radioactive materials in storage at the FCP.  Silo 1 contains approximately 4,300 cubic yards of residue and Silo 2 contains approximately 3,700 cubic yards of residue. Historic analysis of the Silos 1 and 2 materials indicates that elevated levels of the radionuclides radium-226, lead-210, and thorium-230 are present in both silos.  Additionally, lead is present in the K-65 residues on the order of 10% on a lead oxide basis.

In the process to be implemented for treatment of the K-65 residues, the contents of Silos 1 and 2 will be removed by sluicing and then decanted for temporary storage as a thickened slurry in tanks in a Transfer Tank Area (TTA).  Prior to treatment (by stabilization/solidification), the Silos 1 and 2 K-65 residues will be retrieved from the TTA tanks by sluicing, transferred as a thin slurry (i.e., low solids content) to the treatment facility, and then dewatered in a clarifier to increase the solids content of the slurry.  Treatment will consist of removal from the clarifier as a thickened underflow slurry with subsequent addition of chemicals and pozzolanic materials to form a solid grout that meets various physical criteria, waste disposal criteria, and leaching criteria for RCRA metals.  The self-leveling and self-curing grout will be discharged into steel containers for transport to and disposal at an off-site disposal facility.

In the current schedule, transfer of the K-65 residues from Silos 1 and 2 to the TTA tanks will begin in June, 2004 and end in February, 2005.  Treatment operations will begin in September, 2004 and end in August, 2005 and will be conducted on twenty-four hour per day, seven day a week basis.

Fluor Fernald anticipates that dedicated on-site laboratory space and dedicated laboratory personnel will be needed to support the Silos 1 and 2 Project K-65 residue retrieval, transfer, and treatment operations.  Various geotechnical, treatability, and analytical tests will be needed to be performed in real-time, on demand, or with very short turn-around-times to meet operations needs.  Such tests could include, but not be limited to, moisture determinations, free liquids determinations, density determinations, freeze-thaw and temperature cycling tests, vibration and shaking tests, pH determinations, jar tests, formulation of grouts, metals determinations, and calibration of various on-line sensing and monitoring instruments such as gamma-ray densitometers.

Toward that end, Fluor Fernald anticipates awarding a competitively bid contract for a vendor to mobilize laboratory facilities sufficient to handle the above tests to the FCP, located about 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The laboratories shall be fully equipped, stand-alone units able to handle highly radioactive material (highest anticipated radioactivity on the order of 1,000,000 pCi/g of K-65 residue, dry weight basis).  They should have sufficient bench space, instrument space, standard fume hood space, temporary sample storage space, and HEPA fume hood space to handle the anticipated workload. Additionally, the laboratories should be adequately temperature and humidity controlled for year round operations in the Southwest Ohio climate.   The vendor also will provide experienced personnel to operate the laboratory facilities and to perform all the required tests requested by Fluor Fernald.  Fluor Fernald, will be responsible for transporting samples to the laboratory facilities and for disposing of primary and secondary wastes.  Additionally, Fluor Fernald will supply Site utilities in the form of electricity, telephone and fax lines, lavatory facilities, and potable water.  Lastly, Fluor Fernald will supply a properly prepared site location for the laboratory facilities.

With this announcement Fluor Fernald is seeking expressions of interest from vendors who 1) have experience with mobilizing/demobilizing laboratory facilities to various sites, 2) have experience performing geotechnical, stabilization/solidification treatability, and analytical tests, 3) have experience handling highly radioactive materials, 4) have experience supporting operating facilities, and 5) have experience working at U.S. DOE sites.  Interested vendors are invited to submit the following information: 1) an overview of the company, 2) a description of the facilities that are anticipated to be mobilized to the FCP, 3) a description of the company’s experience and expertise with geotechnical tests, treatability tests, and analytical tests, 4) a brief listing of projects involving highly radioactive materials, 5) a listing of the company’s experience in performing work at U.S. DOE sites, and 6) the availability of the facilities to the FCP in mid 2004 and 2005.

Vendors who respond to the competitive request for proposal (RFP) for laboratory support will be required to address all the key tasks from mobilization of the facilities, to operation and performance of tests, through demobilization of the facilities.  Additionally, the vendor will be required to operate in conformance to all FCP health and safety, radiological control, quality assurance, and other site procedures and programs. 
This announcement does not constitute a request for proposals nor does it guarantee that a request for proposals will be forthcoming.

<SUBJECT>Overhaul, upgrade and conversion of Block 0 Phalanx MK15 Close-In-Weapon System to Block 1A for Taiwan
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue a modification to contract N00024-02-C-5415 with Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337 for overhaul, upgrade and conversion of a Phalanx MK-15 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) Block 0 mount to Block 1A for the country of Taiwan. Raytheon is the only qualified domestic producer of the MK-15 CIWS which is of such a highly complex nature that substantial investment in both time and money to qualify additional sources would be required.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   General Dynamics Land Systems will be issuing a Request for Proposal (technical, management, and cost) to qualified engine suppliers or manufacturers (hereinafter  referred to as Ã¢Â€ÂœSubcontractorÃ¢Â€Â) to mature an engine design, develop key accessori es, fabricate, and test prototype hardware for the Manned Ground Vehicles (MGV) of the Future Combat Systems (FCS). The focus of this engine program shall be on engine application development, and not on base engine development.  The engine rated power sha ll be either 350 Kw or 410 kW with an assembly weight wet no greater than 450 kg.  The assembly shall include base engine assembly, Engine Control Module (ECM with associated harnesses, sensors, actuators, BIT/BITE, tactical planning, and maintenance logbo ok functions), air intake ducting from air cleaner, integral cooling system components (coolant pump(s), oil pumps), water cooled charge air cooler system including ducting and plumbing (diesel only), oil sump and scavenge system, lubricant filtration syst em, lubricant sampling system, high pressure fuel pump and fuel injection equipment, electrical connectors, exhaust manifolds (Diesel only), recuperator (turbine only), mounts, thermostats, cold start system components, turbocharger(s) as applicable. The subcontractor will complete design, development, analysis, fabrication, qualification, and delivery of two (2) engines for Propulsion Integration Lab (PIL) / Engine Generator Lab (EGL) use in June 2004, two (2) engines rated at 100% power for Automotiv e Test Rigs (ATR) in January 2005, and approximately 50 prototype engines starting in August 2005 through November 2006 at a rate of approximately 3 per month.  The PIL/EGL engines are needed to support generator and propulsion integration efforts and shal l have all electrical interfaces functional and generate a minimum of 75-80% of the rated power (100% preferred).  The engines referred to as prototypes will be in a production ready configuration.  Depending on the success of the MGV program, an additiona l 5000+ engines (production and spares) may be required over a 10-year period, with continued system technical support over a 30-year period.  Delivery of these engines for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) may start as early as 2007. Subcontract award do es not guarantee award of or participation in a follow-on production contract. The engine developed under this subcontract will be part of the hybrid electric drive propulsion system for the MGV.  The MGV includes several vehicle variants.  All variants will use a common engine located in the front of the vehicle, with exhaust for en gine combustion and propulsion cooling air exiting to the rear of the vehicle. The engine exhaust may also be used to generate water for the crew.  The engine will be designed to meet or exceed requirements for all variants.  The engineÃ¢Â€Â™s primary func tion is to drive a 600V AC generator (permanent or induction type).  It is anticipated there is no direct mechanical coupling of the engine to the vehicle drive system or suspension/sprockets or wheels nor engine driven accessories other than those directl y needed for engine operation.  The generator will be used as a primary starter for the engine and will be used to absorb excess power (back-drive) during regenerative braking.  The generator is excluded from this RFP. All requests for a copy of the Request for Proposal shall be made to Mr. Craig Rudder at the e-mail address rudderc@gdls.com no later than approximately 15 calendar days after the publication date of this announcement.

Background

The end of the 20th Century was a time of increased technological and societal change for the transportation planning community.  Innovations such as the use of GIS, GPS, remote sensing, mobile phones, internet mapping and surveying, have provided the transportation professional, industry and the general public a potential overwhelming wealth of information about personal travel, goods movement and system performance.  While rapid change in the field of transportation is not unprecedented, the increase in information and ability to analyze and display information may be.

At the same time, understanding and responding to the transportation needs has become greater and more complex.  The transportation system in the United States continues to serve an increasing population and even faster increase in vehicle travel.  More areas have become urbanized and some of the faster growing areas are in the smaller urban areas.  Both personal trips and good movements are more diverse in origin and destination, time of day and purpose.  The transportation system that will meet these increasing needs is aging.  At the same time, there is increasing consideration of other societal goals in the development of transportation programs from promoting environmental stewardship to incorporating local community context.

The role of transportation planning is changing to emphasize the movement of people and goods as well as environmental, social, economic, land development, and financial parameters of alternative futures. FHWA is being asked to assist the transportation community in addressing issues related to land development, economics, equity, congestion, and sustainability among others, within a transportation schema. This is reflected in the FHWA research agenda – crosscutting and multi-disciplinary in response to the issues facing planners today.

Within this context, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the likely forthcoming re-authorization for surface transportation and closely related legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) charge FHWA and transportation planning at all levels of government with meeting the complex demands of identifying and responding to future transportation needs. In particular, ISTEA and TEA-21 promote the assessment of multi-modal transportation needs and the analysis of the transportation, environmental, economic and social impacts of proposed investment and operational alternatives in support of decision-making. Furthermore, the breadth of ISTEA and TEA-21 energized the role of the FHWA in providing support to the transportation planning community. 

Because of this, the research universe the FHWA operates in is fluid, dynamic, and flexible. To realize its research, development and technical assistance objectives, FHWA is seeking the support and cooperation of multi-disciplined research partners to meet the challenges of transportation planning as we continue into the twenty-first century.  The ability to bring in specialists in various fields, including those outside traditional transportation disciplines, is of greater significance today than at any other time. The ability to retain flexible and responsive support, available at any time to research, assist, and answer the questions related to planning for a world class transportation system is of utmost importance. 

Purpose

The purpose of this solicitation for FHWA is three fold:

·To develop innovative approaches for providing improving transportation planning and decision-making;

·To identify and test new channels of disseminating information and expertise; and

·To develop and build on successful research partnerships

Transportation Planning Research Topic Areas

The research will be targeted at specific needs and areas of interest that will support FHWA work in Planning Capacity Building as well as innovation in transportation planning process and decision-making, transportation and land use and transportation and community impacts.

Topic Area #1: Transportation Planning in Large Cities 

Summary of Topic Area – Very large central cities (cities with around or over one million population) have unique transportation issues.  Very large cities and their infrastructure, both public and private, have high recognition in the United States and throughout the world as international gateways and destinations to people and goods that travel to the United States.  As such they play an important role in the economic and cultural health and prestige of the country.

Very large cities have high levels of congestion and delay in their transportation system as well as high levels of transportation system redundancy.  In many cases they operate and manage legacy systems that no longer reliably serve contemporary transportation needs.  The ability to plan and shape growth in very large cities is constrained by their very size, intensity of development and dramatic histories.  The cost to plan and program transportation needs in very large cities and respond to the transportation and potentially competing public policy needs are immense.  Many large cities have strong capacity, depth and resilience in both the government agencies and community-based and special interest organizations to assess and debate transportation needs.  Accordingly, their planning needs are both complex and different in scale and substance from other jurisdictions in some metropolitan areas or from State, regional and local entities in other areas.

Past studies focusing on transportation planning in very large cities have touched on themes including inter-jurisdictional coordination for traffic management, planning for pedestrians in large cities, and intermodal transportation links.

Examples of Research Projects in Topic Area #1, Transportation Planning in Large Cities:

·The research partner may conduct research looking at inter-jurisdictional coordination within the metropolitan area and between large cities and State Departments of Transportation; and
·The research partner may conduct research on integration of and consideration for diverse and emerging public policies (such as infrastructure lifecycle management, system operation, community cohesion or policies supporting context sensitive solutions/ context sensitive design) within the transportation planning process.

Examples of Product Proof of Concept/Testing and Innovative Processes:

·The FHWA research partner may test methods for promoting and supporting key policy networks for large cities in the field of transportation policy and management;
·The research partner may have facilities that can provide multimedia support for conferences, peer roundtables, workshops, education and training; and
·The research partner may test new methods for dissemination of original and other research using relevant publications and professional networks.

Specific Examples of Expertise for Success in this Area:

·The FHWA research partner should demonstrate the ability to facilitate a dialogue among the cities over one million in population and peer cities; 
·The research partner should demonstrate an understanding of complexity and variety of inter-jurisdictional relationships for large cities throughout the United States; and
·The research partner should demonstrate the ability to comprehend and summarize complex transportation issues in plain English for non-academic audiences.

Topic Area #2: Transportation Planning for Rural Areas and Small Communities

Summary of Topic Area: With constant changes in the field of transportation planning, it is increasingly important to ensure that transportation professionals and decision-makers located in the rural areas and small communities have access to tools and techniques developed for their unique needs and capacities.  There are over 2,000 non-metropolitan Counties and hundreds of regional development districts outside of metropolitan areas in the United States.  The transportation professionals and decision-makers frequently work in small and remote agencies so have less day-to-day contact with their peers to master the latest planning tools and techniques.  They may not have the time, budget or staff to attend training or workshops on innovative planning tools.  At the same time, a single transportation project in these areas may have considerable and long-lasting implications on the economic and social well being of the area.  Accordingly, it is important that the professionals and decision-makers have the best available information about transportation needs and options so they can participate in the Statewide transportation planning process.

Past research in this planning research focus area has included applying readily available data and analysis tools for understanding transportation needs, review of inter-governmental processes and identification of centers of support for rural and small community planning.

Examples of Research Projects in the Topic Area:

·The FHWA research partner may conduct research on innovative techniques for providing remote training to professionals and decision-makers on the transportation planning process; 
·The research partner may conduct research identifying illustrative examples of innovative transportation planning practice in rural areas and small communities; 
·The research partner may synthesize information on emerging and current transportation issues facing rural communities in the 21st Century;
·The research partner may conduct research on evaluating and promoting innovative and measurable methods of dissemination to rural and small community audiences on transportation planning; and
·The research partner may assess methods for strengthening the capacity of non-metropolitan local officials on issues such as growth management that balances environmental, economic, and community concerns through community-driven solutions, preservation of local identity, and safeguarding natural and cultural resources.

Examples of Product Proof of Concept/Testing and Innovative Processes:

·The FHWA research partner may pilot education and training opportunities for community, economic and rural development practitioners and policymakers;
·The research partner may test programs and publications for helping bridge the communication gap among citizens, practitioners, researchers and policymakers;
·The research partner may provide then evaluate innovative products that support and enhance the administration of county government in the United States on transportation planning;
·The research partner may conduct formal feedback and evaluation of county governments and non-metropolitan development agencies on transportation program research needs; and
·The research partner may test new concepts for operating a clearinghouse of technical assistance and information for county officials and other interested groups.


Specific Examples of Expertise for Success in this Area:

·The FHWA research partner should demonstrate knowledge of multi-modal transportation planning;
·The research partner should demonstrate ability to assess transportation needs in rural areas and in small communities;
·The research partner should demonstrate the ability to facilitate the input and involvement of rural local officials in the planning and programming process both in meetings and through electronic networks; 
·The research partner should demonstrate experience promoting peer networking and learning opportunities; 
·The research partner should demonstrate experience with public-private partnerships and innovative ways of working together on issues such as the environment, sustainable communities and balancing local context with regional or Statewide needs.

Topic Area #3: Inter-relationships between Transportation, Land Use and Markets

Summary of Topic Area: The purpose of this focus area is to investigate and evaluate the theory and practice of integrating transportation and land use policy.  The research is intended to improve the quality of debate and disseminate knowledge of critical issues in transportation and land policy by bringing together scholars, policy makers, practitioners and citizens with diverse backgrounds and experience. It is important in the exchange of insights and working toward a broader understanding of complex transportation, land use and infrastructure policies, that the research partner does not take a particular point of view, but rather serves as a catalyst to facilitate analysis and discussion of these issues to make a difference today and to help policy makers plan for tomorrow.

Example of Research Projects in the Topic Area:

·The FHWA research partner may explore, identify or document innovative examples of how decision-makers weigh transportation, land use and economics together.

Examples of Product Proof of Concept/Testing and Innovative Processes:

·The FHWA research partner may pilot executive courses where participants have the opportunity to exchange ideas with scholars and practitioners who have used or developed the latest land policy tools and techniques;
·The research partner may pilot professional development courses designed to assist the participants in developing useful skills and tools for their professional work;
·The research partner may test workshops, peer roundtables or other activity formats that provide participants with original insights and up-to-date information and unique opportunities for sharing and learning with peers and colleagues, and invaluable lessons that will assist the participants in their work; and
·The research partner may develop publications that evaluate the above training so that the results may be shared with non-participants.

Specific Examples of Expertise for Success in the Topic Area:

·The FHWA research partner should demonstrate both an academic and practitioner understanding of the policy issues surrounding transportation and land use;
·The research partner should demonstrate high ability to provide a valuable learning environment to both advanced practitioners, transportation agency executives and elected and appointed decision-makers; and
·The research partner should demonstrate peer-recognized expertise on issues such as urban and regional planning and design, land conservation, the reuse of urban land, and the behavior of land and real estate markets in relationship to transportation investments, the relationship between urban and environmental systems; the planning process and its outcomes, the interplay of public and private roles in decisions in planning and investment while being conversant in the variations and differences in authority and context for decisions in different parts of the United States.
