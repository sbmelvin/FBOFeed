<p>&nbsp;&bull; Installation of new and repairs to existing bituminous and cement concrete pavement surfaces, pads, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; Installation of new, repairs to existing and removal/demolition of existing abandoned underground utility pipelines and conduits of varied material composition, including some pipelines containing Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM).</p>

<p>Period of Performance: <br />The resultant contracts shall consist of a five (5) year contract. Contract period is anticipated to be September 4, 2017 through September 3, 2022. Individual task orders will identify the specific periods required for completion of work. Periods will be established based on the magnitude and complexity of individual task orders.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 (five (5) year contract).</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 237310. The small business size standard is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The tentative timeframe for issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) SP3300-17-R-0008 for this requirement will be on or around May 15, 2017. The solicitation will also establish the RFP due date and time. A pre-proposal Conference/Site Visit will be conducted.

<p>The solicitation will be issued as 100% Set-Aside for Small Businesses and will result in multiple awards.

The total combined contract value under this contract is estimated at $9.8 million dollars. All contract holders will have a total not-to-exceed ceiling value of $9,800,000.00 for the five (5) year period. However, the total amount of work the Government expects to issue will not exceed the ceiling amount of 9,800,000.00, inclusive of all contract holders.

Award will be based upon a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process. The solicitation will provide the evaluation factors for award. The solicitation will also identify all information that a prospective offeror must submit in order to be considered for award. Failure to submit all the information requested by the solicitation may result in the proposal being eliminated from consideration for award. Also, an offeror must be determined responsible according to the standards of FAR Subpart 9 to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>Each awarded contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of $5,000.00 during year one (1) of the contract. The minimum ordering limitation per task order will be $3,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation per task order will be $2,000,000.00. Task orders will generally range between $50,000.00 and $200,000.00.

<p>A copy of the solicitation will be available on or after May 15, 2017, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).<br /><br /><strong>Secure Documents</strong></p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below. <br /><br /><em><strong>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</strong></em></p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:<br /><br />1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ . For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br /><br />2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf .<br /><br />3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:<br /><br />a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2345.pdf .<br /><br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, at the address listed on the form.<br /><br />c) The Joint Certification Office will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.<br /><br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office.

DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br /><br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.<br /><br />4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk.

It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.<br /><br />5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.

<DESC>*** If you are viewing this announcement on a site other than the Federal Aviation Administration Contracting Opportunities (FAACO) website, please go to https://faaco.faa.gov to view this announcement in its  entirety, with all applicable attachments.

In accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1, the FAA is conducting a market survey to determine the capabilities of the market to fulfill the requirements detailed in the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  The Draft SOW has been further developed, taking into consideration feedback received in response to the initial Market Survey posted on January 12, 2017, with a closing date of February 9, 2017.  

This requirement is for Network Printers and Consumables, as detailed in the attached Draft SOW.  Deliverables under the Contract include Multifunction Devices (MFD), printer consumables, accessories, installation, and maintenance from various Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that meet the FAA IT community's requirements. Other requirements under this acquisition will be for the technical and professional support services as part of the full life-cycle management of IT assets. The Contractor must facilitate the acquisition, deployment, and maintenance of IT assets under this Contract by providing services such as asset recovery and warehousing.

The proposed procurement is intended to result in a Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) contract managed by the FAA. SAVES contracts are mandatory use contracts for the FAA's IT community under the Acquisition Management System (AMS 3.8.6) and may optionally be used by the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS) community. 

The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined at this time.   Depending on the results of this market survey, the FAA may decide to conduct an unrestricted competition or set aside the procurement for small business concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or eligible Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) 8(a) certified vendors.  

The following documents are provided as part of this market survey:
Attachment  Draft Statement of Work.
Attachment 0008  Printer Configurations and Consumables.
Attachment 0009  Market Survey Questions.

All interested vendors are instructed to review all attachments, and respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capability to meet the requirement detailed in the attached Draft SOW.  This information must be provided on the form, Attachment 0009 - Market Survey Questions.  

Industry participation, while encouraged, is strictly voluntary.  Failure to provide a response will not prevent a vendor from submitting a formal response to the FAA's release of a future SIR.  Vendor participation in any market analysis activity is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  

This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred by vendors in preparing its response to this market survey.  

This survey is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's Contract Opportunities (FAACO) web page.  It is the potential Offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.

Responses to this announcement must be submitted via electronic mail (e-mail) to Ena Morimoto, Ena.morimoto@faa.gov by 1200 hrs EDT on May 12, 2017.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only IAW FAR 5.203(a). Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for future requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.
<p>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1 the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Northrup Grumman Xetron (NG-Xetron), 460 W.

NG-Xetron is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole provider of the Scorpion and Spectre UGS, and the Government does not own the specifications nor the drawings in order to permit full and open competition.

Per FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit additional capability statements that will be considered by the agency. Any party responding to this notice shall send clear, factual documentation demonstrating their capabilities to meet this requirement. All replies must be provided to the Government no later than <strong>Saturday, May 13, 2017 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time</strong>.

<p><br />1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>1.1 The Aerophysics Test Program V (ATP V) continues and extends the efforts performed under the original ATP contract that went into effect on 19 September 1989, ATP II that went into effect on 1 March 1994, ATP III that went into effect on 13 Dec 2002 and ATP IV that went into effect in September 25, 2012. Under the ATP I, the essential capability to perform hypervelocity/aerophysics research in support of strategic, theater and tactical missile defense requirements was established. Test programs in support of Anti-Satellite (ASAT), Lethality and Target Hardening (LTH), Kill Assessment and Patriot warhead development efforts were carried out under the ATP I contract. Test programs in support of LMI, MMI, and THAAD kiH assessment for input into computational lethality codes; advanced tactical long-rod penetrators and tactical nosecones; and research in kinetic energy coupling to fluids were carried out under ATP II. This work has demonstrated the capability to perform experiments and analyses applicable to the Missile Defense Agency/ U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (MDA/USASMDC), the U.S. Army Aviation &amp; Missile Command (USA/AMCOM), the U.S. Air Force, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and private contractors. Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) testing and improvement, flight vehicle weather encounter testing (rain drop deformation/demise after transit ng bow shock), miscellaneous lower velocity launch operations and reverse ballistics test capabilities were added under ATP III. The efforts performed under ATP IV continued work supporting SMDC and customers in a variety of analyses utilizing the capabilities of the UAH equipment and resources, utilizing the hypervelocity light gas gun facilities, the measurement sensors and the experience base of the UAH range and other personnel to perform experiments and analyses for a broad class of Government specified programs. ATP IV also included the installation of a 1 to 3 terawatt, electrical pulse power system, expanding research into other high energy density physics and related fields. Similar efforts are planned for APT V.<br />1.2 The hypervelocity aerophysics research capability permits sub-scale to full-scale ground based tests. With facility upgrades implemented under ATP I - IV, scale replicas of theater missile defense interceptors can be launched over most of the expected range of intercept strike velocities, strike angles and interceptor pitch angles. These ground tests provide a relatively low cost and fast response method for obtaining experimental data for screening of systems concepts for down select decisions, for generating a broad data base for threat optical/infrared signature, lethality, kill assessment and peg points to validate computational codes. These ground tests can also significantly reduce the performance risks going into full&not; scale proof of principal flight test programs. Other facility upgrades occurring within ATP IV included the installation of a 1- 3 terawatt, electrical pulse power system, expanding research into high energy density physics, plasmas and related fields, a plasma drag gun system for micrometeoroid impact studies at or greater than orbital velocities, and a friction stir welding system in support of research in advanced metal joining technologies.<br />2.0 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES<br />The objectives of the ATP V are to perform experiments and analyses for the evaluation and assessment of sensors, plasma and related devices, control devices and algorithms, directed energy and high energy laser technologies, high energy density physics, manufacturing technologies and hypervelocity impact phenomenology including kinetic energy lethality and lethality criteria development, kill assessment, survivability and target hardening; assessment of kill enhancement devices including kinetic and chemical methods; tactical armor penetrator development and evaluation; the characterization of target observables including target radar and optical/infrared signatures; the determination of threat missile characteristics; to determine the flow environment effects on interceptor sensor performance; penetration-aids technology development and evaluation including decoys to match/mask the missile signature and/or alteration of the missile signature; development and evaluation of low observables technology; the development and evaluation of next generation propulsion and plume technology; planning, organizing, and directing extensive software development and test efforts; software verification and validation; perform software engineering analysis and studies, data analysis, archiving &amp; distributed systems research; use lethality codes, such as parametric Endo/Exoatmospheric Lethality Simulation (PEELS) code and MUVES-S2 Model for ballistic vulnerability/lethality analysis, for assessment and analysis; dynamic and structural component analysis; impact testing to support collision analysis and finite element modeling of threat and target models using LS-DYNA or other dynamic collision test models, weapon system and component evaluation, to include the impact on and from cyber effects and other operational and availability risks as they relate to the weapon system, components and their respective suppliers; engineering management support; management information system research, analysis, and evaluation; and to provide field experiment support.<br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS<br />3.1 The Contractor shall develop test plans (CDRL *002) when required by user to accomplish the tests set forth by the user organization, henceforth designated as the sponsor.

<DESC>The National Ground Intelligence Agency has a new FY17 requirement to support the U.S. Army Intelligence Community using cloud based technology services as provided on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) to enable compute, storage, processing, analysis, and sharing of intelligence information with the other members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) is critical to the intelligence infrastructure at NGIC; C2S is a private commercial cloud for the IC, based on Amazon's cloud solution called Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Director of National Intelligence directed (memorandum ES 2014-0057) all IC elements to "transition from legacy applications and systems and data housing and storage services to the IC Cloud and plan to program resources to prepare data for ingestion in accordance with IC ITE standards." This memorandum lists C2S as the mechanism for IC elements to connect to the IC Cloud. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is the executive agent for the C2S program/contract. The CIA has established the C2S IDIQ contract(2013-130131000003) to allow all IC elements to issue Task Orders in order to connect to the IC Cloud. This will be a 12 month task order against the C2S contract.

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. For the purpose of this acquisition, the NAICS code is 481219, Other Nonscheduled Air Transportation and the small business size standard is $15M.</p>

<p>Information received as a result of this RFI will be used solely for market research purposes.  The Government shall use this market research in determining the best method of procurement, which is part of the acquisition planning process. This RFI is for information purposes only and no award will result from the RFI.  This RFI shall be open from April 28, 2017 through May 12, 2017.

<CONTACT>Nedzesky, Kathleen
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order, on a sole source basis, to IMPLAN Group LLC. for the purchase of the IMPLAN State Totals Package.   This is considered a sole source to IMPLAN Group LLC. because, to the best of the NETLs knowledge and based on market research conducted, IMPLAN Group LLC. is the only known source that can provide this renewal software.  Replacing this software with another brand would have broad sweeping consequences with significant costs to NETL including, but not limited to, underlying data structures and infrastructure changes may be needed; migration of data to a new tool/structure would need to be planned and could result in a loss of service and further exploitation; users may need additional training on the new product; technical resources to support the new tool may be required; additional hardware may be needed; and that the decommission of the current product would be costly.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETLs requirement.  

This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 2:30 PM ET on May 13, 2017.  Responses must be submitted in writing to kathleen.nedzesky@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>Clause Clause Title Date<br />352.224-71 Confidential Information Dec 2015</p>
<p>Special Notice and Agreement regarding Software EULA/TOS</p>
<p>Computer software and services are often subject to license agreements, referred to as End User License Agreements (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Many of these agreements contain indemnification clauses that are inconsistent with Federal law and unenforceable, but which could create a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) if agreed to by the Government.</p>
<p>Therefore, by submitting a quotation the offeror shall agree that the inclusion of any Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and any other clauses that conflict with Federal law or regulation in any EULA or TOS are NULL AND VOID. The offeror agrees that any EULA/TOS clauses conflicting with Federal law or regulation and are not agreed to by the Government if included with the submission of a quotation. Additionally, by submission of the quotation the offeror must agree to the inclusion of FAR 52.232-39 Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations in any resulting contract or order, if awarded.</p>
<p>52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference (Feb. 1998)<br />52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (May 2015)<br />52.212-5 - Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders --<br />Commercial Items (May 2016)<br />52.217-8 - Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />52.227-14 - Rights in Data - General. (May 2014)<br />52.227-19 - Commercial Computer Software License (Dec 2007)<br />52.232-39 - Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)<br />52.232-40 - Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (Dec 2013)<br />The below Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) Clauses apply. HHSAR<br />Clauses can be viewed in full text at: http://www.hhs.gov/grants/contracts/contract-policiesregulations/<br />14.Certificate of Maintainability</p>
<p>At such time as the services of the Contractor are terminated, expire contractually or are otherwise not extended, or upon request by the Contracting Officer at any time, the Contractor shall issue, within five (5) working days, a "Certificate of Maintainability" for any or all equipment acquired and/or maintained under this contract.</p>
<p>The certificate shall state that preventive maintenance in accordance with the specifications of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has been performed and that the equipment is performing in accordance with the OEM's specifications such that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any one-time charges (including but not limited to repair or inspection charges) if such maintenance were assumed effective the day after the Contractor's performance ceases. The Contractor is responsible for bearing all costs associated with obtaining such certification at no separate charge to the Government.</p>
<p>Should the Contractor fail to issue the required Certificate of Maintainability in accordance with this clause, or should any equipment fail to perform in accordance with the certification, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any reasonable costs incurred by the Government for the purpose of bringing the equipment up to the required OEM maintenance level.</p>
<p>If equipment is acquired under this contract, without maintenance of such equipment being concurrently acquired under the contract, the Contractor shall issue a Certificate of Maintainability for such equipment at the time of delivery for each piece of equipment. The certificate shall state that the equipment is in such condition that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any charges to the Government. All charges required obtaining the requisite performance of the equipment, up to the later of the time the equipment is accepted by the Government or the warranty expires, shall be borne by the Contractor. The time the equipment is accepted by the Government is the date that the Government determines that the equipment has passed acceptance testing, not the effective date of acceptance. The fact that the equipment may have been acquired with a warranty does not relieve the Contractor of its obligations under this clause.</p>
<p>15. FDA Three-Way Invoicing Instructions<br />[To Be Provided]<br />16. Authorized Contractor<br />The Contractor shall be the software Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or an authorized reseller/servicing agent of the software OEM.<br />The Quoter shall notify the Contract Specialist / Contracting Officer immediately if this requirement is registered by a reseller with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>

<SOLNBR>NNG17GESDISCRFI
<RESPDATE>052917
<CONTACT>Ian P. Sherry , Contract Specialist , Email Ian.P.Sherry@nasa.gov
<DESC><br />THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.<br /><br /><br />
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (SD-WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU/Minority Institutions) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the Earth Science Magnetic Tape Data Recovery procurement. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small 8(a), WOSB, SD-VOSB, or HUBZone Business set-aside based on responses hereto.</p>
<p>The GES DISC project within Code 610.2 at the Goddard Space Flight Center has been tasked with recovering unique scientific data from magnetic tapes that are well past their expected media life. The recovery of this data will extend the earth science data record for many types of measurements back through the early 1960s. In many cases these tapes are fragile and the strength of the imbedded signal significantly degraded. In addition, the early drives on which these tapes were written were manually aligned and differences in alignments between drives could also make the tapes difficult to read. The data is on a variety of tape media which includes: 7-track tapes, 9-track tapes, 3480 tapes, and 8 mm tapes.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential interest in providing services for recovering the data from the media for the project. This is for information and planning purposes and to survey what capabilities are commercially available for extracting data from these media types.</p>
<p>The expected capabilities of the recovery process include at a minimum:</p>
<p>-Recover/transcribe data from tape to binary (8-bit byte) data file.</p>
<p>-Read the entire length of the media to ensure all possible data is recovered.</p>
<p>-Read the reel media at reduced speeds to reduce stress and friction.</p>
<p>-Handle media tracking issues, such as those resulting from degraded signal strength or alignment issues.</p>
<p>-Handle the problems of old media, including, but not limited to, sticky tapes and dry-rotted plastic hubs, including capability to bake the tapes to remove excess moisture.</p>
<p>-Include an inventory list showing the mapping between NASA tape number and recovered file, including digital picture of each media and labels.</p>
<p>-Provide a .csv inventory file of the individual file marks recovered from each tape to clearly identify the beginning and end of individual files on the media, number of records per file, number of bytes per record, and end of tape marker.</p>
<p>-Upon written permission from NASA after successful recovery, tapes shall be formally disposed. At a minimum, this shall include removal of all labels and rendering the media unreadable.</p>
<p>Interested vendors/potential offerors having the required specialized technical capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of five (5) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. The response should include experience and past performance in the area of magnetic tape data recovery.</p>
<p>Responses must include the following:</p>
<p>1) Business name and address.</p>
<p>2) Size of business, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees, ownership, whether they are large, or any category of small business, number of years in business, affiliate information, parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contract (if potential sub) or subcontractor (if potential prime).</p>
<p>3) Past performance information covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed) Provide a brief description of the topic/effort; the value of the action; if your company was the prime contractor or the subcontractor; and the point of contact (name of the company/Agency, customer's name, phone number, &amp; email address).</p>
<p>4) This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirements.</p>
<p>5) No solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>6) RFI responses and procurement related questions should be directed to NASA GSFC, Attn: Ian P. Sherry, Code 210.Y, 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, Email: Ian.P.Sherry@nasa.gov. Responses are requested within 30-days after issuance of the synopsis.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6 Network Contracting Office (NCO) is conducting Market Research on behalf of the Durham VAMC, through this sources sought to help determine the availability of qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Small Businesses (SB) to provide Ponemah Software System, accessories and training to upgrade the existing DSI system.

The following outlines requirement features that the medical center requires:  

PONEMAH SOFTWARE SYSTEM                1 EACH
 TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

     PONEMAH CORE SOFTWARE 6.30             1 EACH
      
     UPGRADE FROM DATAQUEST ART        1 EACH
     TO PONEMAH MX2 8 SOURCE ACQUISITION INTERFACE
     INCLUDING 2 HOURS WEB TRAINING

     BLOOD PRESSURE ANALYSIS                1 EACH
     SOFTWARE MODULE


PONEMAH SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENT           1 EACH
    AGREEMENT, 1 YEAR          
DSI s Software Enhancement Agreement provides continued software support, as well as hardware and telemetry compatibility, by ensuring you always remain on the latest Ponemah version.
This annual agreement will lower your cost of ownership by providing access to version updates and product enhancements.
Software Enhancement Agreements are available for acquisition and post analysis systems and cover the core software and all purchased options.

 *CISCO RV130 VPN ROUTER                        1 EACH                 

Router shall provide static IP addresses to all of the components in the system. These IP addresses are used to identify implants and provide technical support with identification of possible trouble areas should they need to interface with the system. The router DOES NOT indicate that the system needs to be connected to a network. It simply allows the telemetry system to act as its own closed network   allowing the software and hardware components to take advantage of modern day software coding that leverages those languages. It does allow sites that do have a desire to move large telemetry data files across the building, or the World, easy access to connect to a network and perform that task. But, the presence of the router DOES NOT indicate that the system needs to be connected to any network to work correctly.

  * NETWORK SWITCH                          1 EACH
                       
Switch is used to pull all of the hardware (E2S-1, MX2s) into a central location (hub) so that power is provided (PoE) and so that all of the data can come from the system to a CPU across one CAT wire. It is simply a power providing device and a way to cleanly gather data from multiple animals/components into one wire that is then connected to the CPU.


  *MODEL MX2 MATRIX 2.0                     5 EACH                 
 
This is a new multiplexer to replace their current Data Exchange Matrix (the older multiplexer). This is needed to move from a PCIe card based system to a network based one.

  *  POWER CORD FOR 110V POWER SUPPLY        1 EACH       


  * MODEL TA11PA-C10 PRESSURE & ACTIVITY     8 EACH
     Warranted battery life: 1.5 months,
      typical cage size: 33x33x15cm, catheter length: 5cm,
      does not include suture rib  
These are the implantable devices used for mice to wirelessly capture their activity and blood pressure.
ON-SITE ADVANCED OPERATIONAL TRAINING WITH   1 JOB
     SOFTWARE TRAINING, TWO DAY TRAINING. ALL TRAINING DAYS
     MUST BE CONTINUOUS. 

 
*Must be able to provide brand name or equal.


Delivery shall be made to VA Medical Center, 508 Fulton Street, Durham, NC  27705 within 3 weeks after receipt of the purchase order and confirmation of the order acknowledgment.
On-site training shall be scheduled with Dr. Steve Crowley and the DSI Technical Support Team and shall be completed no later than 6 months after receipt of the purchase order and confirmation of the order acknowledgment.

<DESC>Notice Number:<br />SBSS- N02RC72555-61<br /><br />Issued By:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), <br />Office of Acquisitions (OA) <br />http://www.nci.nih.gov or http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/
<p><br />Key Dates:<br />Capability Statement Due Date: May 8, 2017 by 4:30 PM EST<br /><br />This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified Small Business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 811219 with a size standard of $20,5M. <br /><br />As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>This contract will upgrade NCI's current monitoring system the latest version of equipment available and provide maintenance for one year. The new equipment will be compatible with equipment installed in 2015.</p>
<p>NIH NCI CCR Office of Research Operations requested contract is for continuation of the Rees Monitoring-Alarm System that provides support for branches and laboratories, located in the Center for Cancer Research of the National Cancer Institute. Laboratories are located in Buildings 10, 37, 41 and 50. The system currently has 580 sensors monitoring the function of selected equipment, including freezers, refrigerators, incubators, and cold rooms, which contain research material critical to programs in the Center, including several that support clinical trials. Monitoring is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities. If a sensor triggers an alarm, the system notifies preselected NIH staff by telephone, e-mail, and/or pager. The system relentlessly attempts to make contact, continually cycling through the list of scientists, until one responds by telephone or through the Internet. Using telephone, e-mail or Internet connections, scientists can monitor equipment responses to corrective actions. Moreover, the system maintains long-term records generated by the sensors, which provides historical data of equipment performance. Both real time and historical data are accessible in a secure fashion. Data are stored on a CRC server, backed up by a second server.</p>
<p>Research conducted at the National Cancer Institute generates samples that require storage at specific temperatures in various freezers, incubators and cold rooms in many locations. The temperature of this equipment is monitored by a Rees Monitoring System. If equipment were to fail, the monitoring system would alert the NCI researcher in time to recover valuable material. Maintenance and calibration of this equipment is necessary to protect the investment of the National Cancer Institute.</p>

<p>Background: <br />The HPT program is executing a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) acquisition, based on DNDO's Acquisition and Commercial Engagement Strategy (DACES). <br />The requirements for the HPT SPRDs are published in the RFP HSHQDC-14-R-00083 dated June 27, 2014 are based on DHS operational requirements and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard 42.48, "Performance Requirements for Spectroscopic Personal Radiation Detectors (SPRDs) for Homeland Security, 2008. <br />HPT SPRDs are intended to be worn by operators as standard equipment providing a passive or "tripwire" capability for constant, non-deliberate scans to increase the operator's ability to detect gamma and neutron radiation sources and identify radiological and nuclear (rad/nuc) isotopes. HPT SPRDs must be easy to use, highly reliable, capable of operating in a wide range of environments and capable of storing spectrum for communications to reach back. HPT SPRDs must also function as personal protective equipment, providing a warning to the operator of potentially harmful levels of radiation.</p>
<p>Information Sought (is only related to the "maritime variant" which includes neutron detection)</p>
<p>Please provide responses to the following questions, with the length of the response limited to five (5) pages, single spaced, Times New Roman, no smaller than 12 point font. Drawings, diagrams and/or captions to pictures are limited to no smaller than 8 point font. <br /><br />1. Did you previously participate in the HPT RFP? <br />2. If the answer is yes, do you currently have the same SPRD or do you offer a different COTS solution with gamma and neutron capability?<br />3. If your SPRD offering has changed, or has been updated, or if you did not participate in the HPT RFP HSHQDC-14-R-00083, please provide a description of the SPRD system(s) you would propose. In the description, please provide specific details on any changes to your previously proposed system (if applicable), and details on any testing (either in-house or independent) conducted to verify performance of the unit.<br />4. Are your proposed SPRD system(s) currently available on a GSA schedule? If applicable, please specify the schedule number(s).<br />5. Provide a list of government organizations currently using your COTS SPRD system. <br />6. Your HPT Business and Technical POCs.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this RFI will be answered via an amendment to the RFI and posted on FedBizOpps.org. DHS will not attribute the questions to the submitting vendor. Vendor responses to Information Sought will not be posted.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Respondents to this request must respond via email to Jennifer D'Addio, Contracting Officer, at Jennifer.Daddio@HQ.DHS.GOV, NLT 4PM ET, May 15, 2017 and include the following in their responses:</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work

Equipment being ordered: Bladder Scanner, Rolling Cart, Rechargeable Battery and Charger for the Show Low CBOC
Transaction number: 
Please provide the following information clearly and precisely. 
Description of what the equipment being requested is:   Bladder Scanner with cart, rechargeable battery and charger, and thermal paper to do bladder scanning and training within the clinic. It is going to be used as part of urinary retention program. The bladder scanner allows staff to scan the patient s bladder in clinic to determine if continued catheterization is needed. Helps to develop individualized toileting or Foley catheter placement schedules based on each patients  bladder function pattern and urinary retention at fixed times, such as every two hours, saving staff valuable time. The bladder scanner is a quick, safe and non- invasive way to measure bladder volume and post-void urinary retention. This can easily be done in the primary care clinic setting, avoiding need for specialty consultation to Urology. This equipment decreases patient wait times while identifying abnormalities. It benefits the facility by helping to improve patient care, reducing the frequency of catheterization, saving staff time, and decreases overall expense.
.
The period of performance is 30 days after receipt of award. 
Description of how the equipment being requested operates: 
Should calculate results in less than 5 minutes
Latex Free
With printer
Warranty
Scans bladder at bedside
Where will the equipment being requested be used: Show Low CBOC 

Who will be using the equipment being requested: Primary Care Providers and Nurses at CBOC.
Equipment should be delivered to
Phoenix VAHCS
650 E. Indian School Rd
Phoenix AZ 85012
Additional Information: 
Equipment can store, print and collect personal information.  BAA is required.

The C&A requirements do not apply, and therefore a Security Accreditation Package is not required per VA Handbook 6500.6 Appendix A as this acquisition does not require services that involve connection of one or more contractor-owned IT devices (such as a laptop computer or remote connection from a contractor system) to a VA internal trusted (i.e., non-public) network.

For VA Handbook 6500.6 Appendix A, number 7, the Bladder Scanner machine does have the capability to store sensitive data.  The machine can hold information on its hard drive.  The standard operation in our clinics is that no information is kept on the hard drive machine.  The information is uploaded into the system and the information is cleared from the machine immediately after upload.  
A BAA is necessary

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in May 2017.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for May* is May 1, 2017 to May 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-Reg01 and must be located within Region 1 (New England).</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: Up to 15 years.</p>

<p>NAICS-236220 Construction of Buildings<br />Department of Energy Emergency Operations Center, Y-12 National Security Complex, Oakridge, TN.<br /><br />A market survey is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of interested small business concerns to set this future project aside for them and also to solicit comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs). If your firm is interested in this project (Large Buisiness or Small Business), please respond appropriately. The proposed project is for the Construction of a new Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for the Y-12 National Security Complex, and incidental related work. Please note that this project will be in a secured location and will have stringent security requirements.</p>
<p>This facility will house the Plant Shift Superintendent's Office, the Emergency Command Center, the Technical Support Center, and the Fire Department Alarm Room. The facility will be capable of withstanding design basis events and will fully implement existing Emergency Management plans and procedures. The EOC is a single-story<br />building with approximately 11,000 square feet. Special aspects include a solar photovoltaic panel system, Chemical/Biological/Radiological (CBR) Air Filtration System, precast architectural concrete and total building commissioning. The goal will be to construct the building to achieve U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design gold certification. The major functions of the building currently exist in several locations throughout the Y-12 site; however, the new EOC will help consolidate all into one building inside the Property Protection Area of the Y-12 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Contract duration is estimated at 719 calendar days. The estimated cost range is between $10 Million and $25 Million. NAICS Code is 236220.

<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p><br />Responses should include:<br />1. Identify if your firm is a Large Business or a Small Business. If Small Business, identify and verify if your company's status is a HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and/or Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB).</p>

<p>8. The following questions are related to PLA.</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Nashville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Nashville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>9. Any other information/comments about this procurement that you would like to give for consideration.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />FOR<br />Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Snows Cut Erosion Repair, New Hanover County, N.C</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only. This is NOT a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District, is conducting research to determine the market capabilities of potential contractors to install erosion protection at three separate reaches/locations along the south and north banks of Snows Cut, part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in North Carolina (see enclosed map - Encl 1). Proposed erosion protection measures include construction of a rock revetment along the eroded slope to the mean low water level in the channel. Also enclosed is the typical cross-sectional view/design from prior construction activity in 1999 between reaches 1 and 2 on the map when the rock revetment was constructed at the vicinity of the Corps' dock facility in 1999 (Encl 2). Proposed contract work does not affect nor will replace this existing rock revetment. However, the Corps anticipates that the proposed contact work would be similar in scope and construction as the work completed in 1999.<br /><br />The estimated total length of the three areas in the proposed contract is approximately 1,300 feet. Reach 2 is approximately 300 feet long, while reach 1 and 3 are approximately 500 feet each in length. For the entire 1,300 foot length, the Corps estimates that approximately 3,000 tons of Class A rock and 7,000 tons of class B rock could be required for this contract.</p>
<p><br />The magnitude of construction for this project will be between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.</p>
<p>All interested firms with 237990 as an approved NAICs code have until 12 May 2017 at 4:00 p.m. to submit the following information:</p>
<p>- Name &amp; Address of your Firm</p>
<p>- Point of Contact (Name/Phone/E-mail)</p>
<p>- Current SAM or DUNS Number and CAGE Code</p>
<p>- Business Size, to include designation as HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Business, and Large Business. Any supporting documentation that confirms your socio-economic status should be provided, i.e., letter of certification from VA confirming SDVOSB status. The Government must be able to verify SBA certification of HubZone and 8(a) via SAM.</p>

INTRODUCTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for project number 16-102 that requires Architect and/or Engineering (A-E) Design Services to  Renovate Radiology Department, Building 70, Minneapolis VA Health Care System.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE SUBMITTED SF-330s. The contemplated A-E Services that are anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6, and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6.

DESCRIPTION:  The Minneapolis VA Health Care System requires a new master plan for renovation of the Radiology Department ; which will help prepare the Department for current and future needs.  The existing Radiology Department was originally constructed in 1987.  Since that time, patients and staff workflow has changed significantly and the technology of Radiology services and the equipment to provide these services has changed dramatically.  The Department has received multiple replacement equipment site prep projects and multiple new equipment site prep projects since original construction in 1987, but never has the entire Department needs been reviewed during these projects.  A new Siemens Somatom Definition AS 64 Scanner has been purchased and room 1Q-119 has been slated to receive this equipment.  New RF Specials equipment has been purchased for Room 12 and the room must be upgraded to install the equipment.  New general radiology equipment has been purchased and the 4 rooms slated to receive this equipment will need to be renovated.  Also, VISN 23 Biomed has several new equipment purchase in the planning phase that will require new spaces within the Department.  Reading room space is inadequate and efficiently configured to meet the Department needs.  Waiting space for the Department is not adequate for the current or projected patient load.  The overall floor plan of the entire Department has not been modified to take most of these changes into account; therefore the workflow is not conducive to patients or staff.

FINAL CONSTRUCTION:  Drawings for Bid (Sealed by A-E) including cost estimates, specifications, and calculations, shall be completed within 260 calendar days after issuance of the Award. The A-E schedule shall allow for VA review period ending with A-E receipt of VA comments for each submission no later than 15 business days after VA receives the submission.  The A-E work shall include, but is not limited to:
Site Investigations necessary to determine the existing conditions at the site of work.

Schematic plans, design development plans, and final construction drawings.

Specifications, phasing plan and cost estimates.

Design narrative and engineering calculations.

Construction period services to include submittal review, site visits and construction inspections. 

Bid Deduct Alternates of 10% of the approved construction budget shall be developed, planned, and estimated as necessary to assure award of contract within available funds. Bid Deduct Alternates shall be clearly identified on contract drawings and price breakdown shall be provided for in addition to the base offer s construction estimate. 

All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73, the total cost of the contract for A-E services must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-22 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated A-E firm selected to complete the design.

Interested firms should submit one paper copy and one CD copy of their current SF-330 to: Nebraska-Western Iowa HCS, Omaha VA Medical Center, ATTN:  Sharon Spohn (90C), 4101 Woolworth Avenue, Omaha, NE 68105-1850.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.

Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.

To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ).

Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.

Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee. Failure of a SDVOSB to be registered in SAM at the time of contract award shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contract awardee. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 

The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.

The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials.

The Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern Service Area, is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to gain understanding of the current marketplace and to identify responsible, capable sources. Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set this requirement aside for Small Businesses.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1 for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This survey will be utilized for acquisition planning, as well as to determine if there are any responsible small businesses capable of performing this project.

This Market Survey is to Establish Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) Remote Transmitter/Receiver (RTR) facility, in Gainesville FL.  All responses to this market survey will be used for planning purposes only.  

This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time. Presently, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to solicitation on a full and open competition basis or set aside all or part of the procurement.  

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received in response to this Market Survey. Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.

SECTION I:  DESCRIPTION OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED:

Project Description:  

Summary of the Work
The scope of the project is to establish a new RTR facility to the East of the GNV Air Traffic Control Towers current location. This includes the installation of a Government-furnished 12 x 28 precast shelter; a Government-furnished 12 x 12 storage shelter; and furnish and installation of four (4) 40 antenna towers. The new towers will be complete with RF heliax cables which will have a junction box mounted at the top and bottom of the towers. The towers also receive (2) 21 air terminals which are connected to a 4/0 AWG counterpoise via (2) down conductors. All work specified will be indicated on the drawings and/or specifications.
The RTR building will be powered from the transformer that feeds the ATCT, where a new disconnect and meter will be installed for the new service. Both the RTR building and the storage building will be provided with HVAC. There will be a direct buried 12 pair 19 gauge cable running from the RTR to the VOR, and there shall be a 50 pair cable running from the RTR to the ATCT. The RTR building will have control cable, counterpoise, and heliax connections.
After the contractor installs each of the antenna tower foundations, assembles and erects each tower and installs the heliax cables, the FAA will then install new cables and antennas on the top of each tower, and cables from the junction boxes into the equipment shelter to each of the equipment racks. After the connectors are installed on each cable, the cables are installed to each rack/radio and tested

The anticipated period of performance is 104 CALENDAR DAYS.

The estimated price range is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.

This market survey will serve as a market analysis to assist the FAA in determining which procurement method to use.  The failure to obtain adequate responses from responsible SBA 8(a) firms or other small businesses may result in the determination to conduct this procurement action under full and open competition.

SECTION II  CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the submission of the following information from interested vendors: 

A)   Name of company
B)   Address
C)   Phone and Fax number

b.   Provide detailed relevant performance information for projects that are similar in size, scope and complexity to this effort completed in the last five (5) years including project title, customer name, project dates, project value, customer point of contact, and description of work performed.

c.   Respondents access to additional resources, skills, subcontractors, etc, if necessary to perform the contract.  If subcontracting, teaming, or partnering arrangements are anticipated, those arrangements must be identified, as well as the estimated percentage of the total effort that each subcontractor, partner, or team member will provide of the total effort.

d.   Copies of certification letters from all responding small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) or eligible Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) that have been certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to participate in the 8(a) program, if applicable.   

All responses are to be submitted on company letterhead and limited to a total of (five) 5 typewritten pages, with font no less than 11 point.  

Information on pricing is NOT required. However, if vendor submits General information on prices/costs or a commercial/catalog price list, the FAA may use the information for planning purposes only and is NOT binding in any way.   At this time the Specifications and Drawings are not available for posting.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the Office of Facilities and Property Management, Facilities Services Division, intends to negotiate a firm, fixed price contract, on a sole source basis, with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), Washington, D.C., to purchase SmartBenefits mass transportation fare media products in support of the Federal Workforce Transportation Subsidy (FWTS) program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Included with this Notice of Intent is the&nbsp;Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>Facilities Services Division (FSD) has a requirement to maintain and manage the Federal Workforce Transportation Subsidy program, where monthly subsidies are provided to qualified participants, as mandated by Executive Order 13150. Participants can currently receive up to $255 per month, based on their commuting cost.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates awarding a firm, fixed price purchase order to WMATA for this requirement.</p>
<p>NIST cites 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) (see excerpt below) as the primary rationale for the Sole Source Determination. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) is the only contract provider of authorized fare media products for the payment to employees of NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Department of Transportation (DOT) can provide the same fare media products through an interagency agreement, but at an increased cost to NIST.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 485111, and the standard size is $15 Million.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by May 12, 2017. Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to kandy.clark@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

<DESC><p>(Reference Presolicitation Notice FA8205-15-R-0001)</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) F-22 System Program Office intends to solicit and award a contract with only one source pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract composed the following ordering periods: a five year base, a five year option, and a six month option in accordance with FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The ordering period of the will begin 1 January 2018. Periods of performance will be defined individually for each order placed during the ID/IQ ordering periods for both severable and non-severable services. Non-severable services are expected to last more than one year.</p>
<p>This contract will be a follow-on contract with Lockheed Martin for comprehensive sustainment services for the F-22 Air Vehicle. Lockheed Martin has unique knowledge and experience with the F-22 Air Vehicle as the designer, producer, and incumbent sustainment contractor and is the only responsible source to satisfy the Air Force's requirements. Any efforts to mature a new Product Support Integrator (PSI) source to basic competency and to transfer the full technical data package (TDP) would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>Locations of performance consists of five (5) operational bases: Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; Nellis Air Force Base (AFB), Nevada; Tyndall AFB, Florida; Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia; and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii; six (6) support locations: Edwards AFB, California; Palmdale, California; Hill AFB, Utah; Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and Sheppard AFB, Texas; Warner Robbins AFB, Georgia; other potential stateside and overseas locations; potential combat deployment and en route support bases; potential locations through depot partnering agreements; and the system program office.</p>
<p>For subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may submit appropriate information to Lockheed Martin's point of contact, Mr. Jeffrey Boston at jeffrey.r.boston@lmco.com.</p>
<p>The Contract Specialist for this action is Ms. Emily Pogue, AFLCMC/WWUKH, 5648 Foulois Road, Bldg. 688, Hill AFB, UT 84056, phone (801) 777-7976, e-mail: emily.pogue@us.af.mil.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this
notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be
considered for award.<BR><BR>The apparent  awardee shall acknowledge acceptance of any and all re-postings (amendments), in writing, prior to any award resulting from this solicitation.<BR><BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use
commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

</a>
<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective April 28, 2017 electronically. 

On June 23, 2016, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) published a General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) final rule to capture transactional data on procurements across all of its Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program contracts and Government-wide Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, to include Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). The Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) Rule requires vendors to electronically report the price the Federal Government paid for an item or service purchased through GSA acquisition vehicles.

As part of the strategic implementation of the rule across all GSA contracts, the agency will introduce the transactional data reporting requirement with a pilot of select products and services in the FSS program. This pilot was introduced in a phased approach beginning in August 2016.  

Schedule 73 is participating in the pilot program.  You will be required to submit all offers under Refresh 28 documentation effective December 19, 2016.

Why is the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) implementing this change? The goals of TDR are to:
- Significantly reduce burden to industry partners by eliminating Commercial Sales Practices (CSP) disclosure and Price Reductions clause (PRC) tracking requirements from Schedule contracts participating in the TDR pilot.
- Reduce contract administration burden for TDR pilot vendors once TDR is implemented. 
- Provide business intelligence to strengthen best value decision-making by ordering activities, which will allow customers to take full advantage of the wide variety and complexity of products and services offered by Schedule Partners and pass on savings to the taxpayer.
- Improve competition and increase transparency.
- Support category management and promote smarter buying.

With this refresh, the requirement for providing a CSP disclosure to accompany offer submissions will be eliminated. Other clauses and provisions are also being updated to implement TDR. This will result in significant burden reduction for our industry partners as outlined in the TDR Federal Register notice.  There is also a change to the content of the Price Proposal Spreadsheet in terms of MFC information required.  

Please note: For new offers received after the solicitation refresh under TDR pilot Schedules/SINs, the transactional data reporting clause and corresponding pricing disclosure changes will be mandatory for all awarded contracts.

For new contractors, reporting begins 30 days after the month in which the contract is awarded. 

GSA FAS published a public notice (Notice-FAS-2016-01) to solicit comments regarding the public release of transactional data reported in accordance with the GSAR Transactional Data Reporting clauses. GSA FAS will consider comments received in establishing its final position on which TDR data elements are releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). GSA looks forward to sharing publicly in what format intelligence gathered through TDR will be made available. 

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

This solicitation includes the following product/services: FSC Group 68: Chemicals and Chemical Products; FSC Group 72: Recycling Collection Containers and Waste Receptacles; FSC Group 73: Food Service Equipment, Supplies, and Services; FSC Group 79: Cleaning Equipment, Accessories, Janitorial Supplies, Cleaning Chemicals, and Sorbents; and FSC Group 85: Toiletries, Personal Care Items, Linens, and Lodging and Hospitality Supplies and Services, and Hospitality Wear. This solicitation is issued electronically only. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. 

The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 73 is a mandatory eOffer schedule, effective with Refresh 10. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-C4-030073-B (include the dashes).

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer meets or exceeds the acceptability standards for non-cost factors and whose offer is the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>BASIS for AWARD:</p>
<p>By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The ratings in the evaluation process is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 1 - Technical Response (non-cost)</strong></p>
<p>An evaluation will be conducted on each offeror's technical response and a determination will be made whether the offeror submitted all required information and whether the quote met the minimum requirements of the solicitation based on the ratings below.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings/Rating Definition <br />Acceptable (A)</strong> - The offeror provided all required information in their technical response. The quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>Unacceptable (U) - </strong>&nbsp;The quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p><br /><strong>FACTOR 2 - Past Performance Evaluation (non-cost)<br /></strong>The Government will rate past performance on an acceptable or unacceptable basis as follows: <br /><strong>Past Performance Evaluation Rating/Rating Definition<br />Acceptable (A)</strong> Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below).<br /><br /><strong>Unacceptable (U)</strong> Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 3 - PRICE PROPOSAL.</strong> The evaluation of price proposal will commence after the offeror's technical responses and past performance information have been evaluated. Those offerors deemed to be acceptable will be ranked from the lowest to the highest priced proposal.</p>
<p>Questions/clarifications regarding the solicitation shall be submitted to Dindo Laxamana, Contracting officer, dindolaxamana@fs.fed.us no later than <strong>1600 Pacific Standard Time (PST), May 8, 2017.</strong> Please ensure questions/clarifications are received before the suspense date.

<p>The due date and time specified for receipt of offers is <strong>May 15, 2017, 1600 PST.</strong> Facsimile submissions are not authorized.

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board (hereafter referred to as Governing Board) has a requirement for technical support in psychometrics, assessment development, and research on preparedness for postsecondary endeavors, pursuant to its legislatively mandated responsibilities in Public Law 107-279. <br /><br />The National Assessment Governing Board was created by Congress in 1988 and comprises 26 members appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Education, including governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators, researchers, business representatives, and members of the general public. The Governing Board sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as "The Nation's Report Card." More information on the Governing Board and its work can be found at www.nagb.gov.
<p>For over four decades, NAEP has provided information on the achievement and performance of students in the United States. NAEP, also known as "The Nation's Report Card," is the most comprehensive and only continuing, valid source of information on what U.S. students know and can do in various subject areas. Tracking student performance has permitted the nation to assess U.S. students' academic progress over time. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), within the Department of Education, has responsibility for administering NAEP. The Governing Board is responsible for setting policy for NAEP. The Governing Board's legislative responsibilities include identifying subjects to be tested in NAEP; determining the content and design for each assessment; approving all test questions; setting appropriate achievement levels; improving the form, function, and use of NAEP results; and planning and executing initial releases of NAEP Report Cards.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></span></p>
<p>The Governing Board carries out many of its legislative responsibilities through the work of three standing committees: the Assessment Development Committee (ADC), the Committee on Standards, Design and Methodology (COSDAM), and the Reporting and Dissemination (R&amp;D) Committee. The Governing Board has a requirement for technical support to facilitate some of the work of ADC and COSDAM. Committee materials and minutes from previous Board meetings can be found at: https://www.nagb.org/what-we-do/quarterly-board-meeting-materials.html. Requirements will include technical support in the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Implementation of Governing Board's Strategic Vision</strong></p>
<p>The Governing Board requires technical support for implementation of activities pursuant to the Governing Board's Strategic Vision adopted in November 2016 and will guide Board work through 2020.<br />(See https://www.nagb.org/content/nagb/assets/documents/newsroom/press-releases/2016/nagb-strategic-vision.pdf.)</p>
<p>Implementation of the Strategic Vision will require several technical activities to include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Planning and designing statistical linking studies;<br />&bull; Researching how NAEP is used by various audiences;<br />&bull; Validating the intended uses and appropriate interpretations of NAEP;<br />&bull; Developing approaches to updating assessment frameworks while maintaining trends; <br />&bull; Reconfiguring the Long-Term Trend assessments;<br />&bull; Learning best practices from other assessment programs; and<br />&bull; Exploring uses of NAEP as a measure of preparedness for postsecondary education and careers.</p>
<p><strong>Achievement Levels</strong></p>
<p>On November 17, 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released the final report of their evaluation of the NAEP achievement levels for mathematics and reading (See https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23409/evaluation-of-the-achievement-levels-for-mathematics-and-reading-on-the-national-assessment-of-educational-progress). As stated in the NAEP legislation, the Commissioner of NCES is to use the findings from the evaluation to decide whether the achievement levels should continue to be used on a "trial basis" or whether that designation can be removed. In addition, the final report included conclusions and recommendations that have implications for future Governing Board achievement levels-setting activities. Section 303, 5(6) of Public Law 107-279 specifies that the Governing Board must prepare a formal response to the evaluation.</p>
<p>The Governing Board's response to the evaluation (included in the March 2017 COSDAM materials: https://www.nagb.org/what-we-do/quarterly-board-meeting-materials/2017-march.html) refers to several follow up activities to be pursued over the next few years.</p>
<p>Technical support will be needed to assist the Governing Board with implementing some of these activities to include providing input to inform Board policy revision on setting achievement levels for NAEP; conducting research on the relationship between NAEP achievement levels and concurrent or future performance on measures external to NAEP; conducting research on how the achievement levels are used by various audiences; preparing validity arguments to support the intended uses and interpretations of the achievement levels; conducting research and producing guidance on inferences best made with achievement levels and those best made with scale scores.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Preparedness for Postsecondary Endeavors</strong></p>
<p>For more than a decade, the Governing Board has been conducting research in pursuit of NAEP serving as an indicator of academic preparedness for postsecondary endeavors. Starting with the 2013 grade 12 results, the NAEP reading and mathematics assessments have been used to estimate the percentage of students academically prepared for college. The Governing Board did undertake considerable research to explore the feasibility of using NAEP as an indicator of academic preparedness for job training, but thus far this use has not been supported (a summary of that work can be found at: https://nagb.gov/content/nagb/assets/documents/what-we-do/preparedness-research/nagb-job-training-report-102215.pdf). Additional validation research is still underway related to academic preparedness for college, and the Strategic Vision calls for re-conceptualizing preparedness for postsecondary endeavors beyond college (i.e., for the workforce). Technical support will be needed to assist the Governing Board staff with work related to NAEP as an indicator of preparedness for postsecondary endeavors.</p>
<p>The technical support will include research studies; technical memos; literature reviews and syntheses of best practices; attendance at Governing Board and other meetings; expert consultant services; and other ad hoc and quick turnaround requests.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/pre-solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-NOI-17-346 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to The Novartis Institute for Functional Genomics, Inc. located at 10675 John J Hopkins Drive. San Diego, CA 92121.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY &amp; STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95, dated January 19, 2017.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with size standard 1,000 employees.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, which indicates that only Novartis Institute for Functional Genomics, Inc is capable of providing the necessary supplies. Specifically, Novartis Institute for Functional Genomics, Inc is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the instruments requiring service and the instruments are proprietary to this company. As such, only Novartis Institute for Functional Genomics, Inc is authorized to provide service and parts for this equipment. Use of any other contractor would place equipment integrity in jeopardy which would then risk continuity of science; should the equipment not remain fully operational to original equipment manufacturer standards, standardization of longitudinal research study data would be jeopardized and any loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) mission. Accordingly, only Novartis Institute for Functional Genomics, Inc is capable of providing the required supplies.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Technical proposals will be evaluated using a summary adjectival rating in accordance with the following scale:</p>
<p>Excellent<br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p>Good<br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p>Acceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p>Marginal<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95, dated January 19, 2017.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 325998 with size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, which indicates that only Regis Technologies, Inc can fulfill the necessary requirement. Specifically, Regis Technologies, Inc is the sole source provider of the supply of 150g of each of the two intermediates for the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). For this reason and to ensure continuity of scientific research data, Regis Technologies, Inc is the only contractor capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>Cancer continues to be a life-threatening disease.  In 2016 alone, In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people died from the disease. As more is learned about the underlying molecule mechanisms that drive cancer formation, especially in diverse cancer types, novel target therapies are necessary to combat this disease.  Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) has been identified as a potential target that is essential in several cancer types.  In this regard, inhibition of LDHA is thought to be a novel mechanism to inhibit cancer growth and/or render cancer cells susceptible to additional chemotherapeutics.<br />Two lead molecules have been developed, and we have reached the stage which requires large amounts of purified final compound.  A significant hurdle in this process is the separation of regioisomers during the chemical synthesis of these compounds.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The objective of this project is to first supply 150 g of each of the two intermediates for the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).</p>

<p>Excellent<br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p>Good<br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p>Acceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p>Marginal<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>

<p><br />DOL - DOL 2012-01 - ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CLAUSE - OCI-1 EXCLUSION FROM FUTURE AGENCY CONTRACTS (DECEMBER 2012)</p>
<p>OCI-1 Exclusion from Future Agency Contracts (DECEMBER 2012)</p>
<p><br />This clause supplements the FAR provisions on organizational conflicts of interest, located at FAR subpart 9.500 and should be read in conjunction with these provisions. To the extent there is any inconsistency or confusion between the two provisions, the FAR provision controls.</p>
<p>(a) Work under this contract may create a future organizational conflict of interest (OCI) that could prohibit the Contractor from competing for, or being awarded, future Government contracts.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate situations in which organizational conflicts of interest may arise. They are not all inclusive, but will be used by the Contracting Officer as general guidance in individual contract situations:</p>
<p>(1) Unequal Access to Information. The performance of this contract may provide access to "nonpublic information," which could provide the contractor an unfair competitive advantage in later solicitations or competitions for other DOL contracts. Such an advantage could be perceived as unfair by a competing vendor who is not given similar access to the same nonpublic information that is related to the future procurement action. If you, as a contractor, in performing this contract, obtain nonpublic information that is relevant to a future procurement action, you may be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan prior to being deemed eligible to compete on the future action. Alternatively, the "nonpublic information" may be provided to all offerors.</p>
<p>(2) Biased Ground Rules. Your contract with DOL may have, in some fashion, established important "ground rules" for another DOL procurement in which you may desire to be a competitor. For example, this contract may involve you drafting the statement of work, specifications, or evaluation criteria for a future DOL procurement. The primary concern, in any such situation, is that any such firm could skew the competition, whether intentionally or not, or be perceived as having skewed the competition, in its own favor. If the requirements of this DOL contract anticipate the contractor may be placed in a position to establish important ground rules, including but not limited to those described herein, the contractor may be precluded from competing in the related action or, if possible, may be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.</p>
<p>(3) Impaired Objectivity. The performance of this contract may result in the contractor being placed in a situation where it is able, or required, to provide assessment and evaluation findings concerning itself, another business division, a subsidiary or affiliate, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship. The concern in this case is that the contractor's ability to render impartial advice to DOL could appear to be undermined by the contractor's financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed or evaluated. In these situations, a "walling off" of lines of communication between entities or divisions may be acceptable, but it also may not be sufficient to remove the perception that the objectivity of the contractor has been tainted. If the requirements of the DOL procurement indicate that a contractor may be placed in a position to provide evaluations and assessments of itself or other entities with which it has a significant financial relationship, the affected contractor should notify DOL immediately. The contractor may also be required to provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the contractor from one of the affected contracts. Such recusal might include divestiture of the work to a third party.</p>
<p>(b) In order to prevent a future OCI of any kind, the Contractor shall be subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<p><br />(1) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for, or award of, any government contracts as to which, in the course of performing another contract, the Contractor has received nonpublic and competitively relevant information before such information has been made generally available to other persons or firms.</p>
<p><br />(2) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for, or award of, any government contract for which the contractor actually assisted or participated in the development of specifications or statements of work.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for or award of, any government contract which calls for it to evaluate itself, any affiliate, or any products or services produced or performed thereby.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for, or award of, any government contract calling for the production or performance of any product or service for which the Contractor participated in the development of requirements or definitions pursuant to another contract.</p>
<p><br />(c) This clause shall not exclude the Contractor from performing work under any modification to this contract or from competing for award of any future contract for work that is the same or similar to work performed under this contract, so long as the conditions above are not present. This clause does not prohibit an incumbent from competing on a follow-on competition but the Contracting Officer may require a mitigation plan or other steps as needed to ensure that there has not been an unequal access to nonpublic competitively sensitive information.</p>
<p><br />(d) The term "contractor" as used in this clause, includes any person, firm or corporation that owns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, the contractor. The term also includes the corporate officers of the contractor.</p>
<p><br />(e) The agency may in its sole discretion, waive any provisions of this clause if deemed in the best interest of the Government. The exclusions contained in this clause shall apply for the duration of this contract and for three (3) years after completion and acceptance of all work performed hereunder, or such other period as the Contracting Officer shall direct.</p>
<p><br />(f) If any provision of this clause excludes the Contractor from competition for, or award of any contract, the Contractor shall not be permitted to serve as a subcontractor, at any tier, on such contract. This clause shall be incorporated into any subcontracts or consultant agreements awarded under this contract unless the Contracting Officer determines otherwise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors, applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which<br />the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1,<br />2017. If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees<br />with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid<br />sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their<br />own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to<br />assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill,<br />injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for<br />reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family<br />to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or<br />stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections<br />under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $1.78 per hour, or $71.02 per week, or $308.53 per month for all<br />employees on whose behalf the contractor provides health care benefits pursuant to<br />the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act. For those employees not receiving mandated<br />health care benefits mandated by the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act, the new health<br />and welfare amount will remain at $4.27 per hour.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor, 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<DESC><p>(Reference Presolicitation Notice FA8205-15-R-0001)</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) F-22 System Program Office intends to solicit and award a contract with only one source pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract composed the following ordering periods: a five year base, a five year option, and a six month option in accordance with FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The ordering period of the will begin 1 January 2018. Periods of performance will be defined individually for each order placed during the ID/IQ ordering periods for both severable and non-severable services. Non-severable services are expected to last more than one year.</p>
<p>This contract will be a follow-on contract with Lockheed Martin for comprehensive sustainment services for the F-22 Air Vehicle. Lockheed Martin has unique knowledge and experience with the F-22 Air Vehicle as the designer, producer, and incumbent sustainment contractor and is the only responsible source to satisfy the Air Force's requirements. Any efforts to mature a new Product Support Integrator (PSI) source to basic competency and to transfer the full technical data package (TDP) would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>Locations of performance consists of five (5) operational bases: Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; Nellis Air Force Base (AFB), Nevada; Tyndall AFB, Florida; Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia; and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii; six (6) support locations: Edwards AFB, California; Palmdale, California; Hill AFB, Utah; Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and Sheppard AFB, Texas; Warner Robbins AFB, Georgia; other potential stateside and overseas locations; potential combat deployment and en route support bases; potential locations through depot partnering agreements; and the system program office.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS AMENDMENT IS BEING ISSUED TO UPDATED THE ORGANIZATION ACRONYM AND CHANGE THE PRIORITY CITIES.  REVISED ATTACHMENTS A - STATEMENT OF WORK AND ATTACHMENT - POINTS AND PAYMENT SCHEDULE IS ALSO BEING UPLOADED TO REFLECT THE UPDATED ORGANIZATION ACRONYM.<br /><br />ATF intends to issue, to multiple contractors, a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) that will be available for placing orders. A BOA may be awarded to various contractors throughout the United States depending on location and ATF workload. Proposals will be accepted starting on the day this announcement is posted. All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.</p>
<p>ATF's objective is to provide a sufficient number of sources, geographically distributed, to ensure prompt and efficient performance of background investigations. ATF reserves the right to retain all proposal materials for any vendor that is denied based on geographic location only. As the needs of the Contract Background Investigation Program change, vendors who were previously denied based solely on geographic location may be reconsidered for an award.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the Federal Personnel Security Program, changes in policies, procedures and guidelines are subject to change without notice. Therefore, ATF and the Personnel Security Division (PSD) reserve the right to modify the Statement of Work (SOW) and Points and Payment Schedule at any time. All vendors currently contracted under a BOA and any new contractors thereafter, agree to adhere to any new or updated requirements, policies and/or procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation is also subject to change without prior notification. Therefore, any interested contractors should ensure they are in receipt of and submit a proposal following the current requirements and guidelines found in the most recent posting/modification/amendment. This solicitation will remain open during the established five year period; however, ATF reserves the right to amend this solicitation and include proposal submission periods to incorporate opening and closing dates.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued to state that any individual BOA that is awarded will have a period of performance for sixty (60) months from the time of award. BOAs shall be evaluated every twelve (12) months and ATF may terminate a BOA at any time without notice. At the conclusion of sixty (60) months, a contractor must re-apply through a solicitation to be evaluated and considered for issuance of a new BOA.</p>
<p>Contractors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BOA. A BOA is not a contract. A BOA, as defined by the Federal Acquisitions Regulations 16.703, as a "written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the basic ordering agreement." There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. Orders may be competed among all contractors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF Contracting Officers Representative (COR).  ATF will reimburse contractors based on the rates as outlined in the current SOW and Points and Payment Schedule.</p>
<p>Contractors are hereby informed that if offered a BOA, the contractor is responsible for filing his/her own state and Federal taxes. ATF will provide a 1099-Misc tax form to qualified contractors. The ATF is not required to provide a 1099-Misc form to any vendor who is incorporated and/or does not receive at minimum of $600 during any calendar year.<br />The following clauses are incorporated in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference). If a contractor is awarded a BOA, he/she shall complete a copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items and FAR 52.209-5, Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. The contractor shall also provide a statement proving he/she has read and understands the term and conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.</p>
<p>ATF will consider awarding a BOA to a contractor, as needed, based on past performance, qualifications and experience, the contractor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the point payment rate), and location needs. All contractors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Tier 5 background investigation (BI) and Top Secret clearance, must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the System for Award Management. These are mandatory requirements and any offeror will be eliminated that fails to comply with them. Contractors will be initially screened by location and then a review of the contractor's experience, qualifications, past performance and capabilities will be conducted. Finally, proposals will be reviewed on a pass/fail basis regarding the contractor's acceptability to mandatory terms and regulations. An interview may also be required.</p>
<p>Contractors shall demonstrate his/her experience, qualifications, past performance and capabilities. Contractors shall be rated on each response given to the below questions. The rating scale is (from low to high rating): unsatisfactory, marginal, satisfactory, very good and exceptional. Contractors that reside in a necessary location, agree to the mandatory requirements and whose proposal responses receive an overall evaluation determination of satisfactory or higher may be considered for issuance of a BOA, but are not guaranteed an award.<br /><br />A.	Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance: <br /><br />Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. Typically, though not exclusively, the contractors are retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience conducting personnel security background investigations. Contractors are required to have experience of either a college degree (bachelors) or 4 years of general experience, 4 years of specialized experience within the last 5 years or 1 year of specialized Federal background investigative experience. ATF will evaluate each contractor's experience on the basis of its breath, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BOA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting investigations in the federal environment and experience conducting personnel security investigations (including overseas experience). ATF may assess the contractor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of how well a contractor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations. ATF may contact some of the contractor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the contractor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the contractor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the contractor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the contractor was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the contractor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.<br /><br />B.	Capabilities: <br /><br />Capabilities is a method of evaluation to ensure the contractor appears to be capable of adhering to the general specifications of ATF's Contract Background Investigation Program; ability to utilize ATF owned laptop and other required equipment/programs. Capability criteria includes, but is not limited to: (1) ability to accept and complete work <br />assignments; (2) information technology proficiency; and (3) equipment requirements.<br /><br />C.	Acceptability: <br /><br />ATF will determine the acceptability of each contractor offer on a "pass" or "fail" basis. A contractor's offer is acceptable when it manifests the contractor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any). If a contractor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable. Contractors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.</p>
<p>Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF. ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.</p>
<p>All requests for a full copy of the SOW and/or Points and Payment Schedule should be submitted via email to SIAdministration@atf.gov.</p>
<p>All questions should be directed to the program office, the Personnel Security Division, by sending an email to SIAdministration@atf.gov. <br /><br />D.	Proposal Requirements<br /><br />Anyone wishing to respond to this solicitation should:<br />1.	Submit a current, professional resume; and<br />2.	Submit responses to the below listed questions.<br />Resumes shall highlight the contractor's experience and capabilities in performing background investigations. Provide examples of your qualifications and how those duties relate to the contractor's past and/or current performance. These examples will be used in evaluating the contractor's qualifications and past performance.</p>
<p>Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable, i.e., each individual contractor (person) must submit his/her own proposal. Contractors will be notified of their proposal evaluation results in writing. (No phone calls will be accepted).<br /><br />E.	Evaluation Questions:<br /><br />Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance:<br />For the following six (6) questions, respond in no more than 3-5 sentences. Failure to respond to any of the listed questions will result in an automatic failed evaluation.<br />1.	What purpose do you believe background investigations serve in today's society?<br />2.	Are you familiar with or knowledgeable of the reform efforts related to Federal personnel security programs? If so, briefly identify and describe these reform efforts.<br />3.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.34). Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Ability to meet the requirements (see attached requirements) 2. Ability to meet the delivery date 3. Price The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (1) and Factor (2), the two nonpriced factors. The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards. Offeror proposals will be evaluated under Factor (1) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the quote as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. Only those offers which meet the minimum requirements of Factor (1) will be further evaluated under Factor (2). Under this factor, the Government will rate the contractors ability to meet the delivery timeline as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. For those offers that are rated acceptable on Factor (1) and Factor (2), The Government will then rate factor (3), Price. Ability to meet the requirements and delivery time when combined are equal to price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore, contain the offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET REQUIREMENTS, Factor (1), will be assessed by evaluating commercial product brochures, drawings and technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b) (4), which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in the solicitation. Items offered, as provided in the Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be above. Ability to meet the required delivery date and shipping terms shall be demonstrated by the Offerors submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required sale and terms.<BR><BR>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Reps and Certs / FAR 52.212-3 Alt1 Offeror Reps and Certs. The offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site located at http://www.sam.gov/portal. If the Offeror has not completed the annual
representations and certifications electronically, the Offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (t) of this provision. Failure to register in ORCA may preclude an award being made to your company.<BR><BR>

Please ensure your response includes the revised, updated form, "Pt 08B(2)-Attachment 1 to 1364 Rev 05-05-16"

Q&A #4 - SFO # VA101-15-R-0082
West Haven, CT


With regard to Amendment #5 - Section 10.8.10 PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES, will the VA provide a definition for the elements comprising "Physical Security Measures"?  

Answer:  Please reference Section 10.8.10 PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES and the VA Physical Security Design Manual (PSDM).

With regard to Amendment #5 - Section 10.8.10 PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES, will the VA provide a list of those Physical Security Measures items for which prices are to be indicated in Offeror's Volume 2 - Price Proposal?

Answer:  No, VA will not issue a list of items to provide pricing.  VA is requiring Offerors to provide a list of line items for which you propose pricing related to Physical Security in proposal revisions.  The list should detail each Physical Security related item, of which the cumulative total should equal totals on Schedule D and Attachment 1 to GSA Form 1364A.  If there is a change in Physical Security related costs between initial offers and proposal revisions, Offerors should address this change narratively within Volume II - Price Proposal.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (Jun 2016), the following applies:<br /><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(a) an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, Mr. Gregory Oneal, </span>AFICA/KM OL-AMC<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email:gregory.oneal@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU/SMC ombudsman level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2395, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. </span></p>

NAS operates the primary HPC facility in support of all NASA mission areas, whereas the NCCS primarily supports the Science Mission Directorate (SMD).&nbsp; Users of both facilities are broadly distributed across most NASA Centers and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), numerous partner organizations, including other federal agencies, universities, corporations, and other organizations performing work for or with NASA. NASA/ARC and GSFC will consolidate the NAS and NCCS requirements. The consolidated requirement will be known as the NASA Advanced Computing Services (NACS).&nbsp; The consolidation of requirements will enhance best value to NASA by reducing transaction costs, ensure a streamlined acquisition, and improve the overall effectiveness of NACS services. NACS defines the scope of activities required to support advanced computing services for NASA.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to supporting the NAS at ARC and the NCCS at GSFC, the NACS may be used to provide advanced computing services to other NASA Centers and the JPL as required by the Government.&nbsp; The primary advanced computing service provided by both NAS and the NCCS is high performance computing (HPC, also known as supercomputing, high end computing, or HEC). Other areas, including high-end applications, data-intensive computing, collaborative computing, and emerging computing paradigms (such as quantum computing) are becoming increasingly important services. In addition, NACS will support NASA mission-driven science and engineering using these advanced computing services.</span></p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this
notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be
considered for award.<BR><BR>The apparent  awardee shall acknowledge acceptance of any and all re-postings (amendments), in writing, prior to any award resulting from this solicitation.<BR><BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 334419

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<POPADDRESS>Location:  The project is located on the Cleveland National Forest, Descanso Ranger District.
Description: The project areas are generally identifiable by changes in vegetation, roads, flagging, or through geographical information systems (GIS) data.  The boundaries can be adjacent units, or other natural or manmade features that clearly define the boundary as noted on the project area maps.  In most cases the interior and exterior boundaries of the project areas will be flagged with blue flagging or otherwise described below or by Contracting Officers Representative (from now on COR). If there is any discrepancy on the boundaries of individual work areas within units the COR must be contacted as soon as possible and no more work must take place until the discrepancy is resolved.

Exclusions (non-work areas):   Control areas, if present; and limitations on work performed will be noted in C.5 and delineated on the ground by a specified color flagging on the boundaries. If alternate colors are used to distinguish between control areas, colors will be known to contractor prior to commencement of work.

Accessibility: Access routes are identified above and shown on the project area maps. The project areas can and will be accessed from established highways and Forest system roads. Work vehicles and equipment will be parked on Forest Service land unless prior arrangements have been made by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC><p>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order (DO) under Basic Order Agreement (BOA) N68335-15-G-0037 to Telephonics Corporation, Farmingdale, NY, to procure the hardware for&nbsp;up to four&nbsp;complete ship sets and spare parts for one partial ship set of AN/APS143-C (V)3 radar systems.</p>
<p>Telephonics is the sole designer and manufacturer of the AN/APS-134C(V)3 RADAR and spare parts and as such is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and data necessary to provide the assets in the most cost effective and timely manner. These AN/APS143-C (V) 3 radar systems and spare parts are essential to the aircrafts in the fleet. These AN/APS143-C (V) 3 radar systems and spare parts&nbsp;will ensure that each aircraft in the fleet is equipped with the same technical components necessary to carry out the mission. These AN/APS143-C (V) 3 radar systems and spare parts&nbsp;are deemed to be available only from one responsible source when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government does not own the technical data necessary to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR COMPETITVE PROPOSALS. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation will be available for this procurement. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.</p>

Question:  If we have an existing BOA should we submit a proposal?  Response:  No
Question:  Regarding pricing, can we apply different discounts for different categories?  Response:  Yes, you can apply different discounts, or add-on, percentages by category.
Question:  If there are multiple Nursing Facilities under one parent should we submit one proposal or would you need multiple proposals?  Response:  It really depends on how the parent does business.  The important thing to remember is that each home shall be evaluated and priced individually.
Question:  I wanted to know if there is any way to follow who wins the RFP without being part of the bidding process? Response: In accordance with Section E, Instructions to Offerors in the RFP, Individual non-award notifications will not be published.

SCOPE OF WORK
1.3  Scope of Work
Provide all professional architectural and engineering (A/E) services necessary to develop complete drawings, specifications, cost estimates, project phasing site visits and construction period administration associated with renovating and modernizing the approximately 17,200 SF, old CLC East Wing of Building 1 which will house the new permanent Specialty Care Clinics, at the Central Western Massachusetts Veterans Affairs Medical Center, within the constraints of the construction budget consistent with the Veterans Affairs (VA s) project team goals as prioritized during project meetings and field surveys.  Conduct preliminary project scope meetings and site survey investigations to develop the necessary elements for conceptual layout schemes with proposed alternatives consistent with the VA s project team goals as prioritized during preliminary project meetings, field surveys and studies.

The intent of this project is to modernize the areas and include, but is not limited to:

Provide central air conditioning by using/upgrading existing chilled water systems and integrating with the energy management system
Upgraded heating systems and integrating with the energy management system
Modernize the facilities; Upgrade finishes 
Renovate space per provided space planning criteria; maximize use of existing space.
Upgrade electrical systems
Upgrade lighting systems 
Upgrade plumbing systems
Upgrade fire protection systems
Upgrade life safety systems
Asbestos and interior lead paint abatement

Correct building envelope where applicable

The existing 2nd floor east wings of Building 1 were built in the early 1920s and have had no major renovation since. The infrastructure lacks the basic essentials (no central HVAC, outdated plumbing, lighting and architectural finishes).  The area has predominately asbestos floor tile and mastic as well as interior lead paint.  Overall, this project is intended to correct many Facility Conditions Assessment (FCA) deficiencies and provide renovated space for the permanent move of the specialty care clinics.



Work will include, but not be limited to, architectural, interior finishes, mechanical (plumbing, fire protection and HVAC), electrical, structural, asbestos and lead paint abatement, and other specialty consultants required pertinent to the project requirements within the constraints of the construction budget consistent with the VA s project team goals as prioritized during project meetings and field surveys.  All finishes shall be coordinated with VA Central Western Massachusetts Interior Designer.

The A/E shall obtain all environmental and other necessary permits that would be required prior to construction commencing   including but not limited to the Massachusetts Dept. of the Environmental Protection (MassDEP)

2. DESCRIPTION OF WORK 

2.1 General:  Conduct preliminary meetings and site survey investigations to define the necessary elements of the project scope of work fulfilling the goals of the VA s project team (Engineering Svc), and presentation of preliminary layout plans with proposed alternatives to the User Group.  Based on User Group meetings and site surveys, prepare a detailed project plan description report pertinent to the project requirements within the constraints of the construction budget consistent with the VA s project team goals. Through the course of the design phase, it will be necessary to interface with Medical Center staff to ascertain the details of the scope through a series of meetings and periodic submissions of documents. All design submission requirements shall be in accordance to A/E Contract and conform to all VA criteria and standards.

The A/E shall use VA Program Guides, Design Manuals and Master Specifications in preparing the Construction Documents for the project.  However, should the A/E determine that deviation from such standards and specifications is necessary or beneficial to the Government; s/he shall promptly submit a request in writing to the Contracting Officer for permission to make the deviation.  The request shall include an explanation of the specific reasons for the desired change and benefits expected.

2.2 Implementation:  Engage the services of all consultants in each discipline deemed to be necessary to fulfill the requirements of the project plan.  Each discipline shall document and investigate the relevant existing conditions, review the building available information, and verify all essential elements pertinent to their discipline.  Site investigations shall measure, photograph, video tape, and document the conditions of areas to be renovated and/or impacted. 

The A/E shall visit the project site to investigate the information shown on the Government Furnished drawings, record (as built) drawings and other planning documents which are part of this contract.  This information is the best available, but the Government does not guarantee its accuracy or completeness.

SCOPE OF WORK BELOW

1.3  Scope of Work

Provide all professional architectural and engineering (A/E) services necessary to develop complete drawings, specifications, cost estimates, project phasing site visits and construction period administration associated with improving the exterior site on the Leeds campus in Northampton Massachusetts.  This includes repairing sidewalks, walkways, exterior concrete stairs, roadways and pavement, parking lot pavement repair, and identifying sites for approximately 200 additional parking spots.  We estimate the amount of pavement area to be repaired / replaced to be 400,000 SF. This project must be phased by priority into smaller construction chunks in order to maximize budget availability.  Conduct preliminary project scope meetings and site survey investigations to develop the necessary elements for conceptual layout schemes with proposed alternatives consistent with the VA s project team goals as prioritized during preliminary project meetings, field surveys and studies.

The intent of this project is to modernize the areas and include, but is not limited to:
  Repair / replace sidewalks and walkways so as to eliminate tripping hazards and ensure compliance with code requirements
  Repair / replace concrete pads and curbing where identified
  Repair existing concrete caps for vertical supports where identified within covered exterior tunnel walkway
  Repair / replace exterior staircases where required so as to eliminate tripping hazards and ensure compliance with code requirements
  Repair / Replace pavement in parking lots where required including restriping
  Repair / Replace pavement in areas not covered by previous work 
  Identify and design for new parking lots (or extensions of others) that would accommodate approximately 250 more parking spots
  Prepare and submit all required environmental permits for impacted areas
  Demolish buildings (ensure proper environmental requirements are met) where identified. (approximately 12 small buildings)
  Prepare Historical Documents for submission with Section 106 and Mass SHPO requirements
  Bollard improvements

The Leeds campus requires significant exterior site work including concrete, pavement, demolishing building, and adding parking in order to improve access and improve the patient experience.  There was a site improvement project in 2015 which included new pavement on about  the campus and improvements in the storm water drainage system.   However, the remainder of campus  roadways and walkways require significant repair.  There are approximately 12 buildings that the VA wishes to demolish due to inability to maintain and existing environmental hazards that exist within.  The campus has been cited on numerous occasions for slips, trips, and fall hazards which must be remedied.  It is the intention of the Facilities Management Service to have all these improvements fall under this design contract but have the A/E phase the construction work in such a way that the high priorities and most dangerous locations are remedied first so as to capitalize on the budget cycle of the VA.

Work will include, but not be limited to, civil, structural, environmental, structural, geotechnical, and asbestos and lead paint removal.  There is minor mechanical, electrical, and architectural work expected.  Include other specialty consultants such as those associated with the environmental permitting or historical submission and others pertinent to the project requirements within the constraints of the construction budget consistent with the VA s project team goals as prioritized during project meetings and field surveys.  

The A/E shall obtain all environmental and other necessary permits that would be required prior to construction commencing   including but not limited to the Massachusetts Dept. of the Environmental Protection (MassDEP) 

The A/E shall base their design to meet the following sustainable energy requirements:

  VA Sustainable Design Manual (May 2014 or later)
  Site Development Design Manual (Feb 2013 or later)
  NEPA Interim Guidance for Projects (Sept 2010 or later)

SCOPE OF WORK BELOW


SCOPE OF WORK
VA Medical Center Leeds, MA
Interior and Acoustic Upgrade Design for Acute Psychiatric Ward (Mental Health Environment Of Care), VACWM, Leeds, MA
PROJECT 631-16-030

GENERAL

The VA Central Western Mass requires design to alleviate excessive noise throughout the common areas of Ward 4 Lower, the Mental Health Acute Care Facility, for the purpose of patient comfort and staff efficiency.  Currently there are no sound absorptive surfaces either on the walls or ceilings.  The noise levels routinely rise to 75 dB which while acceptable per OSHA standards, the echo/amplification heard within the ward is counterproductive for the mental health of patients.  Additionally it interferes with staff attention and focus upon patients. Design Firm must have access to an acoustic engineer available to evaluate this project and make recommendations. 

As written in the VA Mental Health Facilities Design Guide,   Excessive noise can adversely affect a therapeutic environment by affecting both a patient and staff s ability to hear and be heard in a normal tone of voice and detracting from a calm, non-threatening environment   potentially heightening some patients  fear and anxiety levels .  

There are no known existing hazardous conditions in the ward.

PROJECT SCOPE OF WORK

This contract request is for an architect / engineering firm to design an appropriate acoustic material / mounting style to mitigate the noise while ensuring safety for patients and staff.  This ward houses acutely mentally ill patients to include patients at risk of suicide and assault on others.  Therefore any components added to the walls or ceilings must meet strict patient safety standards and guidelines.

The successful architect/engineering firm shall perform the following tasks as part of this contract:

Review available documentation of the existing systems.

Perform on-site survey to document condition of walls and ceiling and acoustic environment.  Site survey will include a walk-through of the sample panels obtained by the VA FMS and the lessons learned in terms of materials, mounting hardware, and method of mounting.

Provide a brief written report of findings and provide recommendations for the mitigation of the poor acoustic environment.  Recommend cost-effective, suicide resistant, rugged (not easily punctured, torn, pulled off, etc.) and durable options for the VA to review and approve before design work begins.  

Any components added to the walls or ceilings must be:

Durable and washable with a bleach cloth
Fire Rated 
Appearance must conjure home  like (therapeutic) environment
Limited to the common areas (no bedrooms or bathrooms are included)
Rugged (not easily punctured, torn, pulled off, etc.)

Mounting hardware and method is critical to this design.  Hanging and ligature points must be eliminated.  Tamper resistant screws must be used wherever the mounting hardware is exposed to patients.  

Panels must be able to be removed for maintenance or cleaning purposes but must require special tool / knowledge to remove them   they should be reasonably difficult for patients to remove.  

Panels themselves must be a durable material to prevent access to the acoustic material. Panels shall be bleach cleanable and finishes shall have these minimum requirements: Minimum double rub of 100,000 for fabrics, antibacterial properties, Class A & Class 1 under ASTM E84, NFPA 260, Cal 117. Cradle to Cradle and SCS certified. Metal and panels with (potentially) sharp corners should be avoided. 

Solid colors without pattern not allowed.  Due to installation within an acute psych. ward, selection of a wide variety of patterns shall be made available.  Organic, healing-type patterns preferred.  Abstract-style patterns not permitted.

Note:  100% Xorel wallcovering with x-protect barrier backing as well as digital images applied to wallcovering will also be considered. 


Design plan for the construction period should include a two week period of performance during which the ward will be shut down.  Therefore no patients will be on the ward during the time of construction.  Two weeks is the timeframe requested by the VA but design firm can recommend alternatives if there is sufficient justification.

Include in design two other elements: 

Sink is required immediately outside Nurses Station. Conduct a site survey of work practices and review of plumbing drawings to determine best location.  Sink must meet Mental Health Environment of Care standards. Must be included in the two week construction window.
The existing Nurse station was constructed with a 24 high wood base that slopes away from the desk.  It was placed there to prevent patients from grabbing staff behind the counter but has created a significant trip hazard and is not as effective in removing the risk of patient access to the Nurses Station as designed.  Include in this design an evaluation of this architectural element and design an appropriate replacement to be included in the two week construction period.  
Review door and door frames.  Many door frames seem too weak to support activity on ward.  Conduct review of possible additional support measures.
Survey existing laundry and trash carts within ward and develop enclosure that will meet the MHEOC requirements.  

Submit conceptual, design development, and final design drawings for VA review and comment by VA Engineering and Interior Design Departments.  Issue signed and stamped construction drawings and specifications for bidding purposes.

All design work shall be in strict accordance with VA Standards, including the latest edition of the Dept. of Veterans Affairs Mental Health Design Guide and VA Sustainable Design Manual. Finish/color selections shall follow VA VISN 1 standards and approved by the VA Interior Designer.

The VA Master Specifications shall be used for construction specifications.  These will be made available in electronic format from the VA Technical Information Library.

All field work shall be scheduled at least 72 hours in advance with VA Facilities Management.

Design firm shall follow applicable sections of VA PG-18-15, A/E Submission Instructions.

All new construction shall meet applicable VA life safety requirements.

All construction work will require an infection control plan.

The VA will perform a NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) review of the project.

The contract documents must instruct the installing contractor to use all reasonable means to divert construction and demolition waste from landfills and incinerators, and facilitate their salvage and recycle in accordance with VA Master Specification Section 01 74 19.

The site shall be left clean of all construction debris and hazardous materials.

Design and installation to meet latest edition of the NEC, NFPA, and all applicable building codes.

All construction work shall be performed in accordance with VA Construction Safety Code and OSHA codes.

The performance period for this work is 90 days after Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 000002 is issued to remove the wind warranty and extend the close date to May 3, 2017 at 4:00 PM CT.

1) What is the roof warranty term you will be asking for? 10 Year Minimum Warranty

2) Has any consideration been given to any areas of deficient roofing that may need to be removed, which is typically discovered during the power washing/cleaning stage of work?  Per the SOW, "The Contractor shall remove all deteriorated, blistered, or delaminated foam insulation and fill in any low spots occurring as a result of removal work to create a smooth, even surface for application of new roof coating." 

3) Can this be pre-determined by an infra-red survey? If so, who is required to do this I/R?  No thermographic survey has been conducted. There is no evidence of water permeating the existing roof. A thermographic survey is not required. 

4) Would you be open and amenable to a per square foot price for removal and replacement of wet/deficient roofing, prior to coating application?  A per square foot pricing for deficient areas discovered on the roof is acceptable. 

5) I do not see a spec sheet listing approved manufacturers of elastomeric roof coatings in the request for quotation. Normally on government projects they have a list of approved manufacturer's with specifications. Do you have an approved list of manufacturers or is it just any acrylic elastomeric coating? I ask because the quality varies depending on manufacturer and that has a direct relationship on price of the product.  Approved suggested manufactures are: GAF, The Garland Company, KM Coatings, Lexis Coatings and Conklin Roofing System. 

6) Is there a wind warranty addendum? If yes, what is the maximum mph of wind requested?  No wind warranty addendum.

7) I do not see anywhere in the solicitation where a bid bond is being requested or required.  Is this the case? Bid bond is not required. 

8) I also did not see any performance and payment bond requirements.  Will these be required? FAR Clause 52.228-15 Performance and Payment Bonds Construction has been added to the solicitation. 

9) I do not see a specific coating system requirement.  We have installed high solids, low VOC silicone coatings on numerous government facilities.  Will this product be acceptable?  Coating minimum specifications are:

a) Tensile Strength ASTM D 412, 2,000 psi minimum
b) Tear Resistance: ASTM D 624, 160 lb/in minimum
c) Elongation: ASTM D 412, 320% minimum
d) Density @ 77 Degrees F: ASTM D 2939, 9 lb minimum
e) Dried thickness: 20 mils minimum
f) Reflectivity: 85% minimum
g) Warranty: 10 year minimum

<p>Obtaining Solicitation Documents:</p>
<p>Solicitation documents (Plans and Specifications) will not be posted to the web. The government will issue one DVD to each contractor or supplier that provides the information in the paragraphs below and is determined by the government to have an authentic, legitimate interest in the project. The DVD's provided cannot be duplicated. Any duplicates will be un-usable. The authentication process identified for receipt of solicitation documents is required before access will be granted to the information on the DVD.</p>
<p>1. Offerors shall register for the project on the Federal Business Opportunities (https://www.fbo.gov/) website to be added to the planholders list (this is necessary to develop a planholders list for prime contractors, sub-contractors, and suppliers). Registration on the Planholders list does not automatically qualify the registrant to receive a DVD (See procedures below).</p>
<p>2. Prospective contractors shall submit the two forms listed below in order to receive a solicitation DVD from the Government. Email completed forms to: CENWO.WSMF@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>a. DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement: Complete a DD Form 2345 (Military Critical Technical Data Agreement) and submit it with supporting information to the address found on the form. A fillable Adobe PDF copy of this form is available at: <br />www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2345.pdf</p>
<p>Upon review and acceptance, the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program will return to the contractor an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification number and expiration date (the Program will provide this within 5-10 days of receipt - note that delays may be incurred if information required or forms are incomplete or incorrect). The contractor shall submit to the Omaha District the certified DD2345 Form containing approval signatures, certification number and expiration date.</p>
<p>b. Custodian Agreement Form for Solicitation Documents: The Custodian is an official of the company that has the authority to obligate the corporation requesting the solicitation documents. The signature of the custodian listed on the form shall be signed and sealed by a Notary Public. This form is attached to this announcement.</p>
<p>By following the procedures as identified above and once determined by the government to have an authentic, legitimate interest in the project, a DVD will be mailed to the official Custodian that provided the address and signed the letter, along with instructions on how to open and utilize that DVD. Each DVD will be marked as "DoD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information" and have an identification number assigned to it.</p>
<p>3. Request for Access Form: In order to utilize the DVD containing the solicitation, contractors will be required to obtain an ECA PKI Certification. This certificate is not required to request and receive the solicitation, but will be necessary to access the files on the DVD containing the solicitation. External Certification Authority (ECA) Program information can be obtained at:<br />http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx</p>
<p>Once your firm has acquired an ECA Certificate they will need to complete the Request for Access Form located on the DVD. The form will need to be digitally signed by the certificate holder (Custodian) and emailed to: CENWO.WSMF@usace.army.mil. Review and approval of the request form will be performed by the Government prior to granting contractor access to view the solicitation plans and specifications on the DVD.</p>
<p>4. Amendments Contractors having a DVD with access to plans and specifications will receive amendments through email from the Government to the company email address provided on the access form. Amendments will be issued as encrypted files viewable only to companies having registered digital signatures and being holders of a Government issued DVD.</p>

<DESC>Question 1:  We are confused. This RFI came out on FBO, but appears to be targeted only awardees on T4NG? Is that correct?

Answer 1:  T4NG awardees may respond as well as non T4NG awardees.  The purpose of the FBO RFI is to survey the market.

Question 2:  Is the subject effort a new requirement or a follow-on to an existing contract? If the latter, can I please find out the incumbent contractor's name and contract number?

Answer 2:  This effort is a recompete.  The previous task order was VA118-16-D-1001 VA11816F10010002 Business Information Technology Solutions, Inc

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VHA245-17-AP-3075

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 05,  688  Medical Center
                                         50 Irving St. North West Washing ton D.C 20422

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Requesting sole source procurement to upgrade the facilities LOCK OUT TAG OUT program which supports the Medical Center buildings infrastructure, employee s patients and visitors. This is a facility wide that is critical to the life safety of the facilities employees, patients and visitors therefore these services are needed in order to update this system. The facility presently has a policy and standard operating procedures (SOP S) that are outdated and has been cited by our Hospital leadership for upgrades. We have several new systems that have been added as well as older systems that have to be deleted from the files therefore an urgent and compelling need exist to revise and update this program as per OSHA standards. LOCK OUT TAG OUT programs are extremely critical to a health care facility and Life safety and wellbeing of patient s employees and visitors as well an OSHA and Joint Commission requirement.
Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:   
Many serious workplace injuries, amputations, and fatalities result from the uncontrolled release of hazardous energy.  To curb these accidents, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the Control of Hazardous Energy Standard on September 1, 1989 (29 CFR 1910.147, also known as Lockout/tagout).  This standard establishes safety requirements for the control of hazardous energy sources during servicing and/or maintenance. This program refers to machine-specific, step-by-step procedures that must be used for the safe deactivation, lockout, tagout, and testing of facility equipment prior to performing any servicing and/or maintenance.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
 (  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 ( XX )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority 
It is has been determined that a sole source award may be made to Brady Corporation . This contractor has provided services to VISN 5 Health Care Facilities in prior years and is able to support this urgent request in a timely manner.  The contracting officer has validated that the contractor is listed in Vendor Information Pages (VIP) data base and qualifies as  Approved Vendor  in accordance with GSA and Federal Supply Schedule for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement.  Brady Corporation is the preferred company with technical expertise to preform  surveys and updates and  installations in this facility.
  Unusual and Compelling Urgency: The facility has several findings documented by VISN 05 Annual Work place evaluation team during the annual visit in 2016 that the Lock out tag out program for this facility has expired. The recommendation by the VISN Safety Engineers is that the program has to be audited/updated to include the new equipment added since 2010 as well as training for the employee s that come in contact, operate and maintain. This is also documented  the Joint Commission standards that requires medical center life safety and utility systems to be maintained/updated as needed at all times. Any fault or spillage of energy and or lack of proper equipment would be a life safety risk for all patients visitors and employees. Delaying awarding this contract could result in serious injury or worse. The medical center would have to stop receiving patients and may have to start emergency procedures to move patients to non-VA facilities which would cost $500k in weekly charges. The contractor has performed prior services and supplied safety services/devices to the VAMC and has been working with FMS staff on other issues. The vendor is already mobilized and has a clear understanding of the requirements needed to provide the services on demand. (See attached document concerning findings for Lock Out Tag Out).
.
Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
Due to the urgent and compelling nature of the Joint Commission standards that requires medical center life safety and utility systems to be maintained at all time. Any fault or spillage of energy and or lack of proper equipment would put patients at risk while attempting to complete the service in an open market competition.
