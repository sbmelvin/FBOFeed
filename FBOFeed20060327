<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Volcano Hazards Team (VHT) in Vancouver, WA intends to make a sole source award to Nanometrics Inc, 250 Herzberg Road, Kanata Ontario Canada, for a COMMERCIAL Item.  The USGS Volcano Hazards Program (VHP) and its components, which include the VHT and Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), installs and operates geophysical monitoring stations at volcanoes throughout the world.  Recent eruptions in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), a U.S. Territory with 9 active volcanoes, have demonstrated the requirement for volcano monitoring to address potential threats to people living on the volcanic islands as well as to domestic, international and U.S. military aviation interests.  The equipment being purchased by the VHT is compatible with that being used by the AVO and will allow for a common pool of spare parts to maximize the interoperability of VHT and AVO personnel who must install and maintain these complex systems in remote environments, and to implement the CNMI monitoring system in a manner consistent with the volcano and tsunami monitoring systems already in operation.  Satellite coverage in the CNMI is sparse, and is limited to C-band transmission and reception.  Nanometrics has recognized expertise in operating real-time telemetered seismic networks in the western Pacific region with satellite C-band telemetry.  Further Nanometrics is the only company known to be providing a turn-key, fully integrated system optimized for transmission of seismic data, and providing for a dedicated private circuit that would work in this remote region.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  Simplified Acquisition for commercial items procedures will be used.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond within 10 days of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9339 or email vfriesner@usgs.gov.  A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY FUNDS.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR CURRENT CONTRACT DG1321-02-CQ-0002: CHANGE IN SCOPE


The Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Computer Systems & Services Division requires continued contractor services to provide support for the long-term econometric and statistical processing to support the Benchmark Input –Output and Annual Input-Output processing systems. This support provides data and publication dissemination (VIA the web and other media) of critical economic data, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and other National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). This is a notice for a change in scope of the current contract DG1321-02-CQ-0002.

The current contract is held by Metzger Consulting Inc, of Bethesda, Maryland.  Metzger Consulting Inc has conducted all support activities for this project since 2002.  Currently, the Period of Performance of this contract is set to end on 14 May 2007.

The support of Annual Input-Output accounts (AIO) prepared every year and the Benchmark I-O accounts (BMIO)  prepared every 5 years in which an economic census has been done.  This request for a sole source to increase capacity in the amount of $500,000.00.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides a clear picture of the U.S. economy through the preparation, development and interpretation of the national income and products accounts, which show the business and other components of national wealth; the input-output accounts; personal income and related economic series by geographic area; the U.S. Balance of payments accounts and associated foreign investing accounts; and measures relating to environmental change within the framework of the national economic accounts. 

This acquisition will be re-competed exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about April 20, 2006. However, the statistical processing systems support for the Benchmark Input–Output (BMIO) and Annual Input-Output (AIO) processing systems that requires consistency in methodology within BMIO and AIO for the calendar year reported.  

Due to the lag time between the quarterly econometric and statistical data computations and the support of Benchmarking Input –Output and Annual Input-Output processing systems, this end date will allow the contractor time to Benchmark these systems all of the 2006 data dissemination and publication (Via the web and other media) completing technical documentation. Extension of these services will provide a clear picture of the U.S. economy through the preparation, development and interpretation of the national income and products accounts during the contractor transition following award of the new contract.

<DESC>There is no soliciation.  This is a single source action.  If you have any questions email Kathy_Haluschak@fws.gov. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service IDIQ I. Introduction The Great Basin Institute (GBI), established in 1998, is an interdisciplinary field studies organization that promotes environmental research, education, and conservation throughout the inner-mountain west. The Institute advances ecological literacy and land conservation through educational outreach and direct service programs.  GBI is able to meet its mission through a number of environmental service outlets including restoration crews, research associateships, the Basin and Range Forestry program, as well as a six-week international volunteer program. II. Nevada Conservation Corps (NCC) Restoration Crews NCC programs engage young people, generally 17-24, in productive services that benefit students, educators, park personnel and the general public. Drawing corps members from diverse ethnic and geographic backgrounds in secondary and higher education institutions the NCC provides a comprehensive environmental field studies and service program that advances ecological literacy, conservation, and environmental research throughout the Great Basin. NCC Restoration crews provide three main types of service: public lands restoration, forestry, and trail work: Restoration: In the past year alone restoration activities have consisted of restoring desert tortoise habitat, eradicating invasive plants (e.g.: Athel and Sahara Mustard), obliterating illegal wilderness roads, and planting and reseeding thousands of native species to mitigate fire and anthropogenic disturbances. Forestry: NCC forestry crews provide statewide assistance in forest fuels reduction (e.g.: Mountain Mahogany) and restoration.  Crew members are trained by GBI to safely and effectively use chain saws.  Past projects have included thinning conifers to restore critical aspen habitat, thinning timber stands along the wildland-urban interface to reduce fire danger and protect homes, tamarisk removal in southern Nevada that combines chainsaw work with herbicide application to mitigate the effects of this wide-spread exotic species. Trails: Construction of new recreational trails and maintenance of existing recreational trails is a major component of the Nevada Conservation Corps summer and fall program. NCC crews are supervised by experienced and proven trail builders, who are able to share their knowledge with volunteers from our program to produce high quality recreational trails.  NCC crews maintain existing recreational trails and improve upon their quality by upgrading erosion control structures, clearing trail corridors, repairing tread, and rebuilding rock structures. The cost for one 10-person, 8-day NCC crew varies depending on the scope of the project.  In general, an NCC crew consists of one crew supervisor, one crew leader, and eight crew members.  NCC often provides the necessary hand tools, transportation to and from the work site, and is fully prepared for overnight camping.  A sample budget is as follows: 1 crew supervisor @ $19.69/hr x 80 hrs = $ 1,575.20 1 crew leader        @ $17.75/hr x 80 hrs = $ 1,420.00 8 crew members   @ $13.60/hr x 80 hrs = $ 8,704.00 Transportation      @ $.48/mi x 1000 mi = $    480.00 Total					    = $12,179.20 III. Research Associateships: The research associate program provides professional experience for individuals who wish to enrich and apply their field-based conservation experience in an array of settings that encourage application and development of project management and administration skills.  Our research associate program provides substantial educational scholarships, training, and educational opportunities.  Research associates perform a vast array of tasks, both in a field and office setting, including field research, data collection and analysis, project development and management, personnel management, field restoration, and GIS analysis among others. Through a grant with AmeriCorps and the National Association of Service and Conservation Corps (NASCC) GBI is often able to offer AmeriCorps education awards valued at $2.77 per hour.  Because GBI is a non-for-profit educational and training organization this education award can be offered as match.  Grant-funded research associates cost the agency $13.60/hour, so the contract total will vary depending on the length of contract. Non grant-funded associateship contracts vary drastically based on a number of factors including length of contract, rate of pay, overtime, travel, training, and the need for additional resources such as office space, use of GIS labs, use of GPS or other equipment, and vehicle use and/or rental.  One convenient base for determining an appropriate rate of pay is the federal pay scale in which the hourly rate without insurance and including all GBI program administration costs for a GS 4 equivalent is $16.48, GS 6 is $20.56, GS 8 is $25.29, GS 9 is $27.94, and GS 11 is $33.80. IV. Basin and Range Forestry Program: Basin and Range Forestry (BRF) offers professional forestry services to communities at the wildland-urban interface throughout the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada Region.  Our extensive experience in forestry consulting, forest fuels management, and community capacity building provides public land managers and private landowners with a wide range of turnkey forestry services.  By fostering public and private partnerships in collaborative fire management initiatives, BRF is a leader in improving forest health and making our communities fire safe. In an effort to reduce the ecological footprint, BRF has acquired a Bitterroot Miniyarder and a BobCat.  As well, a Vermeer Chipper and 7x10 hydrologic-lift dump trailer, which is used to transport biomass to designated sites, have been purchased to increase productivity and cost effectiveness.  All BRF crews possess a full compliment of forestry equipment, and all sawyers are certified to operate and maintain forestry equipment and possess the necessary skills for accurate, directional felling.  8 member crew @ $28.69/hr x 40 hrs/wk = $ 9,180.80 V. International Conservation Volunteer Exchange (ICVE): ICVE is a volunteer program for International participants who wish to collaborate with American work crews on environmental projects throughout Nevada's public lands. ICVE is based on the philosophy that international understanding and goodwill can be achieved through cooperating on the shared goal of improving the environment. By attracting a corps of conservation-minded volunteers, ICVE contributes to the breakdown of cultural barriers while advancing ecological awareness on a global scale.  GBI has collaborated with numerous international environmental exchange programs and provides volunteers an opportunity to spend their time in the US working side-by-side with NCC members assisting with field research and restoration projects.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This notice replaces notice dated 27 Sep 2004, reference number DECON, with an original response date of 8 Nov 2004.  That notice is cancelled and replaced by this posting.  The classification code is changed from 42 – fire fighting, rescue & safety equipment to 68 - Chemical and Chemical Products, and the response date is now 30 November 2004.
DESCRIPTION:  The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager is examining all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within, which have been exposed to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).     This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards. JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.

This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.     Mature, is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.     TRL-6 means that a system prototype has been demonstration in a relevant environment.     Prototype system is well beyond the breadboard and has been tested in a relevant environment.     Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.     Your applicator/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered. Your applicator/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.
Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on non-removable sensitive pieces of equipment, located in vehicles, aircraft or shipboard areas. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or ?slip ins? are acceptable).     Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: l) Demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.     Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign. 2) Demonstrate a decontamination efficacy to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.     3) Supply decontaminant/ system information on material compatibility. The general materials in the various platforms consist of categories such as plastics, alloys, elastomers, metals to name a few. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided. 4) Supply Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all products.     5) Provide evidence of production capability/capacity. 6) Not produce any uncontrollable hazards (residue or secondary) that are toxic or corrosive during decontamination operations. 7) Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options.     8) Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.     9) Be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) clothing and not present a hazard to equipment or personnel while being operated in MOPP.     10) Using its product, provide the results of developmental and operational testing in the decontamination of integral sensitive equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, and terrain.     11) Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment, aircraft, vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within. 12) Identify on-going federal, commercial, DoD contractual effort that is within scope of the above objectives along with point of contact and contact information. 
NOTE:     Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated (e.g. surety, material compatibility, pot life, shelf life, etc.) data.

For submissions to be considered as decontamination systems, developers/sponsors must electronically supply (.doc or .pdf format) the preceding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Leo Gomez, leo.gomez@brooks.af.mil, no later than close of business November 8, 2004. Telephonic and hard copy responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

This NOI is not a small business set aside.    The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on sole source bases logistical and administrative support from Matrics Assessment, Inc., 914 Westwood Blvd., Suite #512, Los Angeles, CA  90024 to work to develop and oversee the process that will lead to the translation of the Matrics Neuropsychological Test Battery into three (3) languages.  

In order to facilitate treatment development for cognition in schizophrenia, the NIMH supported a process (Matrics) to achieve a broad evidence-based consensus regarding the best available method for measuring cognition in pharmacological trials targeting the cognitive deficits of this disorder. The individual tests selected through this process have been obtained, in some instances licensed from their owners, and packaged for easy administration by academic and industry clinical investigators. In addition, a standardized set of test materials and instructions for test administration has been created. To be of maximal utility to those concerned with drug development, the MATRICS Battery must be adapted for use in other countries.  The overall goal is to insure the creation, standardization, and distribution of foreign language versions of the MATRICS-created cognitive battery or substitutes consistent with the overall MATRICS approach.   A number of inter-related tasks must be accomplished in order to achieve the objective of insuring the availability of a standardized version of the MATRICS cognitive battery. These will include:  1)  Negotiating an agreement acceptable to the owners of individual component tests to allow or oversee the translation of their tests; 2)  Convene a MATRICS Editorial Board to oversee strategic planning and quality assurance for all projects related to the MATRICS Neuropsychological Battery; 3)  Develop a plan to translate Test Administration and Scoring Manuals to assure standardized use of the test among diverse end users; 4)  Develop a plan to create and assemble standardized versions of actual test materials including Administrator Record Forms, Patient Response Booklets, paper and pencil test components, computerized components, and scoring sheets for diverse end users; 5)  Continued warehousing original final test product and maintaining sufficient stock to insure availability of test material to TURNS investigators, other academic investigators and industry investigators; 6)  Insure subsequent production of sufficient final test materials to meet demand of investigative community over the useful life of the test product and plan to provide technical support (on a limited basis) to MATRICS Battery NIMH grantee end users .

The sole source justification is Matrics is the sole supplier and distributor to cluster their individual component into a final battery.  Therefore, the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source (FAR 6.302-1 (2)).  This requirement is being conducted under FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

This effort will include requirements for developing, maintaining, sustaining and supporting SADL and TMPG including radio hardware and software upgrades (technical refresh), supporting material, associated component parts as required as well as engineering support, technical assistance and consultant services on operational applications of the data link itself. Development, maintenance, sustainment, and support includes, but is not limited to; the development of upgraded releases in response to operational requirements, the diagnosis and correction of system malfunctions including deficiency report tracking, modifications, corrections, and other revisions for the defined period of performance. It also includes developing, updating, and maintaining existing and future SADL and TMPG documentation as well as providing engineering and technical support to government SADL and TMPG management, logistics, and user organizations.  Configuration management of software releases will also be required. The contractor must have the current capability to, upon execution of this contract, immediately provide diagnostic testing, installation, training, maintenance, expert engineering support and technical refreshments and upgrades to SADL and/or TMPG.    The contractor must demonstrate an in-depth understanding of SADL, the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS), Link 16, and TMPG and be able to immediately and expertly execute all aspects of this contract’s requirements.  The contractor must also be authorized to obtain and store all cryptographic and associated materials required for SADL operation. SADL is a secure, antijam, time division multiple access data-link installed on Combat Air Forces’ F-16C+ and is currently being integrated into the A-10.  Data link information is displayed to the pilot depending on the aircraft’s operational flight program implementation (e.g., the information is presented on the F-16C+’s multi-function display system and heads up display).  SADL, using the EPLRS radio, provides both air-to-air and air-to-ground information to the pilot regarding the position of other SADL-equipped aircraft as well as friendly ground force positions being exchanged on the US Army’s and/or US Marine Corps EPLRS tactical internets.  SADL and Link 16 platforms can also exchange situation awareness and command and control information via a ground-based or airborne system employing TMPG.  A gateway also allows the SADL-equipped aircraft’s position to be transmitted to Link 16 platforms such as AWACS, JSTARS, Control and Reporting Centers, etc. using the J-Series message family. SADL operates using the EPLRS software.  Note: EPRLS Software is subject to Patent/Data Rights and Security clauses.  Raytheon, a contractor based in Los Angeles, California, developed and has restricted data rights for EPLRS software.  The Government has unlimited data rights TMPG software which has been developed at the government expense.  All contractor responsibilities specified in the contract that pertain to TMPG will cease with the completion of EPLRS v11xy fielding (circa end of CY07). The Period of Performance for this effort will be three years. Respondents must provide detailed information in a qualification package of no more than ten double-spaced, single-sided pages.  All small business and disadvantaged sources should identify themselves as such.  Potential sources will be evaluated and determined qualified/unqualified based on the areas listed above.  Each respondent will be advised in writing of the results of this evaluation.  Any firm initially judged to be unqualified will be provided a copy of the solicitation upon request, and any firm submitting an offer will be evaluated without prejudice.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  For questions concerning SADL contact the Deputy Program Manager, Mr. Robert Roe at (781) 377-2735, e-mail bob.roe.ctr@hanscom.af.mil.  The contracting point of contact (contracting specialist) is Mr. Patrick Jackson, (781) 377-1721, e-mail patrick.jackson@hanscom.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Small Diameter Bomb Increment I Focused Lethality Munition (SDB I FLM)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SDBI-06-0001
<ARCHDATE>04272006
<CONTACT>Bridget Tuominen, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)882-7321 X2254, Fax (850)882-0657, Email bridget.tuominen@eglin.af.mil - Laura Klepper, Contract Specialist, Phone 850-882-7321X3213, Fax 850-882-9473, Email laura.klepper@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>Funds for this effort are not currently available, however, the Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB I) Program Office, Air-to-Ground Munition Systems Wing / Miniature Munitions Systems Group (AGMSW/MMSG), Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, intends to issue a contract to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company, for integrating and testing a Small Diameter Bomb Increment I Focused Lethality Munition (SDB I FLM).  The SDB I FLM is an advanced fill in a composite-cased warhead integrated into the existing SDB I weapon system including the SDB I airframe, fuze firing train, and guidance/navigation hardware.  This effort is in response to the warfighter’s urgent operational need to provide the F-15E, and potentially other airborne platforms, the ability to prosecute targets having collateral damage sensitivity.  The SDB I FLM will allow the warfighter to prosecute high-value targets in a complex battle space, increasing combatant commanders’ options while decreasing collateral damage.  This effort includes integrating an alternate warhead (composite case and advance fill) on the SDB I airframe; integrating the SDB I FLM on the F-15E (but not limited to F-15E); integration-related support; engineering studies and support; test support; and procurement of test assets and approximately 50 SDB I FLM residual assets (2006-2008 timeframe); fielding and sustainment support (2008-2009 timeframe); and follow-on production of up to 450 SDB I FLM assets and associated hardware.  The timeframe for follow-on production is 2009-2012, assuming formal milestone approval.  This effort is anticipated to be awarded under multiple contracts with Cost Plus Fixed Fee for integration, testing, and procurement of test and residual assets, with an incentive clause for schedule, performance and cost; Time and Material for sustainment support; and Firm Fixed Price options for production of the SDB I  FLM weapons and associated hardware.  

The Boeing Company is the current SDB I prime contractor and has sole responsibility for performance and warranty of the SDB I weapon system.  To perform this effort, a contractor must have a detailed knowledge of the SDB I weapon system, including all of its subcomponents, and be familiar with the system modes of operations to meet performance specifications.  This is necessary to understand the SDB I performance characteristics and weapon system interfaces to integrate a new warhead with explosive fill with the SDB I weapon system design and deliver the SDB I FLM capability in less than 24 months.  The Government does not own/possess a Technical Data Package for the SDB I weapon system nor will the Government provide one to complete this effort.  

This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract.  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact the Contracting Officer, Ms. Bridget Tuominen, at (850) 882-7321 extension 2254 or the Contract Specialist, Ms. Laura Klepper, at (850) 882-7321 extension 3213.  For technical information, contact the SDB I - FLM Program Manager, Captain Lou Ruscetta at (850) 882-7321 extension 2728.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Space Based Infrared Technology Branch (AFRL/VSSS), at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors for the Imaging Spectrometer Focal Plane Array (ISFPA) program. The intent of this program is to posture the DOD for current and future-generation hyperspectral sensing applications by developing a single, multipurpose, high performance, large format array that operates simultaneously in the Visible and Short Wavelength Infrared (VIS-SWIR).  The Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) sensor unique concept has been structured to address constraints and complexities imposed by current generation Sensor Chip Assembly (SCA) technology.  The Government anticipates that the combined value of Task 1, 2, and 3, with the potential for multiple awards, will be between $3 and $6 Million and will be accomplished within a two year time frame.  The ceiling for the entire effort, all tasks and including multiple awards is estimated at $9.7 Million.  The driving goal for this program is to deliver initial “flight-grade” arrays for insertion into a demonstration system within two years from contract award.  AFRL/VSSS is pursuing a 4-phase (via task orders) approach to the delivery of the ISFPAs from concept to development of engineering and “flight-grade” demonstration arrays:  Task 1 will comprise the preliminary design addressing HSI unique priorities.  Task 2 will be the development to the Critical Design Review (CDR).  Task 3 will be the fabrication of two (2) engineering and two (2) “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs.  Task 4 will consist of the production of additional “flight-grade” SCAs. 
B. Current technology shortfalls limit air-borne and space-borne tactical system design options, impose collection and post-collection processing complexities, and limit achievable performance metrics.  System designers must accept reduced swath widths or sizeable dead zones associated with butting arrays or implement complex pointing maneuvers to achieve coverage requirements.  Coupled with the desire for large-format arrays is the need to successfully operate over a wide dynamic range.  The dynamic range constraints could be partially addressed by providing a wide range of variable frame times as well as by recognizing that scene irradiance varies significantly over the spectral band opening the door to variable conversion gains across the spectral dimension of the SCA.  High pixel operability is yet another critical parameter.  Therefore, in summary, the Government has identified four (4) critical technology advances for this program: (1) the hybridization of high-yield, large format arrays with minimal dead zones, (2) the development of next generation read out integrated circuit (ROIC) designs compatible with large format arrays incorporating on-chip  Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC), (3) ROIC designs for high frame rate conditions and high linearity over a large dynamic range, and (4) the development of high-performance, VIS-SWIR SCAs addressing operational and storage-life constraints.  Desired features of this SCA include operation in the visible through short-wave infrared spectral bands, programmable frame time, programmable conversion gain, large format, and on-chip ADC.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to contact the technical POC to verify interest in the effort to be proposed as well as to obtain the program specific goals (provided in a separate document).  The contractor will investigate methodologies, which include designing and/or processing of detector arrays and ROICs to improve performance and radiation tolerance based on the goals provided.  A minimum of two (2) flight-grade and two (2) engineering-grade SCAs are expected as deliverables to AFRL as a result of this program.  This program may include delivery of additional SCA deliverables (this is a potential task order number 4).

C. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards using Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts consisting of tasks for preliminary design (Task 1), detailed critical design (Task 2), fabrications of engineering and “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs (Task 3), and possibly additional “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs as a potential task order number 4.  Up to three (3) contract awards may be made depending on the quality of the proposals received and funds available.

Task 1: The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee Contract for Task 1.  Task 1 will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract’s guaranteed minimum order requirement.  Task 1 is anticipated to be a four (4) month effort to accomplish the preliminary design of the technical goals.  Initial proposals shall include substantiation of specialized experience.  The exit criteria for this task will include providing supporting evidence that overall program cost, schedule and risk are at an acceptable level to proceed into further levels of development.  Risk mitigation factors for successfully accomplishing Task 3 must also be addressed.

Task 2 is anticipated to develop the detailed design of the VIS-SWIR ISFPA.  The overall goal of this task will be to mature the design to the critical design level addressing the technical goals of the program. Again the exit criteria for this task will include providing supporting evidence that program cost, schedule, and risk are at an acceptable level to proceed into fabrication, demonstration, and test.  Risk mitigation factors for successfully accomplishing Task 3 must also be addressed.

Task 3 is anticipated to address the fabrication and testing of ISFPAs.  The overall goal of this task will be to fabricate two (2) engineering SCAs and two (2) demonstration SCAs.  

Task 4 is anticipated to fabricate additional “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs.

D. A separate in-depth description of the goals of this effort is available upon request.  Because of ITAR requirements, all requests for goals must be accompanied by a copy of the DD 2345 or JCP confirmation number.  The goals will then be sent to the address of record on the DD 2345.  Design parameter goals have been categorized as A, B, or C priorities based upon relative importance to Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) sensor goals and objectives.  Category A parameters represents the highest priority.  Categories B and C may be traded for lower risk, cost, and/or improved performance.  Offerors should review and respond to all of the goals, with greater emphasis given to the higher priority items. Offerors should structure their program such that risks of attaining the goals are minimized with respect to yield, cost, and schedule.  All requests for information shall be directed to AFRL/PKVS by contacting Mr. Wayne Zitzka, at email wayne.zitzka@kirtland.af.mil, or via phone at (505)-846-4987.

DESCRIPTION:  The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager is examining all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within, which have been exposed to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).     This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards. JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.

This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.     Mature, is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.     TRL-6 means that a system prototype has been demonstration in a relevant environment.     Prototype system is well beyond the breadboard and has been tested in a relevant environment.     Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.     Your applicator/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered. Your applicator/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.
Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on non-removable sensitive pieces of equipment, located in vehicles, aircraft or shipboard areas. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or ?slip ins? are acceptable).     Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: l) Demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.     Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign. 2) Demonstrate a decontamination efficacy to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.     3) Supply decontaminant/ system information on material compatibility. The general materials in the various platforms consist of categories such as plastics, alloys, elastomers, metals to name a few. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided. 4) Supply Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all products.     5) Provide evidence of production capability/capacity. 6) Not produce any uncontrollable hazards (residue or secondary) that are toxic or corrosive during decontamination operations. 7) Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options.     8) Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.     9) Be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) clothing and not present a hazard to equipment or personnel while being operated in MOPP.     10) Using its product, provide the results of developmental and operational testing in the decontamination of integral sensitive equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, and terrain.     11) Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment, aircraft, vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within. 12) Identify on-going federal, commercial, DoD contractual effort that is within scope of the above objectives along with point of contact and contact information. 
NOTE:     Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated (e.g. surety, material compatibility, pot life, shelf life, etc.) data.

For submissions to be considered as decontamination systems, developers/sponsors must electronically supply (.doc or .pdf format) the preceding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Leo Gomez, leo.gomez@brooks.af.mil, no later than close of business November 30, 2004.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Crane Division.  Offerors are encouraged to access information also available on the NSWC Crane Division web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/homepage.htm. Revised Synopsis – It is anticipated that $4M of funding will be available for year one.  It is anticipated that the 3-year contract will not exceed $9.9M. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires development of a “pre-packaged brass board” of an Ultra Short Pulsed (USP) laser, which shall be transportable and suitable for use in exploring USP laser applications at a number of laboratories and test sites.  The package shall be complete with power supplies and cooling, and output optics capable of “pre-chirping” the output beam, as identified in the Statements of Work.   An additional requirement is the employment of fiber based extreme pulse stretching.   Phase I - The first phase consists of the demonstration of two operational wavelengths for high energy per pulse high average power and the design of the pre-packaged brass board.  The contractor shall research appropriate hardware and technologies required to develop two bench top-level USP lasers for both a ~1µm and a 1.5µm version.  The contractor shall provide a bench top-level demonstration, which shall provide a minimum functionality for both a ~1µm and !  a 1.5µm.   Corrected:  The fiber based stretching factor for 1µm Program Goals is 10 ns of compression capability at 5 mJ/pulse energy with 10nm bandwidth at a center wavelength of 1µm.  The fiber based stretching factor for 1.5µm Program Goals is 10 ns of compression capability at 200µJ/pulse energy with 10nm bandwidth at a center wavelength of 1.5µm.  Phase II - Phase II Final Delivery of Pre-Packaged Brass board USP Laser.  The contractor shall perform all necessary research and then develop the final design, build, test and verify performance, and deliver the transportable, “pre-production brass board” USP laser system.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY.  

   ***** The deadline for receipt of survey responses has been EXTENDED TO 4:00 PM FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 2006. ***** 

The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cni.navy.mil), is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President’s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing their shore safety activities which include Navy Occupational Safety and Health (NAVOSH), Explosive Safety, Traffic Safety, Recreation and Off-Duty Safety.

In accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, market research is being conducted to seek industry assistance during preliminary planning in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the shore safety activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as a strategic sourcing solution.     

This requirement involves providing Shore Safety Services, which include Navy Occupational Safety and Health (NAVOSH), Explosive Safety, Traffic Safety, and Recreation and Off-Duty Safety (RODS) as described below.  Firms are requested to participate by completing the survey at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under solicitation number N62467-06-R-0091 and forwarding via email to the POC identified below NOT LATER THAN 4:00 PM Eastern Time, March 24, 2006.  You will need to register on the e-solicitations website in order to download the necessary documents.  Participation is voluntary; respondents will not be paid for participation.  

Small business sources will be considered in this research.  

A contract will NOT result from this market research, but one or more separate solicitations for the services described herein may be issued in the future.  

Research Method.  The method of conducting market research for this potential requirement is through such means as informal Internet searches, telephone interviews, and discussions with potential commercial sources and industry experts.  The questionnaire posted at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of this research.  Note: This is to advise any commercial source providing information as part of this market research process that your information will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should you choose to submit a proposal in response to any solicitation that may result in the future.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement

NOTE:  The NAIC Code for this Sources Sought is changed from 541990 to 541710.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological (CB) Defense Science and Technology (S&T) Program is seeking interested sources capable of innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including materials science, computer science, chemistry, biology, medical research and systems engineering.  To satisfy these requirements, for the first time in its history, DTRA anticipates the use of Other Transactions to reach sources that do not traditionally respond to Government solicitations.  It is also anticipated that traditional sources and traditional contracts, grants and cooperative agreements may be used. DTRA plans to release a draft Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on or about November 15, 2005 and a final BAA in late February 2006.  
Research activities within the CB Defense S&T Program fall into the following categories:

o     Medical science and technology programs look at pretreatments (i.e., vaccines) diagnostics, therapeutics to counter both existing and emerging threats;
 
o     Physical Science and Applied Technology programs focusing on Collection, Detection, Protection, Decontamination, Modeling & Simulation, and Support Science & Technology; and 

o     Technology Transition Programs focus on Transition Planning, War-fighter Enhancement, Test and Evaluation, and Homeland Defense.

DTRA is seeking those organizations with the capability to identify, seek and establish relationships with non-traditional and traditional entities capable of providing required solutions or technologies to support the CB Defense and S&T Programs over the next five years.  Flexible organizations and organizational structures are a must, to adapt to the changing CB S&T environment.  DTRA will consider all possible relationships proposed by offerors that provide a flexible, commercially compatible agreement that facilitates basic and applied research, and prototype development, demonstration, and evaluation for commercial applications and technologies.  Potential sources having the capability necessary to assist the CB Defense S&T Program in identifying and pursuing the above services are invited to provide information demonstrating their capabilities.  
Information submitted should demonstrate the firm’s capability to reach the largest pool of traditional and/or non-traditional defense contractors in the areas identified above, and clearly identify the methods used to obtain sources, technologies, products and services related to CB Defense S&T.  Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status, if applicable, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  It is requested that capability statements be in PDF Format and be limited to five (5) pages in length.  This is a request for information for planning purposes.

DTRA plans to hold an initial Industry Day on or about December 15, 2005 for interested parties.

Information regarding where and when to submit capability statements will be posted to this website:  

https://cbd.cnttr.dtra.mil  

Stay tuned to this web site for further information.

Questions may be directed to Herbert Thompson at (703) 325-6627 or Mary Poole at (703) 325-7658.  Please address e-mail inqueries to herbert.thompson@dtra.mil or mary.poole@dtra.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the remaining questions and answers:

1.	Will a RFP response in .pdf be acceptable to DCMA?
Ans: Yes
2.	Will a secret clearance with a NAC or NACLAC investigation fulfill the ADP II requirement?  
Ans: Adjudicated NAC or NALC is sufficient for this effort.

3.	Will DCMA provide a DD254 upon award? 
Ans:  DD 254 is not required for this effort

4.	PAST PERFORMANCE FORM:  In reference to contracts that have been terminated for default: is that in reference to the set-a-side part of the contract?
Ans: This requirement is for full and open competition.
5.	Information to be Completed by Offerer: Is Part II to be filled in by SP or is that what the government is going to fill out when contacting the references offered?
Ans:  SP complete Part I; providing the info in Part I for a minimum of three (3) references, and submitted with your proposal.  The Govt. will complete Part II while contact your references.
6.	What is the anticipated award date? 
Ans: Depend on number of the proposals received; the evaluation time might take longer.
6.	If DCMA responses to questions are not issued before March 25, will DCMA extend the due date for the proposal one week? 
Ans: No.
7.	“An offer may be rejected or not be considered for award if it is materially unbalanced. An offer is considered to be materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less for some deliverables.” Question is: Was this meant for the “set-a-side” part of the bid or is this still in effect? If this is still in effect, please give two or three examples of what is defined as being “materially unbalanced.
Ans: This effort is for full and open competition.  An offer is considered to be materially unbalanced when it is based on price significantly less for some deliverables, and/or prices which are significantly higher for other similar deliverables.

The following question was received and with the following response.  Question:  The announcement states that:  The offeror m ust substantiate their notional AATE configuration relevant to existing system upgrades or emerging Army platforms.  Can the Army supply information on existing system upgrades or  emerging Army platforms?  Answer: The chart found at link (http://www.aatd. eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Acc_Announ.asp) details the Army's current plans relative to existing and emerging platforms.  Note that this is a long range planning document and subject to change.  The term Upgrades in the statement above refers generically to potential upgrades to the existing platforms that could arise from the offeror's notional AATE configuration or technologies being applied to an existing platform or how the offeror's AATE technology could benefit a planned upgrade to  a given platform. This office does not have an all-inclusive list of the planned upgrades to the various Army air vehicles/platforms.  Each offeror must use their contacts with OEMs or other sources to attain this information.  ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITO NS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

Firms responding to this announcement are hereby advised that participation in this survey does not constitute a contract or government obligation for future solicitations or contract awards. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Below is a description of B-1 BRU-56 Ejector Rack Modification requirements and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide insight on your company’s capability to meet this requirement.

If, after reviewing this document, you desire to participate in the market research / sources sought, you should provide documentation that supports your company’s capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to gain adequate insight of your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  
The B-1 System Group (B1SG), Aeronautical System Center (ASC), Wright- Patterson Air Force Base is planning to modify existing BRU-56 Ejector Rack, Configuration Item (CI) number 750015A, for carriage, jettison, and employment of MIL-STD 1760 and Modifiable Ballistic (MB) weapons on the B-1 Multi-Purpose Rotary Launcher (MPRL).

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) only*. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. 

The 99th Contracting Squadron, Nellis AFB NV, is conducting market research for a contractor to execute the USAF Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battlab (UAVB) Miniaturized Synthetic Aperture Radar (MiniSAR) Initiative.   The MiniSAR Initiative is a USAF Warfare Center Commander approved, and UAVB led, initiative to integrate Sandia National Laboratory’s MiniSAR onto an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).  The purpose of this initiative is two-fold.  First, demonstrate the ability to integrate MiniSAR onto a tactical UAS.  Second, demonstrate the military worth of MiniSAR in Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection and in urban operations.  

The MiniSAR initiative is planned as a four-phase project with a total duration of one-year.  Phase one defines the integration and interface requirements between the UAS and the MiniSAR sensor.  Phase two covers both the fabrication of the UAS and the integration of the sensor into the UAS.  Phase three consists of the ground testing and flight demonstration.  Phase four is a concept demonstration in a tactical scenario.  The following general services are required in order to execute this initiative:

	a. Production of a UAS.  Minimum technical requirements are: 100 pound payload capacity, 12 hours flight duration at cruise, 300 Watts sustained power production, operate in 30 knot winds, auto takeoff and land capability, austere field operations capable, remotely piloted and autonomous operations; on-board processing; real-time reprogrammable mission computer; line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight communications and control; 18 cubic feet internal payload volume, 10 inch external ball capable, landing gear capable of protecting sensor ball, proven platform design, and platform readily available for modification to support the MiniSAR.  The UAS shall also have a ground control station capable of mission planning, flight training, mission execution, multiple aircraft command and control, and simultaneous connectivity between aircraft and multiple ground stations for data download.

b. Production of a lightweight, high performance synthetic aperture radar.  The radar chosen is a government off-the-shelf (GOTS) system developed by Sandia National Laboratories.  Performance specifications are classified.  The contractor will work with Sandia National Laboratories to execute design, integration, installation, and operation of their GOTS SAR on the UAS.    

Potential follow-on efforts:  Based upon the success of the initial demonstration, a planned transition option exists.  Additionally, there could be subsequent efforts to demonstrate the MiniSAR sensor in conjunction with other sensor systems.  At that time, the UAVB will analyze the current state-of-the-art UAS available.  

If you feel you can provide the products and services listed, please provide a 3-10 page Capabilities Statement, addressing the items below, to 1Lt Cassandra Proctor at cassandra.proctor@nellis.af.mil and 1Lt Micah O’Neal at micah.oneal@nellis.af.mil, NLT 1000 PST on 3 April 2006:

·	What capabilities does your organization possess to successfully accomplish the requirements described in this RFI?
·	How will your company approach the requirements in this RFI? (i.e. payload, power)
·	What is your business size (e.g., 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, large business, etc.)?
·	If a solicitation for this effort were issued, would your organization submit a proposal as a prime contractor or a subcontractor?
·	What percentage of this effort would be appropriate for a small business set-aside?
·	Do you hold any contracts similar in work/scope to the services identified above?  Can you provide those contract numbers and their values?  Can you provide a point of contact name/number?
·	Do you have a GSA schedule contract for the services identified above?  
·	Will the Government own the UAV once all phases are completed?  
·	Do you currently have personnel cleared at the TS/SCI level?  
·	If you have any questions regarding this effort please include them in your Capabilities Statement (this will not count against your page limit).

*  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the government.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological (CB) Defense Science and Technology (S&T) Program is seeking interested sources capable of innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including materials science, computer science, chemistry, biology, medical research and systems engineering.  To satisfy these requirements, for the first time in its history, DTRA anticipates the use of Other Transactions to reach sources that do not traditionally respond to Government solicitations.  It is also anticipated that traditional sources and traditional contracts, grants and cooperative agreements may be used. DTRA plans to release a draft Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on or about October 15, 2005 and a final BAA in late February 2006.
Research activities within the CB Defense S&T Program fall into the following categories:

•	Medical science and technology programs look at pretreatments (i.e., vaccines) diagnostics, therapeutics to counter both existing and emerging threats;
. 
•	Physical Science and Applied Technology programs focusing on Collection, Detection, Protection, Decontamination, Modeling & Simulation, and Support Science & Technology; and 
.
•	Technology Transition Programs focus on Transition Planning, War-fighter Enhancement, Test and Evaluation, and Homeland Defense.

DTRA is seeking those organizations with the capability to identify, seek and establish relationships with non-traditional and traditional entities capable of providing required solutions or technologies to support the CB Defense and S&T Programs over the next five years.  Flexible organizations and organizational structures are a must, to adapt to the changing CB S&T environment.  DTRA will consider all possible relationships proposed by offerors that provide a flexible, commercially compatible agreement that facilitates basic and applied research, and prototype development, demonstration, and evaluation for commercial applications and technologies.  Potential sources having the capability necessary to assist the CB Defense S&T Program in identifying and pursuing the above services are invited to provide information demonstrating their capabilities.  
Information submitted should demonstrate the firm’s capability to reach the largest pool of traditional and/or non-traditional defense contractors in the areas identified above, and clearly identify the methods used to obtain sources, technologies, products and services related to CB Defense S&T.  Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status, if applicable, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  It is requested that capability statements be in PDF Format and be limited to five (5) pages in length.  This is a request for information for planning purposes.

DTRA plans to hold an initial Industry Day on or about December 1, 2005 for interested parties.

Information regarding where and when to submit capability statements will be posted to this website:  lhttps://cbd.cnttr.dtra.mil in the near future.  Stay tuned to this web site for further information.

Questions may be directed to Ms. Mary Poole at (703) 325-7658 or via e-mail at mary.poole@dtra.mil.  Anonymous questions may be submitted via the link below.  All questions and responses will be posted to this web site.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS                                                 
The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), located at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is seeking sources to provide a student information system (SIS).

The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if there are any businesses available who are capable of providing a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution to accommodate their academic information systems requirements. The estimated period of performance for this acquisition will be one (1) base year plus one (1) option year, starting approximately 1 October 2006.  If this acquisition is determined to be reserved for small business, the Government will use the information gathered from this Sources Sought Synopsis to develop their bidder’s list. 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources.  Contractors responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall submit the following information to: Christal Green, email:  christal.green@wpafb.af.mil by 12 Noon E.S.T. on Tuesday, 04 April 2006. The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes to establish size standards on an industry-by-industry basis.  The NAICS code for the Student Information Systems Program is 511210 – Software Publishers.  The size standard for this code is based on average annual receipts of $23,000,000.

Background:

The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is the Air Force's graduate school of engineering and management, as well as, its institution for technical professional continuing education.  AFIT accomplishes its mission through three resident schools: the Graduate School of Engineering and Management, the School of Systems and Logistics (a non-degree granting professional continuing education school), and the Civil Engineer and Services School (also a non-degree granting professional continuing education school). Through the Graduate School’s civilian institution programs, AFIT also manages the educational programs of officers enrolled in civilian universities, research centers, hospitals, and industrial organizations. 

Over the past 20 years, AFIT has developed its own in-house student information system (SIS). This system has evolved considerably over time to encompass more than a single information system, and is now a family of products developed to meet the database and information requirements of AFIT’s Graduate School and the institute’s different operating units.  The current system, commonly referred to as AFITMIS, has been developed and maintained by AFIT personnel and contractors without incorporating the best practices found in widely used academic and student information systems. As a result, AFITMIS has grown into a system that requires a significant amount of resources to maintain and modify as AFIT’s student information requirements evolve.  
The SIS acquired by AFIT must perform academic institution operations and functions using off-the-shelf solutions commonly employed by other universities and institutions of higher learning.  The SIS shall employ what are considered best practices in academia.  It must be highly scalable, and provide an open architecture that permits flexible integration and enables data sharing with third party databases, and government developed application programs.  The SIS will utilize industry standard functions and available modules that are already designed and sold commercially.  The development effort for this program will be limited to system integration with AFIT’s existing Oracle 10.1.0.4 database and common operating system platforms (i.e.Windows Server) with all current security patches/service packs.

The SIS must be a fully integrated suite of commercially available software able to perform all of the following academic institution functions: Admissions, Curriculum Management, Financial Management, Human Resource Management, Institutional Research and Reporting, Research Proposal and Grant Management, Student Records Administration, and Student Services.  

The government intends to make a single award to provide all labor, project management, technical support, tools, materials, equipment, documentation, and transportation necessary to install all of the SIS software components onto government furnished computer equipment, to verify the SIS is fully operational and meets all mission critical functional requirements, to train AFIT personnel on the use and operation of the new SIS, and provide on-call technical support during and after the period of contract performance.  The contractor shall provide experienced and qualified personnel in sufficient quantities to perform all required services.  

Those contractor’s intending to provide a learning management system or modify AFIT’s existing commercial applications need not respond.  Our definition of a learning management system is to provide the platform for an online learning environment by enabling the management, delivery and tracking of blended learning (i.e., online and traditional classroom) for employees, stakeholders and customers.  An LMS supports a collaborative learning community, offering multiple modes of learning, and enables administrative and supervisory tasks to be streamlined and automated so the overall cost and impact of education can be tracked and quantified.  

The contractor’s submittal shall be no more than fifteen (15) pages, single-spaced and one sided, in Times New Roman 12 font, with one-inch margins (MS Word document).  The contractor’s submittal can also contain up to an additional five (5) pages of graphic material as necessary. The page limitation does not include the cover letter.  Contractors responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall submit the following information:

1.	The contractor shall provide evidence that as the prime contractor they have successfully provided a complete enterprise level student information system to at least 10 accredited institutions of higher learning with enrollments in excess of 1,500 students during the last three (3) years.  The contractor shall provide at least five (5) current customers POC, addresses, phone number, and description of products and service(s) provided.

2.	The contractor shall provide evidence that shows they have a fully integrated suite of commercially available software that does not require additional code development in order to perform the following academic institution functions: Admissions, Curriculum Management, Financial Management, Human Resource Management, Institutional Research and Reporting, Research Proposal and Grant Management, Student Records Administration, and Student Services. Tailoring of workflow, data tables, and reports may be permissible in order to ensure compatibility of the COTS product with AFIT processes.  


3.	The contractor shall provide documentation that shows their commercially available student information system software will not require any modification or code development in order to properly function and integrate with AFIT’s Oracle  database. The contractor shall describe their approach and ability to provide capabilities and knowledge to support data systems either within industry or government, relative to systems analysis, development, testing and implementation which utilize an Oracle database.

4.	The contractor should provide sufficient evidence of their ability to provide adequate technical support personnel (in number and level), both on-site and remote access, during the integration and installation of the system in order to achieve a full operational capability of the system in a 1 year time frame. The contractor shall identify their experience maintaining multiple complex interfaces crossing multiple systems. 

5.	The contractor shall present evidence of their ability to conduct on-site and distance learning training for their software using materials and tools already developed and implemented by the contractor.  The training should be of sufficient detail and depth as to permit users to properly operate and maintain the software following declaration of full operational capability.

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request.  The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as required basis, for further clarification on material provided.

Questions concerning this requirement should be electronically sent to the Contract Negotiator Christal Green, e-mail: christal.green@wpafb.af.mil, phone: (937) 656-7476.
Responses must be submitted no later than 12:00 PM (EST), Tuesday, 4 April 2006 to Christal Green, e-mail: christal.green@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>Title:                 SOURCES SOUGHT for Driver's Vision System for Tactical                         Wheeled Vehicles  DVE Light This Request for Information (RFI) is a follow up request to RFI W15P7T-05-R-S017 from July 2005.  The Product Manager  Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) is conducting a market research to determine night vision drivers sensor system technology availabilit y for possible use on Army Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (TWV). The Government is looking for a 'sensor system', meaning an imaging sensor, display, and vehicle integration kit. The imaging sensor can be mounted at any point on the vehicle that allows the driv er to see the road ahead.  The drivers display must be located inside the cab, and must not interfere with normal driving functions. Key performance parameters include:  (1) The complete system average unit production cost (AUPC) is $6,000 in Calendar Year 2006 dollars for a qty of 2500 systems.  The complete system unit cost includes all components to be delivered and installed on medium and heavy TWVs to include armored  variants in accordance with the following preliminary requirements by vehicle type:  (these numbers are for planning purposes only). 	FY07	FY08	FY09	FY10	FY11 HEMTT	1428	1220	998	1244	1201 PLS	681	244	353	247	51 HET	484	127	240	331	0 TOTAL	2593	1591	1591	1822	1252 (HEMTT  Heavy Extended Mobility Tactical Truck, PLS  Palletized Loading System, HET  Heavy Equipment Transporter)  (2) The capability for the drivers viewing system shall allow the driver to see and drive the vehicle at speeds from 29-35 MPH on primary roads, 22-25 MPH on secondary roads and 8-9 MPH on cross country terrain during periods of darkness and other degrade d visibility conditions (such as smoke, fog, haze, rain, sandstorms, etc).   (3) System shall be removable by the vehicle operator and installed into the basic mounting kit of another vehicle within 30 minutes (threshold). Key parameters are: (A) Sensor/Camera: must be a passive Infrared (IR) sensor, (B) Display: allows driver to maintain a relaxed driving position while viewing the image and allows for brightness adjustments during day/night operation. (C) The drivers view er sensor system may use vehicle power.          A Draft Performance Specification (DRAFT DVE Light PRF Spec) is provided to offer a more detailed description of the Governments sensor system expectations.  Vendors should feel free to ask questions or submit comments pertaining to the draft performance specification. The current Government schedule of key activities for this effort is as follows (these dates are for informational purposes only and are subject to change at any time): 	(1) Request For Proposal (RFP) release  31 May 2006 	(2) Government receipt of proposals and bid samples  18 July 2006 (2 bid samples per vendor submittal, bid samples are expected to be at least 80-90% compliant to the RFP Performance Specification and data supporting vendor compliance testing is expected  as part of the submittal)  	(3) Contract award  13 September 2006 	(4) Delivery of first fully qualified Production lot  13 March 2007 In order to assist the Government in conducting this market research, vendors are asked to provide, as part of their response to this RFI, cost/performance trade-offs against items in the draft performance specification to meet the cost target.  In particu lar, the Government is interested in understanding the cost savings associated with a reduction in system sensitivity and the cost savings associated with a reduction in reliability.  Other cost/performance trade-offs should include compliance testing crit eria outlined in the draft specification provided.  As a reminder it is the interest of the Government to understand the best possible complete system capability that the vendor can provide meeting the complete system unit cost identified above ($6,000). Cost estimates must separately price all vehicl e integration costs and components and all respondents must address any/all long lead items/parts, and lead time to first unit deliveries.   Additionally, as part of the RFI response, the Government asks for each submitter to review the schedule dates above and provide comments for the submitters capability to meet these dates.  Also submitters are asked to provide a list of dates the submitte r could make on a compressed schedule.   Submitters are asked to provide justification for any shortened time periods from the current Government baseline above.  For evaluation purposes, each potential source is requested to provide a brief description of work previously or currently being performed, which specifically demonstrates the contractor's ability to successfully satisfy the requirement described herein. Firms are also invited to submit any literature, brochures, or references necessary to support claims of being able to meet or exceed the requirement.

<DESC>PURPOSE The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) Cargo Management Branch is seeking information from industry relating to its need for software engineering services required to support the Integrated Booking System (IBS).  Services include requirement definition, software maintenance, development, testing, configuration management, area manager support, training, implementation, deployment, documentation, Web technical support, and project management support. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to ensure an accurate Performance Work Statement, gather data regarding commercial industries interest and ability to meet existing IBS Sustainment/ development goals and objectives, and determine the Governments acquisition strategy. This RFI is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the Cargo Management Branch need.  Currently, IBS suite of interoperable systems consists of the following integrated and interfacing modules: Carrier Analy sis and Rate Evaluation II (CARE II), Requirements Forecasting and Rate Evaluation (RF-RAM), Unit, Sustainment, Commercial Sealift Solutions (CSS), Ocean Carrier Interface (OCI), Web Vessel Schedule (WVS), One-Time-Only (OTO), and electronic Shipper System  (eSS).  These modules provide automated tools to: support carrier contract requirement definition, rate and service solicitations and evaluation; input vessel schedules; book unit and sustainment cargo; produce shipment documentation; provide cargo offeri ng and status information; produce payment and billing information; and provide in transit visibility (ITV) information.  The IBS currently supports identification of requirements, evaluates carrier offers in an efficient and timely manner, and automates e xisting manual interfaces with other SDDC systems and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.  The IBS allows shippers to automatically book requirements directly vice processing them through SDDC booking offices thereby reducing the level of manual interven tion required.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OPTICAL IMAGE STITCHING
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
OPTICAL IMAGE STITCHING

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercially develop our optical image stitching technology for creating broad area imaging arrays.

Background: Researchers at LLNL have developed an image stitching technology that can seamlessly stitch the output of multiple digital image sensors together into one seamless, contiguous image. This permits the use of multiple cameras to create a much larger “virtual” image sensor array.    

Description:  This technology permits the simultaneous generation of single images of objects without the need to move the object or to record multiple images at different times. This technology joins multiple sensors together to form a larger pixel count “virtual” sensor array.  The technique used for this process efficiently produces continuous images from the independent digital image sensors that can be joined without complex computer processing. The technique uses an optical phenomenon described in Theodor Scheimpflug’s 1904 British Patent (GB 1196/1904) to use a set of focal plane arrays and lenses, arranged in such a manner to produce an image that is equivalent in picture elements (pixel) count to the sum of the arrays optically joined, minus a small amount for overlap between adjacent focal plane arrays.  

Advantages: 	It is possible to use this technology with many commercially available digital image sensors. This technology is useful wherever there exists a need for an image sensor that is larger in pixel count than anything commercially available. This technology is beneficial in reducing the cost per pixel by using readily available, relatively low-cost large-area image arrays to replace limited production, high-cost per pixel very large image arrays.  

 
Potential Applications:  

This technology is not limited to visible light imaging system applications, but also can be applied to infrared, ultraviolet, microwave or x-ray imaging regimes. Any imaging or sensor application where the pixel count needed exceeds those of a single sensor can employ this technology.  

Development Status:  

LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention. LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Image Stitching technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 121-06

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Image Stitching technology.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for soil remediation services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 101816Q127 and is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  RFQ 101816Q127 may be viewed thru a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or "http://www.nbc.gov".  For assistance in downloading information from the National Business Center contact the helpdesk at (703) 390-6633.No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08. This is a Set Aside for Small Business.   The NAICS is 562910.   The small business size standard is 13 million.  This RFQ will be awarded upon best value.  The statement of work for these services is as follows: GENERAL:  Numerous petroleum releases have occurred in several locations over a period of years at the Whitcomb Unit fuel storage area.  In 1999, Aboveground Storage Tanks (ASTs) on site were removed and decommissioned.  Petroleum contaminated soil (PCS) was detected under the former pump and product lines.  Excavation of the former pump island was initiated and excavation continued to the south of the fuel pump island.  The vertical extent of the PCS could not be determined, because the equipment on-site could not dig below 12 feet bgs, and PCS was present at 12 feet bgs.  500 tons of PCS to a depth of 12 feet bgs was removed.  Excavation was terminated due to budget constraints.  During excavation, 13 soil samples were taken.  Samples collected from the bottom and from the southeast and southwest sidewalls contained TPH-G and/or BTEX above MTCA Method A cleanup, while samples from the north, northeast and northwest sidewalls did not.  Five monitoring wells were installed to identify groundwater contamination on the site.  In 200, a Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) system was installed to further remediate the site.  The SVE system is currently still in operation.  Groundwater sampling has been done on an annual basis since 2000.  Recent sampling (2005) has shown that the groundwater beneath the site still contains TPH-G, TPH-D and/or BTEX above MTCA Method A Cleanup levels.  Further investigation is needed to delineate the current extent of contamination.  Remediation of the contamination by excavation will be performed once the extent of contamination is determined. DEFINITIONS:  MCTA Method A means the Washington State Department of Ecology, Model Toxics Control Act, Method A cleanup levels (WAC 173-340-704). SCOPE:  The Scope of Work  involves two phases.  The first phase includes the installation of up to five (5) additional monitoring wells to delineate the extents of the groundwater contamination.  Up to five (5) soil borings will be completed to identify the concentrations of contamination in the ground.  The second phase includes excavation of soil contaminated at concentrations above MTCA Method A cleanup levels.  Sampling will be performed during excavation to ensure that all PCS above cleanup MTCA Method A cleanup levels is removed. PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Whitcomb Island Unit, Umatilla National Wildlife Refuge, Benton County, Umatilla, Washington.  The telephone number (541) 922-4661.  Work is planned to occur between April 2006 and September 2006. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:  Work will be subject to observation and inspection by U.S Fish and Wildlife Service personnel.  Acceptance of work is contingent on closure sampling and analysis to confirm cleanup levels have been achieved. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS:  None. AVAILABILITY: The work site is accessible from paved or gravel roads within the Refuge. TECHNICAL COORDINATOR:  Project Manager is Dan Forney, Regional Environmental Compliance Coordinator, Division of Engineering, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181.

INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Department of Commerce, Flower Garden National Marine Sanctuary is in need of Mooring Buoy Maintenance services.  The East and West Flower Garden Banks (EFGB and WFGB, respectively) are shelf-edge topographic features capped by the northernmost coral reefs in North America.  Roughly 350 acres of coral reefs cap the banks, which are home to more than 80 species of algae, 250 species of invertebrates, and 200 species of fish.  They are also important habitat to sharks, sea turtles, and manta rays.  Primary users of the resource are sport divers, sport and commercial fishermen, boaters, and scientists.

Stetson Bank is a claystone and siltstone topographic feature with minimum depths of approximately 65 feet.  Roughly 20 acres of the feature is above 100 feet depth, with numerous pinnacles and dramatic drop-offs.  Hard outcrops are dominated by sponges and fire coral, and reef fish abundance is very high.  The bank is also home to a rich assemblage of invertebrates, stingrays, and sharks, is frequently visited by mantas and whale sharks. 

The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) was designated on January 17, 1992, and was modified in 1996 to include Stetson Bank.  It is one of thirteen protected marine sites in the coastal waters of the United States managed by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Sanctuary consists of three separate areas, located between 70 and 100 nautical miles SSE of Galveston, Texas.  The East Flower Garden Bank is located near 27°54.5'N, 93°36.0'W; the West Flower Garden Bank is located near 27°52.5'N, 93°49.0'W; and Stetson Bank is located near 28°10.0'N, 94°17.9'W.  The FGBNMS is 42.4 square nautical miles in size (19.2 square nautical miles at the East Flower Garden Bank, 22.6 square nautical miles at the West Flower Garden Bank, and 0.6 square nautical miles at Stetson Bank). 
FGBNMS regulations prohibit anchoring of all vessels within the Sanctuary boundaries.  Vessels less than 100 feet in registered length may utilize mooring buoys provided for that purpose.  NOAA seeks to minimize anchor damage by educating the public, enforcing Sanctuary regulations, and providing alternatives to anchoring.  The mooring buoy system installed in the FGBNMS is intended to alleviate the problem of anchor damage to the coral reefs 
This contract will allow for the regular inspection and maintenance of the mooring buoy system.  The FGBNMS will provide the necessary materials for fabricating and repairing the buoys.  The contractor will be responsible for inspecting each buoy on a routine basis, repairing or replacing buoys or buoy components to ensure that the system is in optimum operating condition, and regular reporting of system conditions.

BACKGROUND

The Sanctuary consists of three separate areas, located between 70 and 100 nautical miles SSE of Galveston, Texas.  The East Flower Garden Bank is located near 27 degrees 54.5'N, 93 degrees 36.0'W; the West Flower Garden Bank is located near 27 degrees 52.5'N, 93 degrees 49.0'W; and Stetson Bank is located near 28 degrees 10.0'N, 94 degrees 17.9'W.  The FGBNMS is 42.4 square nautical miles in size (19.2 square nautical miles at the East Flower Garden Bank, 22.6 square nautical miles at the West Flower Garden Bank, and 0.6 square nautical miles at Stetson Bank). 
FGBNMS regulations prohibit anchoring of all vessels within the Sanctuary boundaries.  Vessels less than 100 feet in registered length may utilize mooring buoys provided for that purpose.  NOAA seeks to minimize anchor damage by educating the public, enforcing Sanctuary regulations, and providing alternatives to anchoring.  The mooring buoy system installed in the FGBNMS is intended to alleviate the problem of anchor damage to the coral reefs 
This contract will allow for the regular inspection and maintenance of the mooring buoy system.  The FGBNMS will provide the necessary materials for fabricating and repairing the buoys.  The contractor will be responsible for inspecting each buoy on a routine basis, repairing or replacing buoys or buoy components to ensure that the system is in optimum operating condition, and regular reporting of system conditions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MOORING BUOY SYSTEM

The mooring buoy system currently consists of seventeen (17) anchor points for attachment of mooring buoys: five (5) on the WFGB, seven (7) on the EFGB, and five (5) on Stetson Bank.  All buoys are in depths shallower than 90 feet, in the high diversity, high relief reef zones on the Flower Garden Banks, and near the pinnacles at Stetson Bank.  Anchor points are in hardened reef rock or in claystone.  Future installations will depend on vessel use rates and the condition of existing mooring points, and will be arranged separately.  During the period of this contract, up to three (3) mooring buoys may be added to the system.  The locations of the existing mooring buoy anchor points are as follows:

East Flower Garden Bank

EFG Buoy #1 - 27 degrees 54' 35.9" N, 93 Degrees 35' 49.7" W
EFG Buoy #2 - 27 degrees 54' 31.9" N, 93 degrees 35' 49.0" W
EFG Buoy #3 - 27 degrees 54' 27.0" N, 93 degrees 35' 57.4" W
EFG Buoy #4 - 27 degrees 54' 33.0" N, 93 degrees 35' 59.7" W
EFG Buoy #5 - 27 degrees 54' 38.7" N, 93 degrees 36' 00.5" W
EFG Buoy #6 - 27 degrees 54' 39.9" N, 93 degrees 35' 55.6" W
EFG Buoy #7 - 27 degrees 54' 32.8" N, 93 degrees 35' 55.1" W

West Flower Garden Bank

WFG Buoy #1 - 27 degrees 52' 35.1" N, 93 degrees 48' 54.1" W
WFG Buoy #2 - 27 degrees 52' 31.3" N, 93 degrees 48' 51.3" W
WFG Buoy #3 - 27 degrees 52' 27.5" N, 93 degrees 49' 00.4" W
WFG Buoy #4 - 27 degrees 52' 29.4" N, 93 degrees 49' 04.1" W 
WFG Buoy #5 - 27 degrees 52' 30.6" N, 93 degrees 48' 54.7" W

Stetson Bank

SB Buoy #1 - 28 degrees 09' 57.4" N, 94 degrees 17' 51.5" W
SB Buoy #2 - 28 degrees 09' 59.1" N, 94 degrees 17' 50.5" W
SB Buoy #3 - 28 degrees 09' 59.2" N, 94 degrees 17' 47.5" W
SB Buoy #4 - 28 degrees 09' 57.8" N, 94 degrees 17' 52.3" W
SB Buoy #5 - 28 degrees 09' 55.1" N, 94 degrees 17' 46.1" W

The mooring buoys in use in the FGBNMS consist of following components:
Pickup line -- An approximately 15' x 1-1/2" UV-treated polypropylene line is used for the pickup line.  This line has an eye spliced into each end.
Mooring Buoy and Through-Buoy Line -- The buoys are tapered, 30" in diameter, and are constructed of white plastic, with a blue band.  A 2" diameter PVC pipe passes through the center of the buoy and a PVC bushing is fitted to each end of the PVC pipe in order to minimize line chafing at both ends of the buoy.  Included on each buoy in 3" block lettering is: "PROPERTY OF NOAA", "NO VESSELS OVER 100 FEET", "USE AT OWN RISK", and "FLOWER GARDEN BANKS NMS (800) 715-3271."  Buoys also contain reflective tape approximately 2" wide around their circumference.  The through-buoy line is made of 1-1/2" nylon and passes completely through the buoy and is attached by interlocking eye splices to the pickup line and the drop line.  Alternate buoy types may be substituted at the discretion of the FGBNMS.
Drop Line -- The drop line is made of 1-1/2" 8-braid, UV-treated polypropylene line.  The length of the drop line varies with the depth of the particular mooring buoy location, but total length of the through-line and drop line should be maintained at approximately water depth plus 30 feet.  An eye is spliced into the lower end of the drop line and contains a section of anti-chafing material.  A 3/4" diameter galvanized or stainless steel shackle attaches the drop line to the anchor point.
Anchor Points -- The anchor points are 1" diameter stainless steel, U-shaped rods with 2" tabs welded perpendicular to each end.  Parallel portions of the U-bolts are 12" apart.  Parallel holes 12" apart, 3" in diameter, and either 22"-24" or 60" deep were drilled in the hard substrate.  U-bolts are secured in holes using a mixture of Portland Type II Cement and molding plaster (14:1 ratio).  The points have an exposed, curved section of stainless steel rod for attaching a drop line with a shackle.  Spare shackles may be attached to the U-bolts to reduce contact between shackles attached to drop line and the reef surface.

SCOPE

The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, equipment, services and facilities to monitor and maintain the FGBNMS and continue the technical evaluation of system and maintenance standards.

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

The mooring buoy system shall be inspected at the specified intervals by the Contractor.

ANSWER:  No, a hardware solution will not be allowed/suffice, unless it has the same capabilities as the AOS SkyPipe solution. If not, it must be a software based PEP, with the same capabilities as the AOS SkyPipe solution.

2.  What are the civil works requirements for the 3.8M hub? Without a site survey, these requirements cannot be quoted correctly.  ANSWER:  Please clarify what is meant by “civil works requirements”.  Site survey is addressed in #3, below.

3.  Is there a possibility of pushing the response date out so we can conduct a site visit to determine the site implementation and civil works requirements at the target install site for the hub?  ANSWER:  For those vendors who want to tour the site for the satellite hub installation at Ft. Sam Houston, TX, government representatives will be available for a site survey on Wednesday, March 29, 2006, no later than 9 AM.  Contact person for the site survey is Jack Donohue, 210-221-1572.

<DESC>The purpose of this admendment is to answer questions received from potential offerors. 

Question 1: The room in which the pool is located must have existing equipment, cabinets and the false floor removed in order to assemble the equipment required to raise/lower casks from the pool and perform necessary operations. Will the equipment be removed by NRL prior to initiation of the reload operation or will the contractor be responsible for removal?
Response 1:	This is the contractor’s responsibility.

Question 2:	The frame over the pool which holds the radiation monitor must be removed.  Will this be done by NRL or the Contractor?
Response 2:	This is the contractor’s responsibility.

Question 3: 	It may be necessary to remove/move the water purification system. If necessary will this be done by NRL or the Contractor?
Response 3: This is the contractor’s responsibility.


Question 4:  Will replacement of items covered under 1, 1.A., and 1.B. be done by NRL or the Contractor?
Response 4: This is the contractor’s responsibility.

Question 5: 	Is the 1 ton hoist over the pool operational?  Can it be used by the Contractor as Required?
Response 5:   No, the 1 ton hoist is not currently operational.  NRL will make it operational prior to the proposed work.  Note however that it will not reach to the outside doorway.  Items must be placed at the bottom of the steps to the outside doorway, then lifted by the 1-ton crane.

Question 6: 	Can NRL provide an 8,000 lb forklift for loading/unloading delivery vehicles?
Response 6:  No, because of the liability, the contractor must supply a forklift.

Question 7: 	When the lid of the can containing the existing Co-60 sources is removed the water in the can should be sampled by the Contractor.  Will NRL provide the equipment for counting these samples or will it be supplied by the Contractor?
Response 7:  NRL will have a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detector available to count samples.  A member of the NRL Health Physics staff will be available to operate the HPGe.


Question 8: The contractor will perform work under a RAM license.  Does this present a problem for NRL?  Note: under the RAM license the shipping:transfer shields employed may and will have external radiation levels in excess of 2 mR:hr at one foot.  Because these containers will be stored/handled in a controlled area with no access for unauthorized personnel this should not present a problem.
Response 8:  No. This does not present a problem for NRL.  A restricted area boundary will have to be established and maintained.  NRL Health Physics personnel will work in unison with security guards to maintain restricted access.

Question 9:	What working hours for operations at NRL are permitted?  The Solicitation calls out that cask handling operations, in and out of the pool be accomplished on weekends/Federal Holidays.  Can these operations be performed after normal working hours, i.e. at night?
Response 9: It may not be done at night during the work week.  It may be done at night if it is a weekend or a Federal Holiday.

Question 10: 	What, if any, on-site training for Contractor personnel will be required to work at NRL?  If any, what is the time required for this training?
Response 10:  It is expected the contractor personnel performing the work will be fully trained to do so under an NRC approved license.  Therefore, no additional training will be required at NRL.  It is prudent to allow 1-2 hours in advance of the work for a final discussion between contractor personnel, NRL Health Physics personnel and other NRL support personnel, e.g. security guards, regarding required restricted area distances, the expected time required, and the process of clearing areas and verifying the operation is ready to begin, etc.

Question 11: 	May existing source can and carousel assembly be used?  The Solicitation indicates that this is possible.  If so, will it be necessary to remove the source can and carousel from the pool for Maintenance and re-install?
Response 11:  If the contractor can use the existing source can and carousel to meet the specifications in the contract solicitation, it may do so.  The contractor may perform maintenance and installation of the new source pencils with the existing source can and carousel remaining in the pool as long as all other requirements of the contract solicitation are met.

Question 12:  Section 4 of -  Proposal Requirements-Contract Options,  states that the room in which the irradiator is housed be brought into compliance with 10 CFR 36 requirement.  The pertinent parts of 10CFR36 are 36.23 (i) (Access Control) and 36.29 (b) radiation monitor over pool.  The latest Increased Security requirements of the USNRC are not addressed.
Response 12: Basically the Access Control is accomplished by an Intrusion Alarm with annunciators located both locally and in a remote “Security Office”.  This system should be compatible with other Security systems employed at NRL.  It should be installed by NRL.  If supplied by the Contractor detailed information on “Security Systems” approved for and in use at NRL must be supplied to the Contractor.  No such information was presented in the Solicitation.  Any wiring for such a system to remote facilities must be supplied by NRL.  The system as described should meet the “Increased Security” criteria.

Installation of the intrusion alarm will be performed by NRL personnel.

If the existing Radiation Monitor mounted above the pool is in good working order it should not require replacement.  If the Alarm mode is not remoted to the Security or other designated site this should be able to be accomplished readily with additional wiring and a possible additional relay to meet the Increased Secuity criteria.

If a new Radiation Monitor is to be supplied by the Contractor, the type of Monitor must be specified so that it is compatible with other systems at NRL.  All wiring to Remote locations must be accomplished by NRL.

NRL expects the same monitor to be put back and will wire the alarm into the security operations center.

Question 13: Will the Contractor be required to install the Intrusion Alarm and wire it to a Remote location?  Likewise for a new Radiation Monitor If wiring is required the Contractor will need both Wiring Codes which must be met and detailed architectural drawing of all locations through which wiring must be accomplished.
Response 13: See Response to Question 9.

Question 14:  Section 6 of the Proposal Requirements-Contract Options calls out a new cask for storage of the existing Co-60 sources in the NRL storage facility.  It was assumed that the existing Neutron Products shield used for the initial installation of these sources could be used.  Apparently this cask has significant but minor levels of contamination.  If this cask may be employed to store the existing sources several questions are pertinent as follows:
a. Will NRL move the cask from the Hot Cell facility where it is located to a location outside the room housing the Irradiator and will NRL move this cask back to the Hot Cell Facility after it has been loaded with the existing sources or will this be a Contractor responsibility?
Response 14(a): This will be the Contractor’s responsibility.

b. To avoid contaminating the pool when this cask is used it must be decontaminated prior to pool entry.  Will this cask be decontaminated to acceptable levels by NRL or will this be a Contractor responsibility?
Response 14(b): This will be the Contractor’s responsibility.

Question 15: Are the shield(s) called out in Section 5. of the Proposal Requirements - required to be fabricated using Stainless Steel construction for extended exposure in the pool or is construction using mild steel possible?  Is the weight limit 5,000 pounds?
Response 15: Fabricate the shields using stainless steel for extended exposure in the pool.  The weight limit for section 5 is NOT 5,000 pounds. NRL expects that an individual cask will weigh less than 10 tons. Subject to the specified criteria, the lower the weight the better for ease of handling and to minimize the potential stress to the bottom of the pool.
