<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a follow-on contract to its current contract with Health Research, Inc. (HRI), Menands, New York.
<p>A new follow-on contract is necessary for HRI to continue and extend the Upstate KIDS: The Upstate New York Infant Development Screening Program (Upstate KIDS) project. HRI is uniquely capable of continuing the Upstate KIDS project because, as the research arm of the New York State Department of Health, HRI has access to New York State vital records, administrative databases, and newborn blood spot archives needed to conduct and continue the research and the collaboration of the New York State Department of Health Division of Family Health to arrange for the referral and care of children identified through screening. The new follow-on contract will provide for the following: (1) completing the follow-up neurodevelopmental screenings of over 6,000 enrolled children from New York State (NYS) at 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age and extending the follow-up to include a neurodevelopmental screening at ages 48 and 60 months; (2) continuing to interface with the NYS Early Intervention Program (EIP) to refer children into care; (3) completing or arranging for the completion of the laboratory analysis of the residual newborn dried blood spots archived at the Wadsworth Center Laboratories, particularly for a panel of environmental chemicals; (4) arranging for standardized diagnostic testing by or under the direction of a board-certified Developmental Pediatrician for any of the participant children who failed a screening at 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 months of age and a sample of suitable children for comparison who did not fail a screening, including transportation to and from testing sites across NYS; (5) linking participant information to appropriate NYS registries, such as the Congenital Malformations Registry, and other NYS administrative and health databases; and (6) compiling, cleaning, and documenting a de-identified analytic database for submission to NICHD.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these goals and for the follow-on, HRI has already demonstrated: (1) complete access to New York State vital records, administrative databases, and archived newborn blood spots, including access to the confidential information needed for linkage with the Upstate KIDS cohort; (2) expertise in conducting large epidemiologic studies; and (3) collaboration of a Developmental Pediatrician. HRI has also documented experience in: (1) maintaining and updating large longitudinal tracking and data files; (2) designing and implementing questionnaires for the collection of relevant health and environmental information on children and their families; (3) designing and maintaining the public face of the project, including internet websites and social media sites; (4) arranging and administering neuropsychological screening and standardized diagnostic testing; (5) executing the laboratory analyses and designing the quality control for laboratory analyses of biomarkers and environmental chemicals; (6) acting as a contact point for families in referring identified participants into care; and (7) compiling, structuring, cleaning, and documenting analytic databases for routine submission to NICHD through a secure mechanism. In addition, HRI has established adequate facilities and equipment to perform the work, specifically, (a) access to software and resources to develop and optically scan forms submitted by participants or capabilities for web access data collection; (b) access to an interactive dedicated server to maintain an extensive database; and (c) room available to store and maintain the paper form archives for the project.<br />It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. The anticipated period of performance will be five years.</p>
<p>If there are sources who believe they are able to perform the requirement, they may submit, within 15 days of publication of this notice, two (2) hard copies of a capability statement, limited to 15 pages or less, excluding resumes, which will be considered by this agency. Any proprietary information should be so marked.<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received by the Contracting Officer by 4:00 PM EST 15 days of publication of this notice (May 16, 2011) will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. <br />Inquiries should be directed to: Fred Ettehadieh, Contracting Officer, DHHS/NIH/NICHD/CMB, 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD 20892-7510, (or Rockville, MD 20852 for express/courier service).</p>
