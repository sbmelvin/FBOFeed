<DESC>The Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau intends to conduct a full and open competition for a follow-on tabulation and dissemination system, DADS II.    The acquisition will be conducted using the advisory multi-step process (hereafter referred to as “voluntary down-select”) pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  This synopsis constitutes the Pre-Solicitation Notice. In order to participate in the upcoming DADS II competition, it is mandatory for respondents to submit a written mini-proposal in response to this notice.  The respondents’ mini-proposal and questionnaires shall be submitted electronically to the attention of Michael L. Palensky at DADSO.Acquisition@census.gov and are due no later than May 19, 2006, 3:00 PM Eastern Time.  The Government estimates the release of the formal Request For Proposals (RFP) in September 2006, after technology exchange, with an award expected in March 2007.

The Government intends to have a technology exchange to increase Industry’s knowledge of the DADS Program prior to preparation of proposals (FAR 15.201).  Technology exchange affords the opportunity for the Government to share information with Industry.  In order to adequately prepare for the technology exchange, respondents shall submit a Technology Exchange Goals and Expectations paper (1-page limit).  This paper shall discuss the information respondents would like to receive during technology exchange with the Government.  Respondents shall submit the Technology Exchange Goals and Expectations paper with the mini-proposal.  

Respondents shall submit information that will allow the Government to determine the respondent’s viability as a Prime Contractor.  The information that must be submitted in response to this pre-solicitation notice and the criteria that will be used to make the evaluation, and resultant voluntary down select, are described below.  Information on the DADS Program, including the draft RFP, is available at the following website http://www.census.gov/procur/www/dads2/index.html and contains sufficient information to permit respondents to make an informed decision about whether to participate in this acquisition.  

Respondents’ viability will be evaluated on the following three factors:  Similar Experience, Past Performance and a Technical Document.  

Similar Experience
Respondents shall submit evidence of their, or their subcontractors, Similar Experiences.  The Government will evaluate Similar Experience based upon its relevancy to the size, scope and complexity of DADS. Respondents shall submit information on up to three (3) contracts performed in the past five (5) years. The Government will place greater emphasis on contracts (commercial, Federal, state, local government and foreign governments) of similar size, scope and complexity to the DADS Program.  If respondents have no single contract experience that encompasses all types of experience as outlined in Section C of the draft RFP, the respondent may show relevant experience through a combination of contracts which together show that work has been accomplished which is relevant to the DADS Program.  

Past Performance 
Respondents shall submit evidence of their, or their subcontractors, Past Performance.  The Government will evaluate Past Performance based upon its relevancy to the size, scope and complexity of DADS. Respondents shall submit information on up to three (3) contracts performed in the past five (5) years. The Government will place greater emphasis on contracts (commercial, Federal, state, local government and foreign governments) of similar size, scope and complexity to the DADS Program.  In addition, the Government will consider the extent of overall client satisfaction with respondent performance in several areas including, but not limited to:  managing and directing resources; demonstrating reasonable and cooperative behavior in dealing with clients; controlling costs and meeting schedules in the provision of services and products.  

Technical Document 
Respondents shall submit a technical document discussing their assessment of the challenges and risks associated with the DADS Program requirements as stated in the draft RFP.  The Technical Document will be evaluated based on the respondent’s depth of understanding of the DADS Program as demontrated by their assessment. 

Voluntary Down-select
All respondents will receive, in writing, the general basis for the Government's findings as to their viability or non-viability. In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), respondents are advised that, notwithstanding the findings provided by the Government, respondents may participate in the resultant acquisition.     

Mini - Proposal Submission Instructions

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION DG1350-06-RP-0029


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires contractor services for the development and support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers. Competed in accordance with FAR Part 15. This survey will provide statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition is set aside exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.0 million.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  The Government estimates a fixed price contract to be awarded based on competition for one twelve month period and four twelve month option periods.  The estimated level of effort based on historical experience is 70,000-95,000 respondents per year.  There is considerable demand for a much larger sample, and potential contractors will be encouraged to develop strategies and methods to increase the sample of the program given financial constraints due to funding available.  

The Government foresees holding a pre-proposal conference for this acquisition approximately mid-March, during which potential contractors may obtain better understanding of the work required.  Further details relating to date, time, and location will be included in the solicitation.  Further information on the In-Flight Survey program can be found at the OTTI website: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/research/programs/ifs/index.html

These products must be regulatory compliant, robust, and highly effective at a reasonable cost.  Successful candidates must demonstrate a clear path to regulatory approval, production and end user utility.  They must all be amenable to use in a military environment.

This BAA is focused on developing medical counter-measures to ermerging threats, genetically engineered and nontraditional toxins, virulence factors and microorganisms as biological warfare (BW) threat agents.  An important consideration is a more expedient approach and/or a shorter timeline to advanced development for a potential product.  It is anticipated that these counter-measures would include pre-treatments (including vaccine enhancement technology), therapeutics and basic science to characterize the nature of the threat and identify key targets for intervention or disruption of these agents.  The agent classes that are to be focused on are: intra-cellular bacterial pathogens, hemorrhagic fever viruses and bioregulators. 

Approaches to the objectives for this area include studying the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of natural isolates, identifying common structural elements of specific agents or classes of agents (preferred), elucidating common virulence mechanisms (such as type III secretory proteins), identifying functional domains in toxins and virulence factors, and using this information to develop rapid and effective medical countermeasures protecting against genetically engineered or emerging BW threats.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This publication serves as a notice that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will issue a solicitation for  the Region 10 Records Management Support Services.  EPA Region 10 Superfund Program requires Records Management Support Services be obtained through a contract vehicle in order to serve its customers.  EPA compiles information in many forms which it must be able to readily access. This demands an effective records management system be in place.  Such a program provides consistency in the way records are managed, greater efficiency in the filing and retrieval of documents, increased document security, and improved utilization of available space.  The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining an infrastructure for managing records in an electronic business environment. The contract services will: a) be the primary vehicle by which the Superfund Program will meet its statutory responsibilities regarding federal agency records; and b) aid the program in fulfilling its mandate to provide information about Superfund activities to the public. The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring continuity of management and maintenance for all records generated by the Superfund Program in Region 10, in all media and formats, from receipt thru final disposition. Most tasks will be conducted in the Region 10 Superfund Records Center (SFRC) currently located on the 7th floor of the Park Place Building at 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle WA. The SFRC contains 3,000 linear feet of records storage space and 120 cubic feet of multi-media records storage space.  In addition, another 1,200 linear feet of space is utilized in other in-house locations for the storage of Superfund records materials.  Approximately 5% of work may need to be performed at other in-house locations or at external locations within a one-day commute from the regional office, as well as those that may require overnight travel.  The hours of operation are 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  On a monthly basis, approximately 200 requests for reference and document retrieval services are processed; an average of 1,300 documents is indexed; and an average of 22,500 images is scanned.

EPA will not issue a paper solicitation for this acquisition.  Therefore, the purpose of the FedBizOpps announcement is to notify potential offerors of EPA's requirement and to direct interested parties to the EPA's "Business Opportunities with EPA" Internet World Wide Website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/index.htm. where the solicitation will be posted on or about May 5, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Acquisition Executive, in coordination with the DFAS Contract Services Directorate (CSD) is  developing the acquisition strategy for the Systems Management and Engineering Services (SM&ES) Contract.  The scope of the SM&ES  is to acquire a full range of performance-based Information Technology services necessary  to support the DFAS enterprise infrastructure and information goals. Specifically, contracts awarded are targeted to support development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements, as well as program management functions, to include development of required Life-Cycle Management (LCM) documentation.  Specific details will be described in individual Task Orders issued under the Contract.  

It is anticipated that the SM&ES Contract will be a multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle. The Government intends to conduct this acquisition under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. Contractors will be required to support a minimum of SECRET security clearance.  The period of performance for these contracts will be a one-year base with four, one-year option periods.  The estimated total value of this acquisition is $300 Million. 

DFAS will be conducting Market Research as part of the acquisition planning phase.  As such, it has developed an on-line Market Research Questionnaire which can be found at http://www.dod.mil/dfas/about/BusinessOpportunities/ActiveSolicitations.html  .  The purpose of this survey is to gain a better understanding of the marketplace, including small business participation, commercial and industry best practices, performance metrics and measurements, innovative delivery methods, effective incentive programs and pricing models.  Prospective vendors are encouraged to participate in this market research by completing the on-line questionnaire no later than April 28, 2006.  Requests for an extension will be considered.  

This Market Research is being conducted for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of  DFAS to acquire any products or services.  DFAS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of information obtained from this Questionnaire or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this Questionnaire is voluntary.  

Vendors are advised that Acquisition Solutions, Inc. (ASI), 1655 Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA, has been retained to provide acquisition support during the SM&ES   acquisition to include review of the Market Research responses, development of the RFP requirements, and the eventual source selection process.  ASI is expressly prohibited from competing on this acquisition and will not participate in  recommending a source for award.    

All future messages and documents regarding this acquisition will be found on the FedBizOpp and DFAS Business Opportunity web sites.  The requirements and strategy as stated in the notice are all subject to change as the acquisition evolves.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent from the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division to issue a modification to an existing Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion contract, on an other than full and open competition basis, to Signal Systems Corporation, 877 Baltimore Annapolis Blvd, Suite 210, Severna Park, MD 21146. This contract is for Research and Development (R&D) services to improve the existing signal processing technology of PMA-264 and Air ASW platforms.  Signal Systems Corporation was awarded this contract under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00421-03-R-0106.  Complications common to the R&D process have arisen requiring an extension to complete the effort.  Signal Systems Corporation has been perfoming this effort for two years, and it would be impossible to compete the remainder of the effort.  Any attempt to bring another contractor up to speed would result in an unacceptable duplication of cost and time.  For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Mr. Ben Hansford at (301) 757-9742.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Utah, under contract number N01-NS-4-2359 new requirements to the existing Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) Statement of Work.  These new requirements are for screening compounds for therapeutic activity against convulsions and seizures caused by acute exposure to organophosphorus nerve agent chemical weapons and cyanide. In addition, there will be new requirements to screen compounds for activity against the neurodegeneration associated with acute exposures to these chemicals.  The existing ASP contract routinely conducts an extensive drug discovery and translational science effort aimed at identifying new therapies for advanced development and eventual marketing to treat human epilepsy disorders and modulation of axonal neurotransmission.  Promising compounds are tested through a series of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic evaluations (both in vivo and in vitro screening) that help define a candidate’s anticonvulsant profile including activity, neurotoxicity, and effect on hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes, drug resistance and pharmacodynamic interactions.  These efforts have been carried out under the contract mechanism since 1975 with the University of Utah.  Approximately 800 compounds are evaluated for therapeutic usefulness each year.  Overall testing requirements in the existing ASP include, but are not limited to, anticonvulsant identification, associated neurotoxicity, anticonvulsant quantitation including establishment of effective doses for a panel of relevant tests, pharmacologic differentiation from prototype drugs, evaluation of proconvulsant potential, studies directed toward elucidating anticonvulsant mechanism(s) of action, drug interaction studies, mutagenicity tests, drug resistance and a variety of other standardized tests to determine relevant activity in candidate compounds.  During the past 30 years, the University of Utah has been able to successfully adopt specialized techniques, methods of evaluation and accumulation of extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles for all the current therapeutic agents and new investigational drugs.  This accumulation of data and experiences is the basis by which all new test compounds are pharmacologically compared. This new work will include in vitro screens and animal models to test a candidate drug’s potential therapeutic value against convulsions and seizures caused by exposure to nerve agents and/or cyanide. It is anticipated that annually up to 1200 new compounds will be evaluated for nerve agent protection.  Requirements will include the development, validation, and use of models that utilize relevant exposure scenarios to chemical agents, or models that simulate such exposures.  Examples of models that may simulate nerve agent-induced seizures include the pilocarpine - and kainite-induced epilepsy models.   Requirements will also include the testing of new or existing candidate neuroprotectant compounds for efficacy against neurodegeneration and neuronal/glial damage caused by exposure to chemical threat agents.  For example, neurodegeneration may be assessed via quantitative stereological analysis and the relationship between seizure activity and neuronal damage.  Finally, the new work will include the development of specialized in vivo and/or in vitro models to assess the effectiveness of candidate therapies, e.g. pediatric pharmacotherapy models, drug interactions, for use with pre-existing medical conditions, and efficacy in the elderly.  The ultimate goal of these programs will be to develop new therapies that are fast acting (<10 min), have intermediate duration of action, i.e., effective for a few hours or more, have minimal respiratory depressant effect, can be delivered through non-IV route (IM, IN) appropriate for field conditions, are suitable for a wide demographic range, are stable at room temperature, and can be administered in combination with other appropriate therapies. 
The NINDS believes that the University of Utah is the only known source for performing comprehensive evaluations by virtue of their 30 years of experience, demonstrated expertise, availability of required staff, laboratory and animal facilities, other requisite resources already in existence within the core program, and validated control data on numerous marketed therapies. NINDS' requirement for consistency and compatibility of data derived from these screening procedures is paramount to the success of this program. For the 30 years of the ongoing anticonvulsant screening work performed by the University of Utah, the NINDS is not aware of or doesn’t believe that any other organization possesses the capability or has developed a comparable database upon which work for the new screening objectives will be based exists.  Inability to produce compatible evaluation results to our existing data base would lead to delays in screening new compounds and incurrence of duplicate costs, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government.  A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 ©(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302 .  The University of Utah is considered the only source capable of performing the additional screening analyses and has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION DG1350-06-RP-0029


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires contractor services for the development and support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers. Competed in accordance with FAR Part 15. This survey will provide statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition is set aside exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.0 million.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  The Government estimates a fixed price contract to be awarded based on competition for one eighteen-month period and four eighteen-month option periods.  The estimated level of effort based on historical experience is 70,000-95,000 respondents per year.  There is considerable demand for a much larger sample, and potential contractors will be encouraged to develop strategies and methods to increase the sample of the program given financial constraints due to funding available.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for reducing the personal and property losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes.  Many sources of information are needed to permit researchers to adequately measure the characteristics of the highway safety environment.  NHTSA’s National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) operates a system of crash research teams; which provide detailed nationally representative statistics on motor vehicle crashes and a data base for evaluation of standards and for countermeasures design.  The name of this system is National Automotive Sampling System (NASS).  NASS is composed of two sub-systems, Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and General Estimates System (GES).  CDS focuses on the crashworthiness of passenger cars, light trucks, and vans which;were towed because of damage, whereas, GES collects limited data on other highway crashes in order to produce general estimates.  From 1991 until 2004, CDS has included 24 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) located in 17 states and two quality control Zone Centers.  The GES includes an additional 36 PSUs located in 9 additional states.  In 2005, CDS will increase to 27 PSUs located in 17 states and GES will decrease to 33 PSUs located in 9 additional states.  Each PSU team collects certain information from traffic-police crash reports (PARs), which will be used to generate estimates of the nation’s highway crash experience.  Crash investigations are often required in collecting information.  The investigation of each case includes interviewing drivers and occupants, inspecting scenes and vehicles, reviewing official medical reports and reconstructing crash dynamics.  Each contractor (two contracts will be awarded under this solicitation) is responsible for operating the crash research teams, maintaining the quality of the field research data, and providing technical guidance for each PSU within its Zone Center.  This procurement will provide for continued crash research, quality control and technical guidance by Zone Centers # 1 and #2 for the Crashworthiness Data System and General Estimates System of NASS.  



The period of performance is five (5) years with a six (6) month transition period.  Electronic copies of the RFP and any other documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site or URL for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or the GSA Electronic Posting Service at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Internet sites for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.

5.  The answer to Question No. 8 is revised as follows:

We understand that a review process will take place, however will the review process be facilitated by government officials (government eyes only) or with the assistance of external experts? What obligations of confidentiality will this panel of experts be held to? Further, if awarded a grant, will the research projects under the grant be subject to confidentiality provisions between the government and the grant awardee? 


REVISED ANSWER:

Section IX. GENERAL INFORMATION is revised by Modification 07 to add paragraph K, ACCESS TO PROPRIETY INFORMATION as follows:

Participation in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DTRA01-06-BAA-01 requires SRA International and Northrop Grumman employees to have access to DTRA contractor information including information that may be considered proprietary.

In reference to grants, Section V, PROCUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, paragraph A, of the BAA was amended in modification 03 dated December 9, 2005 to exclude Grants as a potential procurement instrument.  



7.  The answer to Question No. 51 is revised as follows:

51. 
QUESTION:
While the BAA specifically mentions genetic diversity, the pathogenicity of natural isolates, and common virulence mechanisms such as TTSS, it also mentions that agent classes to be focused on are intra-cellular bacterial pathogens, hemorrhagic fever viruses and bioregulators.  Because V. cholerae does not fit exactly into these agent classes per se, I was hoping that you might be able to provide some insight as to whether my studies (as briefly described above) would constitute a suitable proposal for submission.  That is, do you expect to solicit proposals that focus on agents of bioterrorism and disease outside of those specifically mentioned in the BAA?
REVISED ANSWER: 

The focus and intent of the BAA is described in Section I, INTRODUCTION, paragraph 3 of the BAA.


 
8.  The answer to Question No. 91 is revised as follows:

91.

Question:  

Our institute utilizes both targeted gene approaches to therapeutic development of drugs as well as novel vaccine platforms. We have developed a large capacity vaccine platform that can deliver effective protective immunity to multiple pathogens considered important bioterrorist threats that we feel will revolutionize the vaccine industry. Would this subject also be with the scope of the BAA announcement?

Revised Answer:

The focus and intent of the BAA is described in Section I, INTRODUCTION, paragraph 3 of the BAA.


9.  The answer to Question No. 141 is revised as follows:

141.

Question:  

Can you explain what loaded labor rates are?  Are these hourly rates?

Revised Answer:

In Section VI. PROPOSAL PREPARATION. A.2, the last sentence, All pricing information, such as loaded labor rates, shall be rounded to the nearest penny, was deleted in modification 04 of the FedBizOpps notice.

Each page of the technical volume shall be counted except the following:”
 

3)  Section VII. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL PROPOSALS, A. Supplemental Proposal and Contract/Agreement Documentation, is revised to add Paragraph 9. Statement of Work as follows:

	“10.  Statement of Work.

Provide a SOW approximately 3-5 pages in length that is a separate and distinct document suitable for incorporation into the procurement instrument. Do not put proprietary data or markings in the SOW.  Format shall be as follows:

	1.0  Objective
	2.0  Scope
	3.0  Background
	4.0  Tasks/Technical Requirements    
	1st sub-level 4.1 Task
                            2nd sub-level 4.1.1 Sub-task
                            3rd sub-level 4.1.1.1 second level sub-task 
	5.0  Other to include Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs) and other deliverables 
    
To assist the Government in the preparation of the contractual SOW, the offeror is required to submit a proposed SOW which accurately describes the work to be performed. The proposed SOW must contain a summary description of the technical methodology as well as the task description, but not in so much detail as to make the SOW inflexible.  

The following is offered as the format for the SOW.  

          (1)  1.0  -   Objective:  This section is intended to give a brief overview of the specialty area and should describe why it is being pursued, and what you are trying to accomplish.

          (2)  2.0  -  Scope:  This section includes a statement of what the SOW covers.  This should include the technology area to be investigated, objectives/goals, and major milestones for the effort. 

          (3)  3.0  -  Background:  The offeror shall identify appropriate documents that are applicable to the effort to be performed.  This section includes any information, explanations, or constraints that are necessary in order to understand the requirements.  It may include relationship to previous, current and future operations.  It may also include techniques previously tried and found ineffective.

          (4)  4.0  -  Tasks/Technical Requirements:

               (a)  This section contains the detailed description of tasks which represent the work to be performed which are contractually binding.  Thus, this portion of SOW should be developed in an orderly progression and in enough detail to establish the feasibility of accomplishing the overall program goals.  The work effort should be segregated into major tasks and identified in separately numbered paragraphs according to the decimal system above.  Each numbered major task should delineate, by subtask, the work to be performed.  The SOW must contain every task to be accomplished to include a schedule. 

                (b)  The tasks must be definite, realistic, and clearly stated.  Use “shall” whenever the work statement expresses a provision that is binding.  Use “should” or “may” whenever it is necessary to express a declaration of purpose.  Use “will” in cases where no offeror requirement is involved; e.g., power will be supplied by the Government.  Use active voice in describing work to be performed.

               (c)  Do not use acronyms or abb

1.  Section I. INTRODUCTION, paragraph three, in the BAA, is revised to read as follows:

The FY06 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is focused on developing medical counter-measures to emerging threats, genetically engineered and nontraditional toxins, virulence factors and microorganisms as biological warfare (BW) threat agents.  An important consideration is a more expedient approach and/or a shorter timeline to advanced development for a potential product.  It is anticipated that these counter-measures would include, rapid resequencing,  pre-treatments (excluding vaccines), therapeutics and basic science to characterize the nature of the threat and identify key targets for intervention or disruption of these agents.  The agent classes that are to be focused on are: intra-cellular bacterial pathogens and hemorrhagic fever viruses.

The Network is currently designed and sized to support seventeen different locations with approximately 46,000 total IAF personnel and the MNSTC-I Headquarters staff.  The new sites must employ the latest in GSM cellular, microwave radio and satellite technology as well as have the capability of being easily extended to support wired Ethernet and voice over internet protocol (VOIC) phones.  Each site will require a tower, satellite antenna, switch, generato rs, and shelters (both security and sun).  Al Asad must be operational by 30 June 2006 with support through 26 April 2007.  The un-identified site must be operational within 60 days of the contractor having received a notice to proceed with the work and su pport will also be required through 26 April 2007.

Description
The Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland AFB, is contemplating the award of a Near Space Operational System. This system will be an integrated communication repeater system that is balloon-borne to extend radio communications beyond line-of-sight (BLOS).  The system will be designed to launch from a remote location and controlled via a portable Command and Control (C2) system.  The lifting gas used in the system may be hydrogen or helium. Implementation of the repeater system will allow the warfighter to extend the range of indigenous VHF/UHF radios.  This increased coverage will provide the warfighter with improved battlespace awareness and integration of space capabilities with communications and intelligence.  Once established, this repeater can provide a voice or low data-rate link, encrypted or unencrypted, between points on the ground. The communications repeater will also act as a primary payload platform to support secondary payloads.  The system will be designed to support the interface or direct C2 of secondary payloads as needed with or without the use of the communications repeater functions.  The primary payload will support the ability to C2 secondary payloads.  The primary payload and the C2 system will support the ability to send and receive commands to and from a secondary payload. 
	The RSLP SPO issued a Sources Sought Synopsis, Posted on Feb 28, 2006 and amended on Mar 2, 2006 requesting interested source provide Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) to the RSLP Near Space Operational System requirement. Approximately 20 businesses responded with SOCs.  Two or more small businesses were evaluated as capable of meeting the requirement, and were notified in writing.  An Industry Day for small business is scheduled for 12 Apr 06 to further discuss the RSLP Near Space Operational System requirement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at Mac Dill AFB, FL operates two WP-3D aircraft and a Gulfstream GIV.  These aircraft are complex flying laboratories, used to support hurricane research, surveillance and reconnaissance, and other initiatives in areas of global change, atmospheric and ocean research programs for NOAA and the U.S. scientific community.  The nose Radar subsystem (model WXR-700C) is critical for the safety of flight for all projects and is currently installed on both P-3s and the GIV aircraft.  A third P-3 aircraft is being acquired and it is necessary to have the same RADAR on it.

CRAD intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the purchase of two (2) Band Radar Transmitters, three (3) Receiver Control Panels, and one (1) Dual R/T Mount  on a sole source basis with Intertrade Limited Inc. based on the following reasons:  1) Rockwell Collins designed and manufactured the Radar System; 2) The system is a “C” band frequency which we have determined is the best type of system for convective weather flying; 3) Using the same RADAR on all heavy aircraft reduces maintenance costs because less spare units are needed, and it also reduces the training needed for flight and air crews; 4) All units must meet exact form fit and function.  They must be certified operational by an FAA repair station; 5) Intertrade, a Rockwell Collins company, handles aftermarket sales of Collins equipment and is the only responsible source for this equipment; 6) All design documentation is proprietary of Rockwell Collins and could not be re-engineered in a cost effective manner by another vendor or the government.

The anticipated purchase order will have a performance period from date of notice to proceed through August 31, 2006.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Proposals can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required equipment.  The applicable NAICS code is 334220.

DOC, CASC requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.

6. NOTES
(This section contains information of a general or explanatory nature that may be helpful,
but is not mandatory.)
6.1 Intended use. The bags provide an odor barrier for the containment of foodcontaminated
plastic waste in shipboard applications where at-sea disposal of plastics is
prohibited. There are no commercial equivalents that meet all of the physical and mechanical
requirements necessary for this application. In use, filled bags are intended to remain aboard
ship for prolonged periods of time in consonance with naval deployments. Type I bags are to be
used by surface ships for containment of plastic waste processed plastic disks and loose plastic
waste material prior to disposal. Type II bags are for use in submarine compaction units.
6.2 Acquisition requirements. Acquisition documents should specify the following:
a. Title, number, and date of this specification.
b. Bag type and class (see 1.2).
c. Bag size and quantity (see 1.3).
d. Rolls or packaged individual bags.
e. When first article is required (3.1).
f. Packaging requirements (see 5.1).
6.3 First article. The contracting officer should provide specific guidance to offerors
whether the first article samples should be a pre-production item, a first production item, a
sample selected from the first production items or a standard production item from the
MIL-DTL-29597C (NAVY)

contractor’s current inventory (see 3.1 and 4.2). The contracting officer should also include
specific instructions in acquisition documents regarding arrangements for submission of Material
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) prior to contract award, testing, approval of first article test results,
and disposition of first articles. Invitations for bids should provide that the Government reserves
the right to waive requirements for first article inspection to those bidders offering a product,
which has been previously acquired or tested by the Government. Bidders offering such
products, that wish to rely on such production or test, must furnish evidence with the bid that the
prior Government approval is acceptable for the pending contract. Bidders should not submit
alternate bids unless specifically requested to do so in the solicitation.
6.3.1 Prior approval. If a contractor has previously delivered an acceptable product meeting
the requirements of this specification, waiver of the first article inspection requirement (see 4.2)
is at the discretion of the procuring activity for a period of time not to exceed 2 years (see 6.2).
6.3.2 First article sample. The first article sample should be produced using the same plant
facilities intended for the production run. Failure of the first article sample to meet all the
requirements of this specification is cause for rejection.

Subject: Request for Participation in Evaluating Equipment for Detecting Explosive Devices in Unattended Packages by Transit Police Officers

On behalf of the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Science and Technology CounterMeasures Test Beds program (DHS S&T CMTB), Sandia National Laboratories is requesting information concerning commercial or near-commercial hand-held/portable equipment that can be used by Transit Police Officers to investigate unattended items (left behind bags, objects on tracks, etc.) for explosives on commuter rail and light passenger rail (metros and subways) systems.  The Transit Police Officer will employ non-intrusive systems such as portable x-ray, trace detectors, etc. to evaluate unattended items for explosives (TNT, RDX, PETN, Nitro or Ammonia Nitrate base, etc.) that could be used as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in commuter and passenger rail environments. DHS is investigating whether the use of such equipment to evaluate unattended items by Transit Police Officers will decrease incidents where rail stations have to be evacuated and closed awaiting the bomb squad’s investigation.  In order to participate in this evaluation, equipment manufacturers must be willing to loan equipment to the DHS under a no-cost purchase order or similar agreement.  Equipment must be available for evaluation for approximately 8-12 weeks beginning May 1, 2006.  Equipment manufacturers must also be willing to provide technical support and training regarding system operations.
Please submit information in the form of a one-page white paper to:
Linda K. Groves
Sandia National Laboratories
lkgrove@sandia.gov
White papers must include the following information:
• Contact information for system manufacturer
• Physical description of the system (including a picture)
• Operational description of the system (including screening   time, ease of set-up, the procedure and mechanism for detection, ease of operation without continued practice, ability to classify type of explosives)
• Description of system maturity (laboratory prototype versus commercially available product)
• Description of safety measures needed to be taken during device operation to protect Transit Police Operator from object being investigated (i.e. safe stand-off distance).
• Approximate cost per unit and maintenance costs

Pertaining to the above items, the 412th Test Wing (TW), Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement for engineering services to develop a Flight Terminal System Control Panel and a Routing Coputer System.  The development will assist in the further TFS design in order to support High-Alpha Secure Systems and Enhanced Flight Termination Systems.  The procurement is to create a control and communications system linking one or more FTS officers with the FTS transmission and verification equipment used to transmit to launch vehicles.  WV Communications already developed the FTS Encoder/Exciter, Receivers, and HPA systems.  The control panel and routing computer must interact with the encoder/exciter, receivers, and HPA systems already in place, therefore, must be form, fit, and function to the existing equipment.  The services/products being acquired are to upgrade Edwards Air Force Base flight termination system in support of the following programs: X-37 and future Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) Projects. The following are the required specifications:


FLIGHT TERMINATION CONTROL PANEL, COMMUNICATIONS AND ROUTING

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.0	INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Statement of Work is to define the requirements for the services to create a control and communications system linking one or more FTS officers with the FTS transmission and verification equipment used to transmit to launch vehicles.  The system requires two major components, a control panel which collects button and switch state data and sends it to the routing computer, and a routing computer which acknowledges receipt of state information and presents it in proper form to the encoder/exciter and amplifier.  The routing computer also echoes the command state and the verification state data back to the control panel.  Communication between the two is through voice grade analog DSO channels using modem circuitry.  

2.0  REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall perform all tasks required in the Statement of work to produce a FTS Control Panel with Power Key Switch and Carrier Key Switch and a Routing Computer including 16 modems and Ethernet switch with 7 CAT5 Ports and 1 Fiber Port.  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, the contractor is required to prepare and produce associated documentation, i.e., design reviews, TIM’s, electrical, mechanical design, and full documentation of electrical/software I/F.

2.1	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall provide a control panel that contains DPDT switches and two LEDs.  The programming will be firmware written in assembly language with no operating system or file system.  It is to be stored on chip in Flash EEPROM memory and executed directly out of that memory.  The FTS equipment end will consist of four redundant routing computers connected to four FTS equipment chains.  For interfacing to legacy equipment, discrete input and output signals will be handled by solid-state relays.  Outputs will be isolated contact closures or powered (non-isolated) with a voltage source.  Inputs are to isolated voltage or current loads.  For interfacing to FTS encoder/exciter, amplifier and verification receivers, each chain is connected to its own 10/100 ethernet switch.  Each routing computer will connect with two switches and pairs of switches are linked with fiber optic cabling so each router has access to all four equipment chains.  Each routing computer will contain 16 modems to allow it to communicate with up to 16 FTS control panels.

2.2	MEETINGS, REVIEW, CONFERENCES
A system design review shall be held at a mutually agreed upon time and place to review the electrical and mechanical design along with software development.

2.3  DOCUMENTATION
The contractor shall provide full documentation of the control panel mechanical, electrical design as well as software development and support integration documentation.  

NOTE:   Contractor shall provide Hourly Rates, Hours, Extended Cost, Materials, and Subtotals for Electrical Assembly, Mechanical Assembly, Quality Control, Test Technician, CAD Engineer, Program Manager, Senior Engineer, Materials – all per 5 items listed above the Statement of Work. 

Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the items above.   Responses may be sent via e-mail to Terence.vickers@edwards.af.mil or mailed to 412 TW/PKDB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Terence D. Vickers.  Phone Number 661-277-9559 and Fax Number: 661-275-7860.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  If the office has not received any affirmative written responses by Close of Business (COB), 24 April 2006, a Sole Source purchase order will be pursued with WV Communication, Inc., 1176 Tourmaline Drive, Newbury Park, CA 91320.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award sole source.  The Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PR) Edwards AFB, CA intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract for research and testing on Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsequioxanes (POSS) Polyimides to ITN Energy Systems Inc., 8130 Shaffer Parkway, Littleton, CO, 80127.  Preliminary studies show that polyimides with incorporated nanostructured Si-O frameworks known as POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes) have significantly extended usable lifetimes in simulated Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) environments.  In fact, after simulated LEO exposure, erosion yields of 10 and 20 weight % POSS Polyimide samples were 3.7 and 0.98 percent, respectively, of the erosion yield for state of the art Kapton H polyimide at a fluence of 8.5 x 1020 O atoms cm-2. POSS offers major advantages over conventional filler technology such as significantly improved oxidation resistance, enhanced compatibilization throughout the polymer matrix, increased modulus and temperature stability, reduced thermal expansion coefficients, and lower densities.  Our focus is for using these materials in specific DoD applications for space structures.

Access to Restricted Technical Information:  Restricted technical information is available to qualified offerors and will be provided upon request from the Technical POC.  Only U.S. Contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose may have access to this information.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the data. 

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Sources that believe they have the capability under this requirement may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified Government point of contact no later than 1:00 p.m. local time, on 20 Jan 2005.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  If you have any specific questions, please email the Contract Negotiator at marc.venzon@edwards.af.mil. Note 22 applies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a size standard of 1,000.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.
INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.
Humanitarian Protection and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Specialist RATS

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-06-10420, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-07.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $10.0 million to qualify as a small  business, is applicable.  A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 firm, fixed-price contracts are anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the assessment of a test method protocol employing surface enhanced laser desorption and ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) of plasma proteins as a means to screen chemicals for estrogenic activity.  The Government contemplates executing a round-robin (ring test) with participation from a minimum of three (3) and maximum of seven (7) contract laboratories. This round-robin approach is a critical step in achieving the Government?s need for evaluating the performance of the test method protocol as it relates to correctly classifying samples as estrogenic or non-estrogenic. The successful contractors shall have proven experience in  SELDI-TOF MS or matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as well as direct access to an instrument capable of analyzing Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc?s. (Fremont,CA) proprietary ProteinChip? arrays.  The government will supply the specific test method protocol to be used in the analysis of supplied samples (Appendix 1).  A positive (estrogen-treated) fish plasma sample and a neutral (control) fish plasma sample will be provided for an initial demonstration of analyst capability. Ten (10) neutral (control) fish plasma samples will be provided to establish normal reference protein response ranges and limits by the contractor. In addition, twenty-seven (27) fish plasma sample ?unknowns? furnished with code numbers will be provided for analysis and interpretation.   A normalization standard (salmon plasma) will be provided.  Protein masses (m/z) to be used as estrogen responsive biomarkers will be provided.  A quality assurance / quality control program shall be in place and approved by EPA prior to performance at the contractor?s laboratory and shall address, at a minimum, the following topics:  sample storage; instrument calibration, accuracy and precision; physical processing of samples; and data reporting. Again, the contractor(s) shall submit a copy of their quality assurance/quality control protocols to the EPA Project Officer prior to analysis of samples.  Contractors shall supply all equipment, software, supplies, reagents and standards with the exception of those provided for by the Government.  The contractor(s) shall be required to prepare and analyze  all plasma samples provided for this evaluation following the specific analytical procedures supplied in Appendix 1. (See the EPA Procurement website http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.)  This includes a demonstration of analyst capability as described in Section 15 of the protocol (Appendix 1). Upon receipt by the contractor(s), all samples must be maintained at -70?C until analysis. Analysis shall be conducted using weak cation exchange (CM10) ProteinChip arrays. Prepared ProteinChip arrays are to be analyzed using a Ciphergen SELDI Protein Chip Reader and the spectral data acquired using Ciphergen Biosystems ProteinChip software complete with Biomarker Wizard software. Analysis of raw data including mass calibration, baseline subtraction, total ion current normalization and peak cluster detection should  be performed using Ciphergen ProteinChip software complete with Biomarker Wizard software. The contractor(s) shall provide all files listed in Section 14.10 of the attached protocol in an electronic format using Ciphergen ProteinChip software for spectral results and Microsoft EXCEL for significance calculations. A report containing the demonstration of analyst capability, and a written evaluation and interpretation of the data analysis and detailing the classification of the twenty-seven (27) unknown coded plasma samples as matching ?estrogen-responsive? or ?non-estrogenic? profiles shall be provided as deliverables. All results of QA measures shall also be provided as a deliverable including laboratory notes discussing problems encountered as an appendix to the final report. Original records such as laboratory notebooks  and printouts from analytical devices shall be retained by the contractor for at least three (3) years following the submission of the final report, as they may be requested by EPA.  Results shall be reported to the EPA Project Officer no later than 90 days after contract award.  The contractor(s) shall provide a price for analysis and reporting of thirty-nine (39) samples (one (1) positive and ten (11) neutral samples plus twenty-seven (27) unknown samples) including all QA requirements and including the cost of shipping the samples from Gulf Breeze, Florida to the contractor?s analytical facility.

This acquisition is for Brand Name or Equal items only and is a 100% small business set aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (the award will be less than $100,000) will be followed. 

The Brand Name or Equal purchase will be for the following items: (Qty 2 each). Due to jump requirements Test Parachutist Program at the AFFTC, this container/canopy will be used to perform Advanced Free fall maneuvers; Test Parachutists upgrade jumps, water jumps, test, and evaluation applications. 

The Test Parachutist Program requires the use of QAC, HX-600 Canopy (Orange) w Cypress Ready Option, quantity five each, due to jump requirements here at the AFFTC.  This canopy/container is used to perform Advanced Free fall Maneuvers; Test Parachutists upgrade jumps, Water jumps and test applications. The purpose of replacing existing canopy/container is due to service life; the existing systems that are currently being used were purchased in the late 70’s, exceed their shelf life, and the manufacture no longer supports the equipment.  

The justification for a Brand Name or Equal Purchase; Butler Personnel Parachute System, LLC is the only manufacturer of this canopy/container. When purchased straight from the manufacturer the wait time is 8-10 weeks and the time factor is the most important element in regards of replacing current harness/containers.  The QAC, HX-600/container is the safest container on the market to date and due to the test applications used here at the AFFTC safety is paramount. Due to our current parachute systems exceeding their shelf life the timeliness of receiving the new QAC, HX-600/container systems could result in mission stoppage.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 2006-03-21.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3812 and the size standard is 750 employees.  NAICS is 334511.
This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (the award will be less than $100,000) will be followed.  

This purchase will be for The ABS-400 is a programmable airborne telemetry bit synchronizer designed specifically for command and control applications in the severe environment of tactical aircraft.  The basic system consists of a Base Module containing a 30-W power supply and one BSM-410 bit synchronizer.  One additional BSM-410 bit synchronizer is also added in order to form a dual bit synchronizer assembly, each unit operating independently.  Set-up and control are performed via Windows based programming circuitry.  Bit synchronizer lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.  Loss of receiver input signal will cause the bit synchronizer to clamp the operating data rate to the pre-programmed rate.  Programming is accomplished via an integral RS-232 port with programmable variables including: Bits/Word, Words/Frame, Sync Pattern, Sync Correlation, Sync Lock Strategy and Sync Loss Strategy.  

ABS-400/BSM-410 specifications include: Standard IRIG code formats of NRZ-L, NRZ-M, NRZ-S, RNRZ-L, Bi-phase-L, Bi-phase-M and Bi-phase-S.

Bit Rates range from 100 bps to 10 Mbps for NRZ codes and from 100 bps to 5 Mbps for Bi-phase codes.

PCM data input requires single-ended signal with less than +/- 20% jitter and up to 50% of signal amplitude.  Input impedance can be 50 Ohms or 1 M Ohm with less than 50 pf nominal.  Usable input range is 100 mV p/p through 10 V p/p.  Digital output data and clock is RS-422.

Bit Synchronizer functions include filter and sample detector, programmable loop bandwidths of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.8% or 1.6%, a tuning resolution of 0.1%, tracking range of 3 times loop bandwidth, a capture range of 3 times loop bandwidth, a minimum capture SNR of 12 dB, a bit error rate of less than 1dB from theoretical at 1.0 Mbps NRZ-L, run lengths of up to 100 symbols, clock jitter of less than 0.5% at 12 dB Eb/No, and a lock time of less than 100 symbols for NRZ data and less than 50 symbols for Bi-phase data at 12 dB Eb/No.

Input power requirement is 28 Vdc +/- 6 V with a nominal input current of 480 mA.  Over-voltage tolerance is 40 V.  The system meets the EMI specification of MIL-STD-461C, 462.

The unit’s physical size is 2.5” X 3.5” X 2” with a weight not to exceed 17 oz.  Individual modules will be stacked vertically with the Base Module/Power Supply at the bottom and in contact with the mounting pallet or shelf for best heat dissipation.  Additional modules will be stacked vertically above the Base Module.   

The environmental characteristics include an operating temperature range of –40C to +85C with a storage range from –54C to +125C.  Sinusoidal vibration range is 10g from 50 to 2000Hz and random vibration is 20g from 20 to 2000Hz.  Shock specification is 275g half sine for 1.0 mS while operating humidity is from 1% to 98% relative.

These units must be in exact form, fit, and function of what is currently being used for the F-16 aircraft.  They must be identical to pre-existing hardware to save aircraft mod cost and time.
Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the items described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete quote including delivery FOB destination Edwards AFB CA 93524.  Delivery will be 180 days ARO.  Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.

An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted. Wherever the words 'offer', 'proposal', 'offerors', or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean 'quote', 'quotation', 'quoter', 'vendor' or similar corresponding term to eflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.11 1-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition. Local clause 52.111-4131 states: 'Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice. Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Acces s Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Veh icle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weeken ds (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays. On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5). Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visi tor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by drivin g through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate gua rd as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 feet-5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. 'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet-5 inches  in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the  procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie o r Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate. All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast acces s identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate. The con tractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes. (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.' Local clause 52.111-4132 states: 'a. Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast a ccess identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week. Contractor employees,  at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logisti cs Center Gate is closed). The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program. The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program. b. The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to ha ve access to Fort Lewis. The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card. If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will  be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor e mployee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast ac cess identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall imme diately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day. An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitor s pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract. The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor. Any such changes s hall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract. d. Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees. If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstance s to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e. Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract. The iden tification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s). The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued. f. The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 o r FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g. If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.' ADDENDUM TO CLAUSES 52.111-4131 and 52.111-4132: Employees who require access to Fort Lewis to perform work under this contract may obtain a Government s ponsored identification badge. The identification card process has been contracted out and the cost of the identification card shall be borne by the contractor.

<DESC>*****This information is in addition to information provided in previous announcements for this requirement.******

Some general questions were received in regards to the Government’s needs and how we plan on using the equipment.  The following provides more information on how the Government intends to use the equipment:

The unit will be used in a non-production facility.  High speed scanning is not high priority.  The material systems (specimens) to be analyzed include the full spectrum.  We perform basic failure analysis and research on all aircraft materials.  This includes Ti, Al, Fe alloys, super alloys, ceramics, and composites to name a few.  In essence, we want a system that can analyze all types of materials with minimum reconfiguration between specimens.  The system will not have a dedicated technician to run the equipment.  The Navy is interested in a unit that is easily operated.  
 
    The specimen geometry may be flat or curved such as a turbine blade.  We want to identify small imperfections that may be on a curved sections of a turbine with micro diffraction.  Therefore it is required that rough and irregular shaped samples are to be analyzed.
 
     XRD new system Training includes both software and hardware.  Training includes hands on training of the purchased unit at NAVAIR for familiarization purposes.   Advanced training on the software packages may be performed at either NAVAIR Pax River or the vendor site if within the United States.  It is expected that the vendor training include familiarization with the software packages supplied with the unit.  The hardware training/ familiarization should be performed at NAVAIR.  The duration of the training will be determined and highlighted by the vendor in the proposal.
 
    Reference Standard/s will be supplied to NAVAIR if required for any of the software analysis packages.  NAVAIR is requesting both quantitative and qualitative analysis capabilities for this unit.  Some manufactures may supply a standard reference that is periodically run on the equipment to determine beam performance.  If the vendor can perform these tasks without a standard, then it is not required.
 
    NAVAIR is not directing the kind/type of robust advanced quantitative analysis package.  
 
    The stage requirements may include tilting if needed for analyzing rough irregular shaped specimens.  The pinning requirement is to analyzed the irregulars shaped specimens.  The +/- 50mm Z direction requirement may be removed as a specific requirement.
 
    The location or the type of the collimator kit for this unit is not specified.

In addition to this general information, the following is also provided:

Item 10, (Cu absorber for CU- and Mo- radiation) is deleted.

In regards to Item 14, (Cu secondary monochromator for operation with Theta/Theta or Theta 2 Theta) we want a monochromator/s for analysis during micro diffraction as well as general diffraction applications.  This includes examining unknown specimens approximately 1cm by 1cm that may include Fe.  If the vendor has a technology that can replace a monochromater with a different device that exhibits similar or better characteristics of a monochromator, the government will consider the option. Otherwise, as a minimum we should have monochromator/s for a point detector and 1D detector.

In regards to Item 11a, a computer controlled stage is required.

Item 11c (minimum displacement of +/- 50 mm in Z direction is deleted.

The response date is still April 19th at 1400 EST.  The estimated award date is the middle of May.  If faxing your proposal, please call to ensure that your fax was received.

Part 1-STATEMENT OF WORK -
MEDICAL REVIEW OFFICER SERVICES

C.1. Introduction

The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is the nation’s primary producer of currency.  We operate in two locations:  Washington, DC, and Fort Worth, TX.  BEP employs approximately 2,340 employees (1,650 in Washington and 690 in Fort Worth).  The BEP is dedicated to ensuring the eradication and deterrence of drug abuse among its employees at both facilities.  The major objective of this statement of work (SOW) is to obtain Medical Review Officer (MRO) services.  These services are required to expedite the administration of the BEP Drug-Free Federal Workplace Program in an effective and efficient manner.  In accordance with Executive Order 12564, BEP established the Drug-Free Federal Workplace Program (DFFWP) in 1989.  The DFFWP implemented by BEP is based on the scientific and technical guidelines issued by the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Personnel Management.  The BEP’s random testing pool includes approximately 1,800 employees.

Background

The BEP DFFWP is effective for all employment applicants, and for positions designated as a Testing Designated Position (TDP).  TDPs are designated for random drug testing because they required the highest degree of trust and confidence.  Employees in TDPs subject to random drug testing include:

*	Employees in the Senior Executive Service;
*	Employees authorized to carry or have access to firearms;
*	Employees who operated fork lifts and other materials handling machinery; and
*	Other identified positions requiring the protection of life and property, public health or safety, and other positions requiring a high degree of trust and confidence.

The BEP Drug Testing Program includes the following types of drug testing:

*	Applicant Testing (Pre-Employment);
*	Random Testing of employees occupying TDPs;
*	Reasonable Suspicion Testing;
*	Voluntary Testing;
*	Unsafe Practices/Post-Accident Testing; and
*	Follow-Up (including Return to Duty) testing.
