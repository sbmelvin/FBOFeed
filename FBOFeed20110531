Project/Program Name (and Program Element, if applicable):  Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS)  Estimated Contract Cost (including options):  $211,040.22Type Program:  Other ContractingAuthority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by                     FAR 6.302-1(c)Type J&A:  Individual, Brand Name Specific

AFPEO/ELS ESC/HGGK, located at Maxwell Air Force Base (AFB)-Gunter Annex, is the contracting office for this requirement for hardware support for the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) Program.  This document constitutes a "Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition" for hardware for the CMOS application described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).
ESC/HGGK and ESC/HGGJ propose to execute an award to Savi Technology for hardware described herein as a firm-fixed price contract.  This individual Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is to issue a new delivery order.  
The supplies to be acquired are: 168 each Tyco Electronics Transponder Hardwire Electrical Interface Cable (USB); 168 each Data Cables for the Savi Tag 654; and 179 each Savi Mobile Reader 650 with DB-9 Connector with a 9 inch Cable.In addition, these items are peculiar to one manufacturer.  A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer.  This brand name justification is based on the fact that the CMOS Program Management Office (PMO) has developed customized software that is specific to the SaviTag hardware configurations.  This brand name justification is also based on the fact that the CMOS PMO requires the SaviTag Docking Station with accessories to support the field users that have currently began using CMOS.  This hardware will be used to implement CMOS for the incoming and outgoing cargo all over the world by the Air Force, Air National Guard, Army, NSA, Navy and the USMC.  The SaviTag hardware is used widely with the war efforts in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan; as well as peace efforts at the respective Air Force Bases.  CMOS uses SaviTag hardware products that contain trade secrets and are totally unique solutions in the Informat! ion Technology marketplace.  Savi Technology is the manufacturer and holder of all proprietary software and codes for the SaviTag products.  Failure to acquire the SaviTag product will result in CMOS Mission Failure.  Because of the propriety nature of the SaviTag Docking Station with Client Tools and the accessories, this hardware is only available through Savi Technology.This contract order is for supplies/services that will not require a Statement of Work.  The requirement for the new hardware from Savi Technology will be posted to Hanscom's Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Government will include the statement that it intends to award this requirement to Savi Technology as a sole source acquisition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c) as the hardware is proprietary to Savi Technology. 
All interested vendors will be given the opportunity to submit a quote based on lowest price.  All quotes received will be considered and evaluated equally.  The Contracting Officer has determined the anticipated cost to the Government of the acquisition covered by this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be fair and reasonable.  In addition, the Contracting Officer will review market prices, previous or current similar contracts and verify that the prices proposed are fair and reasonable and will be beneficial on behalf of the Government.

AFPEO/ELS ESC/HGGK, located at Maxwell Air Force Base (AFB)-Gunter Annex, is the contracting office for the requirement described herein.  This individual Justification and Approval is to issue a new delivery order on a firm fixed price basis.  ESC/HGGK and ESC/HGGJ, located at Maxwell Air Force Base (AFB)-Gunter Annex propose to purchase nine (9) Intermec Model CK61GB Handheld Terminals with accessories and a three year (3) Service Contract plan for maintenance and technical support of the requested items.  It will be executed on behalf of ESC-HGGJ/Installations and Logistics Systems (IL) in support of the Cargo Movement Operations System listed in paragraph III of this document. 
ESC/HGGJ requests to purchase hardware for the development and testing of CMOS for the Air Force, Air National Guard, Army, National Security Agency (NSA), Navy and the Unites States Marine Corp (USMC).  The descriptions of the items to be purchased are as follows:  Nine (9) Intermec Model CK61GB Handheld Terminals (HHT) (maintenance and technical support), nine (9) SCR license, and nine (9) Scan Handle and Trigger. 
CK61GB Handheld Terminals will be required to upgrade their HHTs to which the CMOS software code is written.  CMOS software is specifically written to be compatible with this particular HHT and the latest release requires the necessary upgrade.  As it stands today, CMOS is hand-written in PRO*C and C++ languages code and the interface (use) of specific HHTs is written in the code.  Other brand HHTs are incompatible with the underlying CMOS source code and modification of the current CMOS code would be required to support a different brand HHT.  In addition, CMOS uses Intermec hardware products which contains trade secrets and are totally unique solutions in the Information Technology marketplace.  Intermec is the manufacturer and holder of all proprietary hardware for their products.  This hardware is the latest version of Intermec CK61GB Handheld Terminal and will replace all existing models in the field that are supported by the manufacturer.  The CMOS PMO is required to s! upport hardware equipment purchases that are used by the Field Users for technical support and technical refresh.  The current users are familiar with the Intermec CK61GB Handheld Terminals and new users are being trained in the field to use the Intermec CK61GB Handheld Terminals.  Failure to purchase the requested Intermec brand name products will result in CMOS Mission Failure with the Air Force, Air National Guard, Army, NSA, Navy and the USMC.  The Intermec CK61 was first sold to the CMOS PMO back in 2008 as a replacement to the Intermec 751g product.  It was sold off of the AIT-III contract.  The CMOS PMO continued to use the AIT-III contract to source their CK61s until the contract expired in July 2009.  At which time, Intermec moved the CK61 to their GSA schedule (70IT Schedule # GS-35F-0511T).  CMOS used this purchase vehicle to source their computers up to and including their most recent purchase in January 2011.  The CK61 is being retired by Intermec.  Not related!  to this product announcement, Intermec has had an on-going project to reconfigure its GSA schedule to better meet customers' future needs.  During this process, the CK61 was removed from the GSA schedule because it will not be available for sale much longer.  The CK61 is still available for sale directly through Intermec until the parts run out; all efforts will be made to keep customer costs stable.  Intermec intends to sell the CK61 through September 2011, but that could change based on customer demands.  The product will only be available until the parts supply is exhausted.  The Government currently has parts to build a few hundred units.  Of course, the Government maintains ability to support fielded devices for several years after retirement.  	 A request for quote will be issued via Hanscom's Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) with the justification for the requested "Brand Name Specific" items allowing all vendors a fair opportunity to provide a response for the requested products and services; which will establish competition.  The Government will include the statement that it intends to award this requirement to Intermec Technologies Corporation, as a sole source acquisition in accordance with FAR 6.302(1)(c), as the hardware is proprietary to Intermec Technologies Corporation.  All interested vendors will be given the opportunity to submit a quote based on lowest price.  All quotes received will be considered and evaluated equally.  The evaluation of this effort will be conducted using experienced technical representative and contracting personnel.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR the AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ADVANCED RESEARCH SIMULATOR (ATCARS) UPGRADE.
NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED OR EMAILED.
This is a market survey for the ATCARS upgrade.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition, or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the ATCARS upgrade.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1.  Capability Statement - This document should identify

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONfor SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)

Date:  5/31/11                                       PR Number: R1574110062

1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):Two units- portable traffic signals. Solar powered. Delivery and setup will be $750.00 each.  Rental for both units is $5,750.00 per month.  The Make of the traffic signals is Horizon and the Model is SQ3.  Supply lights with micro terminal, 3 extra lights and 1 controller.  Lights are supplied with solar panels and will be programmed at time of delivery.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
______	Only one responsible source. ____x__	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. 
Explain:  An emergency situation occurred. A road slide failure on the East Entrance road narrowed the road to a single lane. The road was unsafe for travel and was closed. This road closure severely impacted government operations. Services to the public was greatly impacted. Businesses inside the park and in gateway communities such as Cody, Wyoming and government gate receipts and fees were greatly impacted. Flagging could not be done on a 24 hour basis. These portable traffic lights are needed on a temporary basis to control traffic through this one lane area so that the road can be reopened. The road was closed until this traffic light was set up and operational. The slide became severe on Saturday, May 14. It was not possible to contact suppliers until Monday, May 16. Delivery and setup needed to occur as soon as possible, no later than Wednesday May 18.  The repair will require months to design and construct. In order to meet the delivery deadline a short term purchase was arranged and is being continued until Yellowstone National Park can purchase this equipment. This emergency limited the number of companies to those who could respond and meet the deadline.  Many sources were contacted and it was determined that it was in the best interest of the Government to purchase these units. The time to process this bid, award and deliver will necessitate that these rental services be provided on an emergency basis until the delivery of the new equipment is made.
 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:Several contracts for major road work have been administered by the Federal Highway Administration over the last 25 years in Yellowstone National Park. Our market research included contacting FHWA to identify sources for this immediate need. They identified Highway Technologies from Missoula, MT as the most responsive source. Another firm, United Rentals had been used in the past but this company has since been bought out by Highway Technologies.Also, CCR was used to locate contractors in the local area that might provide these units for rental, however when these companies were contacted they were not able to meet our immediate need. A short term rental agreement was necessary to buy enough time to fill the immediate need until the equipment can be purchased.__________________________________________________________________
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to enter into negotiations for a QTY of 1 each Fiber Placement Machine. The Contractor shall be responsible for design, manufacture, and delivery of a multi-axis 4-tow fiber placement machine capable of placing thermosetting resins with fiber to the Composites Lab (the Lab) at NAWCWD China Lake, CA. The Contractor shall oversee installation and setup of the fiber placement machine in the Lab, develop and implement checkout procedures to verify the capability of the machine after installation. The contractor will also train Lab personnel for 1 week minimum at NAWCWD in the proper use of the machine  to include safety, programming and hardware operation and furnish complete documentation including instruction manuals for the hardware and software, electrical wiring diagrams, mechanical interface drawings and applicable maintenance manuals.
 The machine must be capable of handling diameters from 1 inch up to 48 inches, flat surfaces, and concave and convex contours. Part length varies from 1 foot up to 10 feet. The machine shall accommodate tooling and parts up to 6000 lb total. It must be capable of handling most commercially available ATL-grade thermosetting resin and fiber systems, including fiberglass, graphite, Kevlar, epoxy, cyanate ester, bismaleimide, and polyimide. These materials may be in slit tape or tow-preg format in 0.250" tow/tape width. The head of the machine shall have a provision for being interchangeable to allow for use of other materials such as thermoplastics and phenolic tapes. The machine must have enough axes of motion to allow for fiber to be placed between 0 degree and 90 degree orientation to the longitudinal axis of the machine.
 The angle shall be adjustable in 1.0 degree increments at a minimum. The tows must be placed accurately with a tolerance of plus or minus 0.1 degree. The machine must be capable of mid-path fiber steering. The placement head shall be capable of independently feeding and placing up to 4 tows/tapes. The head must be capable of placing material as short as 2.0" in length, up to the entire length of the part (10 feet). The machines must use compaction to help hold the fibers in place with a compaction roller on the head capable of applying up to 200 lb to the part. The machine must have a provision for maintaining some tension on the fiber creels so that fouling of the fiber is avoided. The machine must have a method for tacking in place the composite material.
 The material does not need to be cured in place, but must hold shape through construction and transfer to an oven or autoclave. The machine must fit into a footprint of 20 feet long by 15 feet deep by 15 feet high. The existing facilities have electrical power available up to 200 Amp 480 VAC/ 3 phase, as well as compressed air at approx. 100 psi maximum and aprox. 500L/minute.
 
The fiber placement machine shall include all control hardware and software. There are two essential pieces of software to be included with the system. First, there must be software to control the fiber placement hardware. The machine shall automatically control material feed rate, compaction roller pressure, quantity of tows, fiber angles, fiber lengths, tacking heat temperature, and machine axis speeds.
 Software to model fiber placement on the tool / mandrel is also required. The machine must have a method to either generate a model of the part and tool or accept standard CAD/CAM files of parts and tools. The software shall also provide an optimized layup schedule to reduce excessive buildups and minimize gaps. These models must be accurately transferred to the machine control software to maintain the layup pattern. The machine must have interfaces and controls for the operator. There shall be controls for axes, feed rates, tack temperature, compaction pressure, machine speed, and tow enable/disable. There shall also be a display on the machine to show the operator what the machine is doing.
 The display shall show in real time axial positions, estimated layer completion time, tack temperature, material feed rate, machine speed, compaction load and warnings/errors. There shall be manual control buttons to move axes of the machine outside of a software program running. The machine shall have hard or soft stops to prevent the head from crashing into any part of the frame. There shall also be soft stops to prevent the head from crashing into the tool/part. There must be emergency stops (E-stops) available for an operator to stop the machine from critical locations around the machine. These E-stops shall lock all axes, disable the tacking heat and compaction roller, shut out power to the head and turning chuck and bleed off air pressure.

<DESC>This is the Naval Inventory Control Point synopsis for the solicitation of a Basic Ordering Agreement for the repair of multiple NSN's used in support of the JTIDS E-2C system. Data Link Solutions L.L.C. (081U3) is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. The following are the top 3 high dollar value items for repair: Processor Group, SIG/ NSN 7RE 5865 014437394 AJ/ P/N K310A106-20/  Amplifier, Radio FRE/ NSN 7RH 5996 014385802 AJ/ P/N K310A104-21/ Interface Unit, COM/ NSN 7RH 5895 014464756 EX/ P/N A405A131-70. For a complete list of all items to be repaired or any questions concerning this notice, contact Brett Murphy 215-697-3563.

The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award because the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the U.S. Naval Inventory Control Point Source Approval Information Brochure which can be found at www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. Questions on this brochure should be directed to the Source Development Department by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-5985.
  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>PREP Multi-Component Evaluation
<SOLNBR>11-233-SOL-00206
<CONTACT>Camille M. Timmerman, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014436851, Email camille.timmerman@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>The proposed acquisition listed herein is unrestricted. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) and the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of HHS for the multi-component evaluation of the State grant portion of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) authorized by Section 2953 of the Patient Prevention and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The RFP number is 11-233-SOL-00206. The NAICS code is 541611</p>
<p>PREP is one of multiple efforts at the Federal level to reduce teen pregnancy through the use of evidence-based practices. The program provides $55.25 million in formula grants to States to "replicate evidence-based effective program models or substantially incorporate elements of effective programs that have been proven on the basis of rigorous scientific research to change behavior, which means delaying sexual activity, increasing condom or contraceptive use for sexually active youth, or reducing pregnancy among youth." More information on the program can be found here: <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb/content/programs/tpp.htm">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb/content/programs/tpp.htm</a></p>
<p>The goal of the PREP Multi-Component Evaluation will be to document how programs funded through the State PREP program are implemented in the field and to assess selected PREP-funded programs' effectiveness. The evaluation is expected to include three primary, interconnected components, or "studies": (1) a broad descriptive analysis of how States designed and implemented PREP programs, (2) the collection and analysis of performance management data, and (3) impact and in-depth implementation evaluations of four to five specific PREP-funded sites. Below is a description of each of these components:</p>
<p>1.) Design and Implementation Study: A survey of how States designed and implemented PREP programs. Using multiple methods of information collection, including surveys that may be conducted with all states operating PREP programs, the study would document the general design and implementation of PREP State grant programs. Among other information, ACF is interested in the following: how States and/or sub-awardees elected to replicate evidence-based effective programs or substantially incorporate elements of effective programs; how States and/or sub-awardees placed substantial emphasis on both abstinence and contraception; and how States and/or sub-awardees addressed the required adulthood preparation subjects.</p>
<p>2.) Performance Analysis Study: Creation of a system to monitor grantee performance and analysis of performance data. The contractor would develop performance measurement instruments and set up a system for tracking performance, including integrating the system with ACF's On-Line Data Collection (OLDC) system and providing training and technical assistance to reporting agencies. The contractor would use the system to quarterly and annually report on State PREP performance outcomes, in order to determine if PREP grantees (i.e. States and sub-awardees) are meeting performance benchmarks related to the program's mission and priorities.</p>
<p>3.) Impact and Implementation Study: An impact and in-depth, high-quality implementation evaluation of a select number of PREP-funded programs. Using an experimental design in approximately 4 to 5 sites, with an average of approximately 1,500 research sample members at each site, this study would test the effectiveness of a range of PREP program models to impact behavior and related outcomes. The impact evaluation is expected to involve a baseline survey and two follow-up surveys (e.g. a short-term follow-up survey at 6 months post-program and a long-term follow-up survey at some point between 12 and 24 months post-program). A critical component of this impact evaluation will be an in-depth, high-quality implementation data collection and analysis effort of each site evaluated. In addition to measures of fidelity (e.g., adherence, exposure/dosage, quality of service delivery, participant response), this in-depth analysis would document how specific programs implemented key components of the PREP programs (e.g., substantially incorporating elements of effective programs, placing substantial emphasis on abstinence and contraception, and addressing adulthood preparation subjects).</p>
<p>The evaluation - which is expected to be a seven-year effort - will make a significant contribution to the teen pregnancy prevention evidence base and literature.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.The closing date will be approximately 60 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) requests information on existing full vehicle blast mitigation capabilities currently available to protect Light Tactical Vehicle occupants from Objective (O) MRAP level underbody threats.  The most important technical considerations will focus on existing full vehicle level blast mitigating systems (as opposed to individual systems), which may include but are not limited to, underbody shaping, cab stiffness, energy absorbing interior crew floor, blast mitigating seats, and any other existing mitigating technologies.  This RFI is exclusively interested in existing full vehicle designs that are available to start comparative testing by 25 July 2011.  The government intends to enter into multiple appropriate Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to quantify the effectiveness of existing vehicle level blast mitigation strategies and for compilation of data and comparison of approaches.  Blast mitigation strategies submitted will be compared with respect to the level of mitigation of occupant injuries as rated against the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), Dynamic Response Index (DRI), Revised Tibia Index (RTI), and blunt trauma injury criteria.  The overall program objective is to gain knowledge for comparative analysis of blast injury mitigation for vehicle level strategies, for potential consideration in current and future programs.

This helmet is intended to be utilized by open ocean boat drivers and their crew.  This helmet, and its user, will be subjected to significant vibration and shock over extended periods of time.  The helmet, and its user, will also be subjected to various extremes of temperature and exposure to sea water spray and splashes.  <br>The AMMCH helmet requirements consist of, but are not limited to the following (the requirements are listed in relative order of importance):<br>Weight:  Keep the helmet system as light as possible while still meeting other desired features.<br>Comfort:  Users will be required to wear the helmet for long periods of time under various environmental conditions.  <br>Stability:  Must offer excellent stability while maintaining comfort when worn with Night Vision Devices (mounted to helmet).<br>Communications:  It is desired to have the communications capability integrated into the helmet system.  Other desired features include:  1. noise cancellation capability.  2. Noise localization capability.  3. Compatible with existing platform system.  4. Wireless to allow operator freedom of movement on the platform.  5. All components must have water proof features to ensure operation during wet conditions, i.e., rain, splashing, submerged for short periods (30 seconds).  6. Components easily accessible for repair and replacement.<br>Penetration Resistance:  Helmet must offer some level of resistance to penetration.<br>Bump Protection:  Helmet must offer some level of bump protection. <br>Quick Drying:  Helmet should maximize use of hydrophobic materials to maximize the ability of the helmet to quickly dry.  Components may be removable to improve dry time.<br>Compatibility:  Helmet shall be compatible with and capable of securely mounting Night Vision Devices, operate with protective eyewear, etc.<br>Low Profile:  Helmet should maintain as low a profile as practical while still meeting as many requirements as possible.  Helmet design should maximize peripheral vision, side to side and up - down.  It is expected that the helmet geometry will approximate a   shell type.<br>Environmental:  Helmet should be capable of maintaining function and performance under various military environmental extremes.<br>Multiple Sizes:  Multiple sizes are desirable to maximize comfort and stability.<br>Mandible Protection:  It is desired to have the capability to have a modular, removable mandible protection.   The mandible shall minimize the impact on peripheral vision.<br>Head and Neck Support:  It is desired to have the ability to provide fore and aft head restraint to minimize torque on head during prolonged shock and vibration environment.  If this feature is incorporated it must be quickly removable and not be too cumbersome to the operator such that it prevents the conduct of his mission.  It is desired that this feature not require the user to be physically connected to the boat and must allow the user freedom of movement on the platform.<br>Optional Accessories:  May provide the ability to mount lights.<br><br>Interested sources must, within 30 days, of the publication of this RFI, respond with information on their product/technology.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is seeking sources for a multi-channel signal data recorder for use with its Carry on Equipment (COE) program. Today up to five IF inputs as well as diverse ancillary inputs must be addressed.  The architecture must be open for future expansion of bandwidths and/or transition to alternative IF frequencies as well as possible increase in the total number of data inputs.  Future upgrades could include the need for coherent files produced for the multiple input streams.  
A commercial off the shelf system is preferred, though not required. The recording solution must meet the following criteria:
1) Personnel-  The recording solution will be operated, installed, and maintained by military personnel; 
2) Interfaces- The recorder solution must interface with the host COE.  The recorder must permit remote control of all recorder functions via an operator/maintenance graphical user interface(GUI).  The GUI must be written in a language permitting it to operate with multiple computer operating systems; 
3)Data storage format and form- the final file format must be in Platinum data format.  The specification for the Platinum format will be provided as a part of the RFP package should an RFP be issued. The final storage solution is required to be economical, transportable and reliable; 
4)Equipment protection- the final recorder solution requires a transport case protecting it from potential damage during its transport/install/de-install life; 
5)Data feeds -today's system has six 160 MHz IF channels at 80 MHz bandwidth available for recording. The system can be reconfigured to provide four 1 GHz IF channels at 500 MHz bandwidth. Future systems may use these IF values but the number of available channels may increase; 
6)Ancillary feeds - One 1-PPS timing feed; one time code input; up to four video feeds. Additional ancillary feeds may be required of future systems; 
7)  Voice input - One physically and electronically isolated voice input channel and associated storage; 
8)Storage/Transport Environment - The recorder solution will be a part of a larger equipment suite used by the COE program.  These suites of equipment are stored in government facilities.  When ordered by management, install teams bundle a set of equipment for shipping to the install location.  The recorder solution will be part of a set of equipment which may get palletized and moved by forklift.  Transport is often not palletized; equipment is in its transport case but experiences heavy shock/vibration as it transits an industrial complex.  Equipment is moved by government pick up truck, commercial carrier (semi trailer), or rail.  Install often requires handling in areas where a dropped case may occur.
9) Operating Environment- The recorder must be 19-inch rack mountable and may be exposed to high heat and high humidity conditions; 10)BIT Testing-It is desired that the recorder be capable of built-in testing for vendor engineered components.
This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request For Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant contract.  This request is for information only and is intended to identify items currently available or companies capable of providing the required system.  When responding, please reference sources sought announcement number N00178-10-Q-1909.  Provide the company name, point of contact, telephone and fax numbers, internet address, business size, and specific information regarding your capabilities.  Interested parties shall provide their capabilities and related experience by submitting a White Paper no later than 8 May 2010.  Papers should be submitted electronically to crystal.breen@navy.mil.  ONLY UNCLASSIFED information shall be submitted.  Proprietary information not releasable to the public domain may be submitted and will be properly safeguarded.  Any proprietary information contained in a submittal shall be clearly marked throughout with the appropriate handling and distribution markings, by the respondent.  Responses should indicated how your company can satisfy the requirements listed above and shall not exceed 10 pages in length.

<a href="mailto:tiffany.s.brooks@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Fort Worth</a>
<DESC><br>UPDATED 19 MAY 2011<br><br>Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC)<br>Request for Information (RFI)<br><br>Closing Date: 14 June 2011<br><br>Synopsis:<br>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Instrumentation Management Office (IMO), as the materiel developer for the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), is seeking industry information on available products, technologies and construction methods to further define and refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC).  Request for information responses may address available products, technologies and methods to represent an urban environment.  PM ITTS is the lead for the acquisition of this capability.   <br><br>Background:<br>The US military has an immediate need for a robust Joint Urban Operations (JUO) testing capability to support both developmental and operational testing. The JUTC will consist of a live urban environment, a virtual/ constructive urban environment, data collection systems, test management and control systems and net-centric connectivity. Augmented effects which will enhance the live urban environment will be incorporated for test specific needs.  Flexibility in changing the configuration of the live environment and effects will enhance testing capability.<br><br>Detailed Requirements:<br>PM ITTS is looking for companies who can provide products or construction techniques to provide the live urban testing environment. The live urban environment is expected to be composed of representations of varied building types.  These representative buildings include one and two story residential buildings, five story apartment buildings, four story commercial buildings, two story industrial buildings and three story administrative buildings.   Construction methods and technologies desired include the ability to modify the urban environment by changing configurations of the representative buildings from test to test.  Changes will include varying the material effects of the buildings as well as the height, width and depth of the buildings.   There is no requirement to use actual materials, but the effect of the material must be representative of the building types listed.  Typical walls to be represented include mass brick or concrete masonry units, or reinforced concrete frames with light cladding, heavy cladding and infill.  Other representative building types desired include steel framed with heavy cladding.  Windows, doors and interior features such as walls, stairs and fixtures may be included in selected representative buildings.  Roof materials and configurations will also vary or need to be changed from flat to pitched and of varied types.  Material types for roofs include but are not limited to concrete, asphalt shingle and metal.  Material types for walls include but are not limited to stucco, brick, concrete, wood, metal and varied thickness glass. Some representations will be of unfinished buildings.  The ability to re-configure the buildings in size, dimension, height and material effects as well as move the buildings within the test site or to another test site is desired.  <br><br>Expected operation of this live environment includes configuring a representative urban environment for a test, and upon completion of the test, reconfiguring the environment for a different test.  Durability, ease of assembly and disassembly with no special tools or equipment is highly encouraged.  Durability issues are important as these representations are expected to be assembled and disassembled repeatedly.  Speed of assembly and disassembly with limited resources is highly desired.  These representations are expected to perform in high winds, with and without special preparation to the site.  The ability to assemble these building representations without foundations is desired.  <br><br>Reconfigurability of the structures is defined as the ability to change the material effects (e.g., electromagnetic effects, infrared signature, and acoustic properties) and the ability to disassemble and move the structures within the urban area or transport to another test site. All approaches to reconfiguration will be reviewed.  Approaches might include the use of modules of varied dimensions that can be swapped in and out, stacked to represent multiple stories, or application of skins to existing modules to vary the material effect.

<DESC>Notice of Sole Source Intent
This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Regional Office intends to award an invasive species management contract to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks for the Angostura Reservoir in Fall River County, Belle Fourche Reservoir in Butte County, Shadehill Reservoir in Perkins County and James Diversion Dam lands in Spink and Beadle Counties.  While Reclamation maintains the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the above mentioned areas, the administration of the reservoir lands and recreation management programs has been delegated to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Park through a Memorandum of Understanding.  Therefore, Reclamation has found the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks to be the only source with local knowledge and experience with the existing and potential invasive species on the approximately 8,763 acres of Reclamation lands.
This procurement is being conducted pursuant to Part 12 and Subpart 13.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Since Reclamation believes that only one responsible source can fully provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared and approved by the Great Plains Regional Office Chief of Contracting.
The Government intends to award this requirement on or around June 24, 2011.  Vendors that recognize they can fully provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  In order to allow for sufficient Government consideration and potential quote evaluation, vendors shall submit their written Letter of Interest no later than June 14, 2011.  Responses received after June 14, 2011 may not be considered by the Government.
Responses to this notice should be mailed to the Bureau of Reclamation - GP-5000; 316 North 26th Street; Billings, Montana 59101, or faxed to 406-247-7798, Attn:  Christine Mundt, or e-mailed to cmundt@usbr.gov.  All responses should include the vendor's Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Vendors should additionally identify themselves as either a "small business" or an "other than small business" under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561730.  The applicable Small Business Size Standard is $7.0 million.
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Should the Government decide to conduct a competitive procurement, then quotes will be due on or around June 17, 2011.
Note 1:  Effective October 1, 2003, any contractor interested in doing business with the federal government must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Contractors may register at http://www.ccr.gov.
Note 2:  Effective January 1, 2005, any contractor submitting a quotation, offer or proposal to the government must complete their representations and certifications online.  All representations and certifications which use to appear in Section K are now located online.  To complete the online representations and certification, contractors shall register in the Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt intends to negotiate a firm fixed price one year bridge Task Order with immixTechnology using their GSA Contract #GS-35F-0265X for Oracle hosting services. The current Task Order, TPD-ARC-08-K-00019, was awarded with a period of performance of 7/25/2008 - 7/24/2018 under immixTechnology's previous GSA Contract, GS-35F-0330J. However, GSA and immixTechnology negotiated a new contract, GS-35F-0265X, effective 3/3/2011. As such, Option Year 3 cannot be exercised for the period 7/25/2011 - 7/24/2012.
<p>Due to time constraints, a bridge Task Order for the period 7/25/2011 - 7/24/2012 will be awarded to immixTechnology. The proposed contract will bridge a gap between the end of the current Task Order, and the award of the follow-on task order to be competed and provide continuity of services for these mission critical requirements.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this request can be emailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov - Attention: TRosenlieb-JC.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase expiring September 30, 2011 with Pacific Identifications.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, requires an analysis of fish bones compared to otter scat collected from the Buldir and Attu Islands of Alaska.
Back Ground:Between 1991 and 2003 the FWS participated in a multidisciplinary archaeological project with a number of partners, including the University of Kansas.  Archaeological investigation on the island of Buldir in the Alaska Maritime NWR resulted in a modest collection of fish bones.  Fish bone analysis is a specialized filed requiring good comparative collections and none of the principles in the excavation had the necessary expertise.  The collection was sent to Pacific Identifications in Victoria BC by the University of Kansas partner for analysis.  Due to limited funding the entire fish collection could not be analyzed.  The analyzed remains were returned to FWS for curation but PacID kept the rest in case additional funding became available.  The research team focused on completing reports for research on Shemya Island and deferred analysis of collections from Buldir and Attu Islands.  The team now plans to complete analysis and reports for Buldir beginning in fall of 2011.
Work Description:The vendor will complete the analysis of fish bones recovered from a prehistoric archaeological site on Buldir Island in the 1990's.  Fish remains will be identified to genus and species if possible, family if necessary.  Each identifiable element will be listed in a table along with taxonomic identification and a breakdown by size.  Size will be determined for each individual species-for example cod sizes will be based on the other cod bones.  
The vendor will use the analyzed fish bone collection from Buldir to compare with samples taken from the dens of otters.  This analysis will identify the species used by the otters.  In addition the size of the bones, degree of breakage, and other aspects of their physical conditions will be compared.  Differences in the two collections will be described and diagnostic traits defined.  
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accepts proposals received.

<DESC>The Government intends to award an out of scope modification to J.L. Malone & Associates under contract W91278-10-C-0084, for the upgrade to the Walter F. George Switchyard. The out of scope work involves the installation of Government Furnished, 15KV, switchgear in the Walter F. George powerhouse. This includes removal of the existing switchgear equipment, modification of the equipment pad, and all connection from the station service feeders as well as connection of the 15KV cable bus feeders to the main power transformers.  The installation shall coincide with the other ongoing work under existing contracts W91278-10-C-0084 and W91278-10-C-0126 which were both competitively awarded to J.L. Malone & Associates.  Under these contracts J.L. Malone is installing the aforementioned transformers and other high voltage equipment which must be connected to the switchgear.  To have J.L Malone connect the equipment under contracts W91278-C-0084 and W91278-10-C-0126 to the new switchgear rather than the old switchgear will eliminate duplicative effort and cost. It is in the best interest of the Government to have J. L. Malone install the new switchgear equipment now so that J. L. Malone will be responsible for the total interface of all the equipment.  <br><br>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions should be sent by email to Geanette Kelley, at geanette.kelley@usace.army.mil.  <br>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

The offeror shall also include any discount terms, cage code, DUNS number, tax identification number, size of business, acknowledgement of solicitation amendments (if any), and a statement that the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, has been completed electronically online at http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx.   <br><br><br>PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. The offeror shall provide information concerning three  to five of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within three years before the date for the Government's receipt of proposals.  (Offerors with less than three relevant previous contracts shall provide information on as many as available.  Offerors without relevant contracts shall so indicate.) Relevant contracts are those that reflect that the offeror has the capability to perform the requirements stated in this solicitation.  Contracts in which the contractor performed work of a similar scope, magnitude, and complexity as those required under this solicitation will be given greater weight in the past performance evaluation than those of a lesser or different scope.  Contracts that provided all aspects of the work required by this solicitation will be given greater weight than those for only portions of the work required. More recent contracts will be given greater weight than older ones.<br>The evaluation of past performance will take into account information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to this acquisition.  In addition, the Government may use past performance information obtained from other than that provided by the offeror.  Past performance information is limited to no more than two pages per contract listed.  Information submitted should contain at least the following for each contract/reference: <br>- Contract number.<br>- Period of Performance.<br>- Contract Type (e.g., fixed price, time-and-materials, etc.)<br>- Government or commercial contract and the dollar amount.<br>- Summary description of any subcontractor and the scope of involvement.  <br>- Contracting agency or company, including name and telephone number of contract administrator, buyer or contracting officer.<br>- Description of amount of propane supplied and delivery requirements.  <br>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: lowest price technically acceptable, considering past performance.  Past performance will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable. (Offerors with no relevant past performance will be evaluated as acceptable.)<br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items ALT I<br>52.223-13 Certification of Toxic Chemical Release Reporting<br>52.233-2 Service of Protest<br>Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from Amy Franklin, Contracting Officer, MICC-Directorate of Contracting, 1676 Evans St. Bldg. 1220, 3rd fl, Fort Carson, CO 80913-5198.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>Background

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.

The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by bridges. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&ISs Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&ISs Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Centers Hospital Information System (CRIS).

 

Purpose


This request is for the purchase of renewing the maintenance contract with Cerner Corp. for its Radiology Information System (RIS). The Cener RIS is a proprietary system in daily use by the RAD&IS for critical patient care.   The current contract expires May 31, 2011.    A renewal of the exiting contract is needed to provide support for the RIS until it is replaced.    The replacement date is tentatively set for December 2011  (Contract Number HHSN269301000204P).  The renewal should be executed in four-month periods, as a full year of service will probably not be needed.


Scope

To the continue service of the existing RIS system for the Department of Radiology and Imaging Science in the Clinical Center   The Cener RIS is a critical patient care system in daily use within the Clinical Center in support of care of diagnostic and research studies for patients in clinical protocols and the NIH Clinical Center mission of providing quality patient care.

N00244L332, UNIT PRICES (OCT 2001) (FISC SAN DIEGO)
Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, will be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without further notice to the contractor submitter.
  If the Contractor takes issue with the release, it should submit its proposal data with the appropriate legends and explain in detail why such data cannot be released as a public record under the Freedom of Information Act.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Technical capability of the item to meet the requirement
(ii)	Ability to meet the required delivery date
(iii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable.
 Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate delivery time as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.  Technical and delivery time, when combined, are equal to price.
 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating commercial product brochures, drawings and technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.
 Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c) The Governments required delivery date is clearly defined above.  Ability to meet the required delivery date and shipping terms shall be demonstrated by the offerors submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required date and terms.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
 Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
This announcement will close at 1 PM PST on 8 June 2011.  Submit offers via email to Shannon La Com who can be reached at (T) 562.626.7104 or email Shannon.lacom@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/  . 
 
Questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via email to the above Government point of contact.

<DESC>HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />SBA 2011 Field Management Conference<br />PROPOSED DATES ARE FIRM FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY, JULY 17, 2011 THROUGH FRIDAY, JULY 22, 2011
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $30.0 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of our agency is critically linked to our ability to align our program or individual office goals with the strategic goals of the SBA. For an organization of our size, our managers and frontline leaders must work in concert and not cross-purposes. We've already begun this process by having our frontline leaders work collaboratively with their program department counterparts to identify critical skills and develop training materials that are relevant for both sides. We'd like to build on that momentum by utilizing our time in Denver to gain a shared understanding of SBA's strategic plan and how our 2012 district office and program department goals will be informed by the plan.</p>
<p>The goals of the conference are:</p>
<p>1. To identify, share and begin to implement customer service best practices across the agency.<br />2. To examine and identify the customer and partner experience with the agency's programs and services.<br />3. Identify ways to strengthen our customer service while managing performance across all of our field management units.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND<br />The SBA Field Management Conference is aimed at SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, July 17th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, July 18th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, July 18th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event, the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 150 participants. Likewise, SBA may need four smaller work rooms to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, all rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference, therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 150 adults. The four meeting rooms shall be required to comfortably accommodate 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings.

<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference.

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008) ADDENDUM</p>
<p>52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) <br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this Internet address http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html <br />(End of provision)<br />52.202-1 Definitions (Jul 2004) <br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are _ are not _ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have _ have not _, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are _ are not _ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have _, have not _, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has _ has not _, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision) <br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision- <br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. <br />"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means- <br />(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and <br />(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). <br />(b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000. <br />(c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information: <br />(1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: <br />(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction. <br />(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. <br />(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in- <br />(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or <br />(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. <br />(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. <br />(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. <br />(d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). <br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (End of provision) <br />52.209-8 Updates of Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) <br />(a) The Contractor shall update the information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) on a semi-annual basis, throughout the life of the contract, by entering the required information in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). <br />(b)(1) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor's record. <br />(2) The Contractor will have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government. The comments will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor comments will remain a part of the record unless the Contractor revises them. <br />(3) With the exception of the Contractor, only Government personnel and authorized users performing business on behalf of the Government will be able to view the Contractor's record in the system. Public requests for system information will be handled under Freedom of Information Act procedures, including, where appropriate, procedures promulgated under E.O. 12600. (End of clause) <br />52.211-14 Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense, Emergency Preparedness, and Energy Program Use (Apr 2008) <br />Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be __ DX rated order; X DO rated order certified for national defense, emergency preparedness, and energy program use under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) (15 CFR 700), and the Contractor will be required to follow all of the requirements of this regulation.<br />52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997) <br />As prescribed in 15.408(I), replace the text of the basic provision with the following:<br />(a) Submission of Cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) Submit Other Than Cost or Pricing Data as if you were submitting Cost and Pricing Data.

The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft: <br />SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET FOR REQUIREMENTS<br />It is anticipated that a non-competitive purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), American Eurocopter Corp. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.<br />It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corp is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. Required delivery is as stated on the attached spreadsheet of requirements. Deliver to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section, Bldg 63, Elizabeth City, NC. FOB Point - Destination.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
Background:  The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) Core Laboratory processes and stores specimens for clinical trials run by the VA Cooperative Studies Program. The laboratory is getting ready for a large scale genomics project that will require processing of up to 1000 samples a day in addition to existing and ongoing processing for other Cooperative Studies Program projects. These machines were selected for isolating DNA from the collected and processed samples. Acquisition of the Beckman Coulter machines was not based simply on the selection of a liquid handler-it was a process of looking for a vendor(s) that could provide a system for isolating DNA from up to 1000 human blood buffy coats per day with a minimum yield of about 15 ug at a total cost of less than $2.50 per sample. The requested equipment is necessary to guarantee accurate and sufficient operation of the machines, provide study stake-holders and analysis labs with high quality DNA, and to facilitate the processing of such a large volume of samples.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System is requesting the following line items manufactured by Beckman Coulter, 250 South Kraemer Blvd, Brea, CA 92822-8000.      
The Government is looking for a FIRM-FIXED PRICE for all items requested below.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">1). What information can USPS provide about the existing portfolio of billboards?&nbsp; Number of signs, size, location, are they leases or licenses, what percentage have interstate frontage, and when do they expire?&nbsp;How many billboards are already up on USPS properties?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is there a list of current locations?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- A relatively small number. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>About 23 - albeit locations that are likely to be considered some of our most valuable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seven are in NYC - three in Miami and the rest are literally scattered around the country - 1 here, 1 there - etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A specific list will not be provided at this time and we would hope the absence of this list isn't what determines a decision to respond to this RFP. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">2). If an outdoor company bid and won this contract, would they be prohibited them from executing the build out and ad selling of billboards on USPS properties themselves?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The winning Respondent / Outdoor Company (Commercial Outdoor Advertising Management Services provider) would not be prohibited from executing the construction of any structures, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, these costs, if not competitively bid out to subcontractors would somehow need to be validated as the costs being appropriate and reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The winning Respondent / Outdoor Company (Commercial Outdoor Advertising Management Services provider) also needs to solicit for the advertisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The license agreements the advertisers will execute (with the USPS) will be our standard license agreement we have used with our existing advertisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only prohibition test is to ensure that 1) the winning Respondent / Outdoor Company does not have a conflict of interest with the advertisers. In other words there is no financial or legal relationship between you and the Advertiser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- Example - CBS has an outdoor advertising company. They win the bid - they would be prohibited from having CBS or its affiliates as advertisers and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2) the Advertiser is NOT getting preferred / non competitive treatment and 3) we get highest revenue possible<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(which is traditionally proven via competitive offers)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>Background

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.

The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by bridges. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&ISs Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&ISs Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Centers Hospital Information System (CRIS).
 
Purpose


This request is for the purchase of renewing the maintenance contract with Cerner Corp. for its Radiology Information System (RIS). The Cener RIS is a proprietary system in daily use by the RAD&IS for critical patient care. The current contract expires May 31, 2011.  A renewal of the exiting contract is needed to provide support for the RIS until it is replaced.  
Scope

To the continue service of the existing RIS system for the Department of Radiology and Imaging Science in the Clinical Center   The Cener RIS is a critical patient care system in daily use within the Clinical Center in support of care of diagnostic and research studies for patients in clinical protocols and the NIH Clinical Center mission of providing quality patient care.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Amendment 0</strong><strong>1</strong>: </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions and Answers</span><br /><br /></strong>The following are the questions received by the cut-off date listed in the solicitation, and the corresponding answers.<br /><br /><strong>Question 1)</strong> Do you want/expect the GO/FO/SES to work full time as the primary consultant on the project?
<p><strong>Answer 1)</strong> The contractor leading the performance review only needs to work the number of hours that is required to fully meet the required deliverables within the specified timeline. We expect the primary contractor to describe their methodology, work closely with the USUHS administrative executive, establish a schedule for the deliverables, and identify the methods and individuals who will work on each step of the assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2)</strong> Is it an acceptable approach for the GO/FO/SES to lead the team as primary POC joined by a full time professional consultant?</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2)</strong> The composition of the contractor team is up to the discretion of the contractor, but needs to be driven by the requirements articulated in the solicitation. The contractor may add other people to the team, providing the lead member of the team meets the education and experience qualifications noted under "Requirement &amp; Background" and "Qualifications/Evaluations." The budget will not change.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 3)</strong> Please confirm that Price will be FFP for the engagement and Cost Reimburseable for Travel (estimate to be included in cost proposal).</p>
<p><strong>Answer 3)</strong> Yes, this is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4)</strong> Please clarify clearance requirements, if any.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 4)</strong> There are no security clearance requirements associated with this project.</p>

<CONTACT>ANGELA DENISE TAYLOR, Contract Negotiator, Phone 405-739-4341, Fax 405-622-7556, Email angela.d.taylor@tinker.af.mil - William  T Stark, Contracting Officer, Phone (405)739-2318, Fax (405)739-5451, Email william.stark@tinker.af.mil
<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION:<br />The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Aircraft Sustainment Directorate (OC-ALC/GKSKB) located at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma is requesting information and conducting market research to identify and determine if there are potential sources which have the capabilities to provide Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) services for a multi-agency C-37 aircraft requirement. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and market research purposes only and should not be considered as a request for proposal or as a solicitation to do business with the Government. There is no solicitation package available at this time. The historical C-37 CLS (IDIQ) contract F33657-02-D-2011 was awarded to Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation on March 8, 2002. The intended purpose of this RFI is to support a potential bridge effort between the historical C-37 CLS contract (Contract #: F3357-02-D-2011) and the follow-on competitive C-20/C-37 CLS (RFP #: FA8106-11-R-0001) acquisition.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-18(a), "Bid and Proposal (B&amp;P) Costs". All vendor responses are for informational purposes only and shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI must at a minimum be able to describe your company's capabilities and provide a brief synopsis of your ability to meet either all or a portion of the requirements described herein. Recommendations regarding the potential breakout of this requirement will be considered for preliminary planning and market research purposes. Vendor responses to this RFI shall be limited to five (5) pages and include the following administrative information:</p>
<p>- Vendor name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address<br />- Vendor interest in proposing on the solicitation when it is issued<br />- Vendor capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity<br />- Vendor ability to phase-in and phase-out services within period of performance specified below<br />- Vendor type of business size and small business status, as applicable<br />- Vendor joint venture information, as applicable, including existing and potential</p>
<p>(c) Responding vendors shall include Gulfstream GV and G550 aircraft historical data currently obtained and how it has benefited or constrained projects/programs. In addition, provide the organization's dedicated experience with GV and G550 aircraft, including employees trained with the number of years in support of GV and G550 aircraft experience. Resources necessary will include proprietary design, modification, production, and material support data for twenty (20) C-37 aircraft. Additional requirements include the performance of aircraft repair, maintenance, inspections, and modifications C-37 aircraft, please provide experience with these aircraft types. Non-recurring engineering support services may be required in support of aircraft modifications.</p>
<p>(i) The C-37 is a militarized version of the FAA-airworthiness certificated Gulfstream GV and G550 aircraft. The C-37 is powered by twin Rolls Royce BR-710 engines. These aircraft are equipped with specialized mission communication stations. The C-37 mission is to provide worldwide airlift support for senior military leaders and Government officials. The C-37 fleet is maintained In Accordance With (IAW) FAA approved maintenance standards in order to maintain the aircraft FAA Airworthiness/Type Certification. Maintenance requirements that exceed the capabilities at the MOB are accomplished at a Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 145 FAA-certified Gulfstream V and 550 repair station. C-37 aircraft CLS includes all support actions required for operating and maintaining the aircraft, aircraft subsystems, and support equipment. At the MOBs, all permanently assigned personnel working directly on the aircraft are required to have a SECRET clearance as well as the Maintenance Director, Program Manager, Logistics Manager, and Site Lead(s). One of the MOB locations is within Federal Republic of Germany. US citizens performing services on Government contracts may not begin working in Germany without the required approvals. Import/Export of contractor furnished material into Germany is required. Two levels of support are required for this effort, full and partial CLS.</p>
<p>(ii) Full CLS includes all aircraft maintenance and personnel, materials and inspections, launch and recovery of aircraft, management of all Government owned spares and support equipment through a Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS); repair and overhaul of all repairable spares at FAA certified repair stations; maintenance and repair of all support equipment; aircraft paint; engine/Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) repair and overhaul. The supply support requires the contractor to identify, procure, stock, store and issue common and peculiar spare parts, components, consumables and bench stock for the aircraft, aircraft systems, engines/APUs and peculiar test/support equipment. Additional support, as over and above tasks, engineering services including development, test and FAA certification of modifications, installation of modifications, depot maintenance support, field team support (worldwide), deployment support (worldwide), aircraft crash investigations, failure and teardown reports, acquisition of commercial data, and damage repair.</p>
<p>(iii) Partial CLS of the C-37 aircraft at Andrews AFB, MD includes supply of all Government owned spares and support equipment through a COMBS; repair and overhaul of all repairable spares at FAA certified repair stations; maintenance and repair of all support equipment; aircraft paint; engine/APU repair and overhaul and depot level maintenance. These actions include supply, procurement, production control, quality control, engine/APU tear down and completion reports, component failure reports, and acquisition of commercial data. This effort includes additional support, as over and above tasks, engineering services including development, test and FAA certification of modifications, and installation of modifications. Organizational level maintenance for Air Force aircraft at Andrews AFB is accomplished through a separate contract vehicle.</p>
<p>(iv) Rolls Royce BR710 unscheduled maintenance will be required during the base period of this effort. Scheduled and unscheduled engine maintenance will be required during the option periods. Engine support shall be accomplished by using Rolls Royce BR710 Corporate Care or an equivalent program that ensures C-37 engine spares availability.</p>
<p>(v) The majority of the spares on the C-37 are contractor owned and furnished. The current contractor furnished inventory within all COMBS locations is approximately valued at $39M. There is no requirement for the purchase and maintenance of this level of spares. However, the contractor needs to sustain a supply support system that will ensure the mission capability standard (90%) is maintained.</p>
<p>(d) Responding vendors shall answer the following questions:</p>
<p>(i) Will additional data be required in support of C-37 CLS services? If so, what would be the associated cost, if known? <br />(ii) Do you currently provide Aircraft Maintenance and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) to customers who operate small business jets? If so, how many locations, number of aircraft, and model aircraft do you support?<br />(iii) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS to a fleet of business type jet aircraft in excess of twenty (20) aircraft in multiple locations?<br />(iv) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing only COMBS support for military maintainers?

<p>Q) The "Total Evaluated Price" is defined on page 35 of 35 of the solicitation as including the "basic requirement (item 0001AA) and all options (items 0001AB and AC) plus other associated factors such as: first article testing cost, transportation cost, price evaluation adjustments for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, and application of labor hours to labor hour rates, etc." Do all of these "other associated factors" need to be addressed in the bid which is due May 23 at 4PM or will they be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) Any applicable "other associated factors" should be included in&nbsp;the offer since they are a part of the price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Q) On the solicitation contract in block 13, a contractor offeror code and a facility code are requested. What are these and where might we obtain them?</p>
<p>A) The contractor offeror code is the cage code of the specific offeror responding to the solicitation. The facility code is only required if the actual work is to be performed at a facility other than the one associated with the offeror code. Your cage code can be found at http://bpn.gov/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does "Other than high value item" mean in regards to Limitation of Liability?</p>
<p>A) This indicates the applicable Limitation of Liability FAR clause for that item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does PACRN and PAA mean?</p>
<p>A) PACRN is a Packaging Reference Number. The PACRN is a 3-position code that identifies the packaging information for a specific line item or delivery item (i.e. PAA). The PACRN will cross reference the applicability in the Line Item Schedule to the packaging clauses (for example see section D, Packaging and Marking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) During overhaul/remanufacture of a subject Fuel Flow Proportioner, please confirm the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC and up to the BER threshold of 75% of the stock price.</p>
<p>If a unit's remanufacture/overhaul cost exceeds the BER threshold (75% of stock price), is the contractor required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Both the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation discuss what to do in the event an item is considered BER. Additionally, regardless of whether an item is BER or not, the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price unless Over and Above is deemed to be acceptable. See the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation for additional details on Over and Above work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In block 5 of the Solicitation/Contract, the Solicitation Type is listed as "Negotiated." Other than submittal of the signed Solicitation/Contract and all other required documents, will an opportunity for discussion be provided prior to contract award?</p>
<p>A) Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award address discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In TO 6J15-13-11-3 in the Introduction Section page iii/iv under paragraph 4. Repair Kits., the first two sentences read "Some repair parts for the component covered in this manual are provided in the form of a kit. The Illustrated Parts Breakdown identifies these parts." However, we have not found an itemization of the parts contained within the kit is listed by PN 81503-1 in the MPL, but no further identification is provided. Please provide the components of this kit.</p>
<p>A) This parts list can be requested.&nbsp; Please follow the same procedures as if requesting a T.O.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) [It was previously] indicated that only the proportioner NSN 2915-01-147-2644 is to be overhauled by this solicitation and not the hydraulic motor or, as I understand it, the assembly PN 60957. To this end, what other and/or attaching parts need not be addressed in the overhaul of the proportioner? As an example, the solicitation requires 100% replacement of, among other parts, Figure 10 &amp; Index 3, PN M25988/1-135 packing, but this packing is at the same indentation level as the proportioner itself. In other words, if we are to receive, overhaul, and test only the proportioner (utilizing a slave hydraulic motor), we will not be able to install this packing since it goes between the proportioner and hydraulic motor.</p>
<p>A) T.O. 33DA36-88-1 Operation and Maintenance Instructions; Fuel Flow Proportioner Test Stand, has the requirements to test the Proportioner. The O ring can be changed as per T.O. 33DA36-88-1. (i.e. Put a new O ring on when you put the Fuel Flow Proportioner on the slave hydraulic motor.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) Is the stock list price of $13,123.08, listed in Item No. 0001, the government price for a new proportioner?</p>
<p>A) The stock list price (SLP) is the price we have on record for what a new proportioner would cost. See page 3of the solicitation for additional information regarding the SLP.</p>

<DESC>TO: ALL Potential Respondents- this is a Final RFI; the content and submission date remain the same<br /><br />SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) Regarding SMC Development Planning Directorate's (SMC/XR) Reusable Booster System (RBS) High-Thrust Main Engine requirement.
<p>1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Directorate of Development Planning (XR), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is seeking information from interested parties on liquid booster engines and associated technologies which satisfy the preliminary requirements of the RBS. XR is seeking an existing engine system, not a future developmental concept.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on rocket engine options that could be used as the RBS main propulsion system or that could potentially replace the RD-180 main engine on the Atlas V EELV (Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle). SMC is only interested in receiving information on those engines whose intellectual property rights for technology, design, and production are wholly owned by a United States corporation in order to support National Security Space missions. This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research purposes.</p>
<p>3. In order for SMC to develop the most cost effective on-ramp strategy, inputs from industry on potential propulsion options and enabling technologies are essential. To ensure that cost, schedule and performance constraints are considered, we request that information pertaining to each of these specific areas be addressed for those designs which meet the following overall requirements to be addressed in response to this RFI:</p>
<p>a. The contractor must possess and demonstrate to the Government full engine ownership of all design and production intellectual property rights to support domestic production without end use restrictions<br />b. Engine propellants must be LOX/RP<br />c. Sea level thrust 300 - 500-klbs<br />d. Sea level thrust to weight &gt; 85<br />e. Sea level Isp &gt; 300 seconds<br />a. Vacuum Isp &gt; 330 seconds<br />b. Engine reuse threshold of 10 missions with another 10 missions after overhaul<br />c. High reusable engine reliability with minimal per flight touch labor<br />d. Engine must operate at throttle levels down to 50% rated thrust<br />e. In-flight restart capability is of significant interest</p>
<p>4. Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that includes the following sections written in Microsoft Word 2000 or later or Adobe Acrobat Exchange Portable Document Format (.pdf) (with copy/paste function enabled):</p>
<p>a. Technical Description: Identify assemblies, components, and subsystems including physical dimensions, weight and power requirements.<br />b. Technology assessment: Assess the technology critical to engine design using Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to the subsystem level whenever possible. In order to minimize misinterpretation of TRL levels, provide a brief narrative of the current state of maturity of each major component, unit and interface. When possible, describe the heritage of each assembly/component and interface, particularly its pedigree in proven space flight.<br />c. Expected Performance: Assess proposed engine system against system requirements listed in paragraph 3 above.<br />d. Development Schedule: Identify proposed schedule to include critical paths and discuss schedule drivers (e.g. long lead items). Supporting information from previous similar programs should be provided.<br />e. Cost Estimate: Provide a basis for budgetary estimates on the proposed engine system. Include: Confidence level, Basis of Estimate, heritage program(s) from which costs are derived, and cost risk and drivers.<br />f. Risk Analysis: Discuss the risks and mitigation plans associated with the proposed system including any risk and mitigation strategies required for integration and manufacturing<br />g. Intellectual Property Rights:<br />o Provide a description on the origin of engine design and production rights. If all or portions of the engine technology are derived from foreign sources, describe how the appropriate intellectual rights were acquired to produce the engine within the United States without legal dispute (e.g., licensing agreement). Also provide a description of the level of the data rights (i.e. unlimited rights, restricted rights), expiration timeframes (if any), end use agreements, etc.<br />o If the contractor proposes an engine whose intellectual property is not currently owned by a U.S. corporation, then specify the proposed licensing process, reviews, approvals, cost (to include manufacturing risk reduction), and schedule required to satisfy paragraph 3a.</p>

Based on responses to RFQ VA-69D-11-RQ-0757 entitled "Warming System" for the Edward Hines VA Hospital, Hines, IL," award has been made to Medical Solutions, Incorporated, Inc. at the total contract amount of $75,175.00 as lowest price technically acceptable to the Government. 

Thank you for your interest in this procurement.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
3 Liter Bag Warming System, Hines VA
	
1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the purchase of a 3 Liter Bag Warming System for the VA Hospital in Hines, IL.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Medical Solutions, INC. 

3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL, has a requirement for a one time purchase of a 3 Liter Bag Warming System used for warming various fluid like I.V fluids or various fluids of the body.  The approximate cost is $79,950.00 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL requires this exact model because it is the only model on the market that fulfills the hospitals needs of the following;  
The only product that has monitors and displays the actual fluid temperature of each bag, monitors and displays the actual time bag has been warming, rapidly warms three liter bags in about an hour, the documenter assists in compliance with regulatory standards and fluid manufacturers' recommendations, and provides Time/Date Stamp Technology, it has the capacity of holding (8) 3000 ml bags, and lastly the locking cabinet assists in compliance with regulatory standards. This vendor is the only one that makes a irrigation warmer for a 3 liter bag of fluid. 

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  A search of GSA, SBA and Vetbizops did not reveal another system with the characteristics that Ms. Miller has requested. GSA had 2 similar but did not have what Hines needed. I sent 3 FSS vendor contracts to Hines staff for their review. Hines staff determined that the 3 vendors FSS contracts did not contain an item that could meet their needs. A FedBizOpps publication will announce the intent to sole source this requirement.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Overall pricing will be compared to contractor's list prices.

8.	Market survey conducted:  Barbara Miller, has indicated that this is a sole source requirement/need that is critical to their department and vital to direct patient care, throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs Agency. The Contracting Officer researched GSA, FBO, SBA and Vetbiz to verify this is a Sole Source.

9.	Other facts:  Exact model was previously purchased as a sole source and there were no objections from contractors/vendors to the FBO posting and SSJ.

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  A FEDBIZOPPS ad may generate alternate sources.

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The Contracting Officer searched the Dynamic Small Business Search feature of CCR and VetBiz Registry and located 3 small businesses but a search of their schedules did not reveal comparable products. 






12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. It is executed on behalf of the 174th FW Security Forces Squadron.</p>
<p>2. The 174 FW proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition purchase and installation of the Back up Intelligent Video Surveillance System Server.</p>
<p>3. The purchase is at a cost of $7,580<br /><br />4. Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>a. FAR 6.302-1, only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government</p>
<p>b. 10 USC 2304(c)(2)</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a purchase order to purchase and install of the Back up Intelligent Video Surveillance System Server. The statutory authority cited is FAR 6.302-1(2)(iii)(A)(B), Substantial Duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. G Technologies Corporation was the subcontractor on the initial system which was installed last year. G Technologies holds the warranty on the cameras for the existing system. If we allowed another contractor to work on the system it would void the warranty on the current system. G Technologies also has the necessary software to configure the new cameras with the software on the existing system. There would be a substantial duplication of cost if the government were to award to last year's prime contractor or another contractor through mark ups and non familiarity of the system which would also delay the project. The pricing on this proposal was compared with the current wage determinations and last year's contract, therefore the price is deemed fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leanne S. Holmes, TSgt, NYANG<br />Contracting Officer</p>

Justification and Approval
for
Other than Full and Open Competition
Contracting Organization: This is a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for Purchase Request #548-11-1-5731-0001, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, VAMC West Palm Beach. The contracting activity responsible for the proposed contracting action is Service Area Organization East, Network Contracting Activity 8, West Palm Beach.
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: The action being reviewed and approved is for the purchase and installation of Siemens proprietary building automation controllers which are BacNet compatible for the control of 55 Air Handing Units "minimum outdoor air dampers sets" digital output, and exhaust fan cycling of selected/coordinating exhaust fans. This is an approved VISN Energy Project, #548-11-201, and the action will be awarded as a new, firm fixed price contract.
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: This request calls for the installation of BACNet panels to control the minimum OA dampers on 52 AHU's. This will include 52 each: PXCIOOBACNet, PXA-ENC19, PXA-SCU Power Supply, and TXM1-8U, miscellaneous conduit, wire and fasteners, installation, software, system programming of the dampers, fans and graphics, system testing and system backup. The estimated value of the project is $291,885. The performance period of the project is anticipated to be twelve (12) weeks after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. The program supports our energy program and is supported by the VISN 8 Energy Manager. In addition to controlling the outside air dampers, this project also requires the modification of the TOD schedules for the exhaust air system in the building. In general, by closing off 159,000 cfm of supply air entering the building, we must also limit exhausting a percentage of that air to maintain a building with a slightly positive pressure. Therefore, this project also calls for the programming of certain exhaust fans to be cycled off during modified outside air dampers events. A single emergency point shall be created and graphically represented on the main graphic screen and shall shut Wall dampers and associated exhaust fans upon demand with an interacting icon on the graphic's screen. The OA Damper project is also intended to be used in the future with daytime control CO2 controls. This project will also provide a means to close outside air dampers to the facility when perimeter outdoor environmental concerns are present surrounding the facility. The project will be done using new Siemens BacNet compatible controllers. Although the existing Siemen's system is proprietary, this type of controller will enable full and open competition in the future when building automation modifications or expansions are needed.
 
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented by Far 6.302-1(a)(2) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of the authority): The existing 1995 vintage Power 600 building automation system is a Siemen's proprietary system and is not an open protocol system. At the time the VAMC WPB was built, 16 years ago, only proprietary systems were available in the industry, completely restricting the availability of building automation services and parts to the one providing supplier. Since that time, the industry has changed and open protocol systems are now available from all the building controls manufacturers. However, the cost to replace an entire building automation system in a building this size would cost several million dollars, would be very disruptive to the building occupants and the IIVAC service to the hospital, and total replacement is not necessary at this time. This energy reduction project cleverly uses Siemens own (newer) open protocol system to achieve the goals of this project, and also opens up limited future projects for competition by using the BACNet open protocol system. Accordingly, Siemen's is the only firm capable of providing the specific equipment and services described in Section 3, which are essential to meeting the government's requirements without the Veteran's lIealth Administration incurring a substantial duplication of costs that cannot be reasonably expected to be recovered through competition. Siemen's is the only authorized provider of the required supplies, and only authorized installer of items directly to this system, and as such their products and services are essential to meeting the Government's requirements.
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: The existing Siemen's System 600/Apogee System is a proprietary system installed at the VAMC West Palm Beach when in was constructed sixteen (16) years ago. .Documentation was requested and received from Siemen's indicating that they are the only authorized agent/manufacturer of the parts and equipment, and the only authorized technicians/engineers capable of providing the requirements of this request. Their (Siemen's letter dated January 27, 2011 can be found in the contract file, Tab P02).
To confirm the validity of the Siemen's self certification as the sole source for this requirement, a Sources Sought Notice, VA-248-11-RP-0107, was posted to FBO on January 14, 2011 IAW FAR 6.303-2(a)(6) since no specific exemption exists under FAR 5.202. The closing date of the Sources Sought Notice was January 28, 2011. The Sources Sought Notice instructed interested parties to submit their qualifications and authorization to provide the required equipinent and labor on the Siemen's System 600/Apogee System. As instructed in the Sources Sought Notice, four contractors submitted their qualifications (the responses to the Sources Sought Notice can be found in the contract file at tab P02). In evaluating these submissions, it was determined that all interested vendors intended to purchase supplies and subcontract the work on this project to Siemen's as the sole source provider. It is apparent from the response to the Sources Sought Notice, that Siemen's is the solely authorized
 
supplier of the required parts, and the solely authorized installer of parts for the existing system, as indicated in their self certification.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the  Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The Independent Government Estimate for this project is $291,855. Two methods of determining price reasonableness will be used: comparison of the proposed price to the Independent Government Estimate, and comparison of proposed contractor pricing to published prices for the same items manufactured by Siemen's and available to the general public.
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research was not Conducted. The current building automation system is a proprietary system to Siemens. Siemen's letter dated January 27, 2011 found in the contract file at tab P02 attests to that fact. Additional market research in the form of a Sources Sought Notice, VA-248-11-RP-0107 was conducted by the CO to determine that the information provided by Siemen's is in fact valid. The Sources Sought Notice closed on January 28, 2011, with a response from four interested contractors. Two of the responses indicated they were not an authorized distributer of the parts required, or an authorized installer, but would subcontract the work. Two of the responses indicated that the contractors were partners with Siemen's and authorized to perform the work. The CO sought further clarification of these statements from Siemen's and was informed that the companies were not partners and were not authorized to do the work, but that Siemen's had agreed to be their subcontractor and perform all work, in the event that the solicitation was posted for competition. This does not meet the Government's requirement for an authorized provider.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Modification of the existing Siemen's system IAW the SOW for this project, will serve to make parts of the system more compatible with open protocol systems that exist in the market today. Although it will not convert the entire system to an open protocol system, it will convert parts of it to a system that will allow for competition for some future work. -
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Five contractors entered their information on the MO Interested Vendors List in conjunction with the Sources Sought Notice dated January 14, 2011. Four contractors submitted the requested information by the closing date of the Sources Sought Notice (January 28, 2011). The Interested Vendors List and the responses from the contractors have been included in the contract file.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or to Overcome Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisition for the supplies or
services required: By initiating the installation of some parts and sub systems, the agency is taking steps towards bringing the air handling system at VAMC WPB more in line with the open protocol systems available in the industry now that were unavailable 16 years ago. This action will help to ensure that some of the future maintenance and repair work on the system will be available for full and open competition, and that upon
 
determination that the existing system requires replacement, an open protocol system will be available that will be able to utilize the sub system that is being installed as part of this project. Both accomplishments will allow for greater competition in the future.
12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief
