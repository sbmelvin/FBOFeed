Every year wild horses that are determined to be excess on the public lands are removed and placed in the Adopt-A-Horse program.  This program places wild horses and burros into private homes around the country.  The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Piney Woods (PW) is charged with taking care of these animals on their journey to private adopted homes.  The primary feeding of alfalfa\grass hay is through the use of large round bales.  Alfalfa\grass hay ensures the care of wild horses on the facility. This will be the largest amount of hay needed to be supplied by the contractor.  Piney Woods also feeds animals in the smaller load pens and sick pens using small square bales.

<DESC>THIS CONTRACTING ACTION IS BEING OFFERED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND RE-INVESTMENT ACT (ARRA).

The Forest Service has a requirement for crushing and stockpiling gravel from the Big Creek gravel pit.  The source of the material to be crushed is a Government-owned pit on the National Forest System land.  This pit has been used before to produce crushed aggregate for road surfacing.  The Quality control of all work performed to provide the end product is the Offeror's responsibility.  The Government will inspect the work periodically to ensure quality is being met.

Project Location:  The Big Creek Gravel Pit is located on the Superior Ranger District, Lolo National Forest, Mineral County, Montana, on the Big Creek Road No.386, Forest Road No. 18654.  

No pre-quote Site Visit is scheduled, however, Offerors are encouraged to visit the site and review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision #52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work (Apr 1984).  Failure of the Offeror to ascertain the nature, location, and conditions which affect the work will not relieve the Offeror from the resposibility for successfully performing the work without addtional expense to the Government. Any questions regarding the project may be directed to Nate Kegel, at (406) 822-3927.

The project cost estimate is $250,000 - $500,000.  All work must be completed by 01 September 2011.

All responsible Offerors may submit a quote which will be considered by the Government, IAW FAR 4.1102(a), and prospective must be registered in CCR.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to implement therestructuring of the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite(NPOESS).  The existing program was managed through a tri-agency organization and thisgovernance is being eliminated and the primary responsibility of the afternoon orbitsatellites now belongs to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) andthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  These satellites provide civilweather forecasting and climate data in a program now called the Joint Polar SatelliteSystem (JPSS).	This transition includes in-process builds for four instruments and aground system. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole source procurement to each of the following companiesfor the following efforts:  Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems  Visible Infrared ImagerRadiometer Suite (VIIRS); ITT Space Systems - Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS); BallAerospace and Technologies  Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS); Northrop GrummanElectronic Systems  Advanced Technology Microware Sounder; and Raytheon Intelligence andInformation Systems  JPSS/NPP Ground System.  The intent of the restructure directed by the Executive Office of the President was totransfer, to a NASA management structure, the existing complement of afternoon orbitinstruments and ground system.	To insure the successful completion and launch of theJPSS spacecraft with no loss of continuity in critical climate and weather forecastingdata, a requirement exists that NASA contract directly with the instrument and groundsystem developers, in order to have direct oversight and design/engineering input intothe development and testing process and to insure that the necessary mission assurancestandards are met.  The above mentioned contractors are uniquely qualified for thesecontracts as they are currently developing and building their respective instruments andground system. To successfully transition the current VIIRS, CrIS, OMPS, ATMS instrumentsand ground system, requires the contractors, that are currently building these effortstoday, continue on with the original build as they are the only source that can ensuredata continuity for weather and storm forecasting.  No sources other than the existinginstrument and ground system developers have the knowledge or capabilities to build andprovide instruments or a ground system that can support the JPSS mission requirements atthis stage of the program and most definitely without a break in data continuity.  Awardto any other source would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencysrequirements.Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)  Only OneResponsible Source.  However, any organization who believes they can provide these itemswithout any detrimental impact to the program mission should fully identify theirinterest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of the synopsis.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform anyof these efforts in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5:00 pm ESTon April 26, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (LM MS2) of Moorestown, New Jersey to serve as the Aegis Ashore Engineering Agent (AAEA) and the Weapon System adaptation source for Aegis Ashore.  This effort is part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) (MDA AB) Program and requires efforts to adapt, integrate, test, deliver, install and field the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) as an ashore configuration of BMD capability.  The contractor shall provide program management, system engineering, computer program adaptation and test, system integration and test, and support certification, validation and verification for adapting the AWS to a removable shore configuration.  The contractor shall provide design, installation, test, and checkout services and the necessary miscellaneous hardware to demonstrate the adapted AWS in an ashore configuration.  The contractor shall assist with the design, assembly, and demonstration of the removable structure by working with the Government’s design and construction agent for the adaptable ashore system configuration.  The contractor shall support the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) flight tests, ground tests, and simulation events en route to an operational capability for all ashore sites to include test sites.  The contractor shall provide support and maintenance for the shore adapted AWS to include the transition and transfer.  The contractor shall work in close collaboration with the Prime Contractors for the other MDA BMDS Elements and the MDA National Teams to optimize Aegis Ashore performance as part of the BMDS.  LM MS2 has been the prime contractor for Aegis Weapon System (AWS) computer program development and the Aegis Combat Systems Engineering Agent (CSEA) since the inception of the Aegis Program in 1969.  This contractor is a highly specialized source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements for a functional removable Aegis adaptation at the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) by CY13 in support of the test and evaluation necessary to achieve an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in CY14.  As a result of LM MS2’s involvement in the Aegis BMD Program, it is the only source that currently possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the systems requirements to perform the work contemplated herein.  No source, other than LM MS2 has access to the proprietary data, resident expertise, and resources to perform the work described herein.  This expertise cannot be obtained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring substantial duplicative costs and risk.  The anticipated period of performance for the effort is up to 10 years after contract award.  The proposed contract action is for system engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) as implemented in FAR 6.302.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly.  See Note 22.

<DESC>PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PDF BAA 100339 FOR COMPLETE DETAILS

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport hereby solicits proposals through the use of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (see FAR 35.016) for a state-of-the-art "adaptable telemetry" approach that: (1) can accommodate both high frequency (HF) and medium frequency (MF) Submarine sonar hull arrays with very large numbers of channels; (2) requires a minimum of  application/sensor specific tailoring to maintain performance; and (3) employs open systems/commercial standards to facilitate multi-vendor and foreign source integration. 
Telemetry is defined as electronics and associated packaging and interconnection between the output of the acoustic sonar array sensor elements and the inboard processors. Telemetry includes, but may not be limited to the following: analog and digital signal conditioning, data transport and concentration, physical interconnect, and all associated power distribution.	
This BAA seeks innovative architectures for adaptable telemetry.  Submissions should address the performance areas indentified in Section 1.3 to design an adaptable telemetry architecture with broad applicability to HF and MF submarine hull arrays.  Performance tradeoffs within and between areas should be considered.  Submissions should also address a detailed design that conforms to the proposed telemetry architecture to demonstrate a specific hull array application.  
Telemetry architecture is defined as the abstract conceptual design that defines the structure and behavior of hull array telemetry systems.   A detailed design that conforms to the architecture is defined as an instantiation.
Submissions should emphasize open systems/commercial standards as this adaptable telemetry will be integrated with multiple domestic vendor and/or foreign sourced acoustic sonar arrays and inboard processors.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with the modernization of the John Weld Peck Federal Building. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project. The 10 story Peck Building, located at 550 Main Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, was completed in 1964. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of repairs to the building exterior, stripping and painting of the building penthouse, and the replacement of the building windows and roof. Interior improvements consist of replacement of the fire alarm system, improvements to the existing fire sprinkler system, upgrading of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, the addition of a new emergency generator and the replacement of interior door hardware to ensure ADA compliance. 
 
The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described above through concepts, design development and construction documentation. The design A/E may also provide inspection services and shop drawing review during the construction stage of the project.

The scope of the Architect/Engineering Services required under this proposed contract may include, but is not limited to, the following: preparation of design documents consisting of drawings and specifications; evaluation, design, and document preparation to be used in providing clear direction to the CM team; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Peck Federal Building; specifications and cost estimates; site investigation; analysis of previous investigative reports; shop drawing approval and construction site inspection; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The Government will not allow payment for travel, living expenses, or computer hookups for the prime, subcontractor, or any consultants for purposes of responding to this RFQ.

THIS PROCUREMENT IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS ONLY in accordance with the small business competitive demonstration program. The small business size standard for this procurement, under NAICS code 541310, is $4,000,000 based on average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years. Small, Women-owned, Minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, Small disadvantaged, and Service disabled veteran owned businesses are encouraged to participate. 

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the Architectural and Engineering capabilities of the A/E Design Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a modern high-rise structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) dated no earlier than 12 months from the date of this synopsis. OFFERORS MUST SUBMIT THE SF330 FORM, SF254 AND SF255 FORMS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in exterior building repairs, HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, and development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century buildings.

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. 

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of 40-year old buildings. Also, focus on coordinating complex multiphase construction in office space, including sensitive and secured spaces such as the Federal agency spaces.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples of similar projects for the Lead Designer.

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed Stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area, which is the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described in this announcement are invited to respond by submitting six (6) complete copies of the entire Stage I submittal including the portfolios, SF330 (Information just of the Design firm), and a letter of interest identifying this announcement by solicitation number arriving at the designated location no later than October 8, 2004 by 2:00 p.m. (Central Time).

If applicable, each SF330 submitted should make the following certification as the last entry in Block 30: “I hereby certify the firm (or joint firm) and consultants listed for this project meet the geographic locations stated in the FBO announcement for this solicitation.”  A follow-up listing of firms to be selected for Stage II and interviews will appear as a modification to this synopsis posting.  All other non-selected A/E firms and consultants interested in participating on the design team should submit a one page letter of interest only, which will be forwarded on to the short-listed firms. FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. Award of this contract is contingent upon receipt of design funds and successful negotiation of a reasonable fee.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A-E firms will not be reimbursed for expenses or efforts under Stage I and/ or Stage II submissions.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis to provide logistical and administrative support to the CMHS Child, Adolescent and Family Branch (CAFB) and initiatives related to the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program (short title: Child Mental Health Initiative (CMHI)), such as the Council for Collaboration and Coordination (CCC) and the Building Bridges Initiative. An additional focus is the implementation of a culturally competent technical assistance program for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribes, tribal organizations and other CMHI grantees serving the AI/AN populations. 

Under the CMHI program, at any given time there are 60-70 communities (states, counties, cities, US Territories and Indian Tribes/Tribal organizations) that are funded through six-year cooperative agreements to: implement (in one or more communities) a broad array of community-based and family-driven and youth-guided services for children with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental challenges; and enable communities to develop comprehensive local systems of care which coordinate and integrate services across mental health, health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, substance abuse treatment and other agencies, as appropriate.  Of the 60-70 funded communities, there are an estimated 8-10 communities that are AI/AN Tribes, tribal organizations or cities subcontracting with Urban Indian Programs to serve AI/AN populations in an urban setting. The contractor will provide culturally appropriate technical assistance to the AI/AN grant communities during each year of the contract.  

IMPORTANT NOTE: Section 565(b)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) establishes the statutory authority for the provision of technical assistance for grants authorized under Section 561(a) of the PHS Act.  Section 565(b) provides that the Secretary, DHHS, may provide technical assistance directly or through grants to, or contracts with, public and non-profit private entities.  Accordingly, in order to be considered eligible to compete for this procurement, offerors must be either public or non-profit private entities.
 
There are two goals of this contract. Part 1 is to provide logistical and administrative support to the CAFB. Tasks to support the CAFB include conducting meetings and initiatives related to the CMHI, such as the CCC and the Building Bridges Initiative. The contractor will be required to maintain a master list of attendees for these initiatives, and coordinate meetings and conference calls of the various workgroups and the groups as a whole. This contract will provide logistical support for mandated Federal site visits to grantee communities, and facilitate other travel as requested. The contract will also support speech writing, the development of PowerPoint slides and white papers for the CAFB. Up to four (4) policy papers (time-limited studies, literature reviews, and analysis of secondary data sets) which highlight special data and relevant topics concerning mental health may be commissioned over each year of the contract. The contractor will be required to secure consultants, as needed, to complement these efforts. 

Part 2 of the contract is to provide culturally competent, individual community-based and cross-site technical assistance to tribal CMHI grantees and others who serve American Indian/Alaska Native populations, including: at least one (1) technical assistance site visit per year for each AI/AN grant community, at least one (1) CMHI grantee meeting for AI/AN grantees per year, and developing collaborative relationships with national organizations and other contracted technical assistance providers for the CMHI Program.  The contract will also require information dissemination to tribal CMHI grantees, facilitation of one (1) meeting with tribal leaders and tribal mental health directors on systems of care and quality improvement activities.  The contract will require culturally competent technical assistance and community/organizational development strategies to: improve programs, policies and services to AI/AN children and youth with serious emotional challenges and their families so that they are appropriately served and treated in AI/AN communities; and promote the adoption/adaptation and implementation of the CMHI systems of care values and approaches which promote mental health for children and youth with mental health challenges and their families in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities.

The anticipated period of performance for this contract is a base period of 12 months, plus four (4) 12-month option periods.

<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations System (FAR) 5.204 and is not a Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation (RFP/RFQ). The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is finalizing its requirements for managed wireless products and services as described in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) that accompanies this announcement, and intends to solicit proposals from small businesses. To ensure that our requirements are accurately and clearly stated, reflect processes and procedures that are consistent with commercial best practices, and create an adequately competitive marketplace, we seek industry comments and questions on our draft Statement of Work. Please provide your review comments and questions to TSA by December 4, 2009 at Wireless-RFI@tsa.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>TSA's Office of Information Technology (OIT) oversees the procurement, delivery, operation and maintenance of all information technology for the agency. Included among the broad responsibilities is a program that provides wireless communications services to staff in locations in the United States (including its territories, possessions, and protectorates) and throughout the world. OIT seeks a Small Business Contractor to implement and manage a comprehensive wireless program that includes the acquisition of equipment and equipment related services; the procurement, repackaging, and reselling of wireless services; and the attendant program management services. TSA's present contractor manages a program that currently fields 14,911 devices. The new contractor will be required to successfully transition the existing devices and their attendant services to their contract without a loss in service. The contractor shall implement and use best business practices and continuous improvement to provide TSA an effective and efficient program that includes, but is not limited to, cellular wireless account consolidation and rate plan optimization, requisitioning and provisioning support, invoice reconciliation and expense management, service and equipment asset accountability, and management reporting (see the Draft SOW) in a performance-based contract.</p>
<p>The information being sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation for TSA to issue a solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in the preparation or submittal of responses to this notice. All costs associated with responding to this notice will be borne solely by the responding party. At the present time, there is no solicitation for these requirements. Should the Government issue a solicitation for these requirements, it will be posted, and made available to the public via the Government Point of Entry (GPE), https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of all interested parties to routinely monitor the GPE for additional information pertaining to this requirement. TSA will not keep a list of firms responding to this notice; accordingly, interested parties will not be placed on a source list, receive individual notices of updates to the GPE, or receive separate notification of the release of a solicitation. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>POC Nina Patel, USTDA<br />1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600<br />Arlington, VA 22209-3901<br />Tel: (703) 875-4357<br />Fax: (703) 875-4009 <br />***Please do not contact contracts office***<br /><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Dr. Tarek Ali Sharaf, Chairman Of Med<br />Mechanical &amp; Electrical Department<br />3 Taftesh El-Rai Street<br />Shobra Elmezalat<br />Cairo, Egypt<br />202 22 06 92 93 <br />
<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance for a supplementary pump station for the Nile.</p>
<p>The TA is intended to address the critical need for water resources in the West Delta region of the Nile. The successful implementation of the project will promote pumping systems to supplement the water supply to ensure MWRI meets the critical water needs of the region.</p>
<p>Most of the agriculture in the Arab Republic of Egypt occurs in approximately 3% of the country's land area primarily in the Nile Valley and the Delta Region. Agriculture is a vital part of Egypt's economy and provides employment for approximately 29% of the population, makes up 14% of the country's GDP and 35% of its exports. Accordingly, massive irrigation projects have been built to support the population and sustain the agriculture sector. The Ministry for Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) currently operates 1,650 pumping stations throughout Egypt to support the growing Egyptian population.</p>
<p>In addition to the urban growth around the cities such as Cairo and Alexandria, the growth around the thousands of small villages in the Nile Valley and the Delta has resulted in the reduction of agricultural land. To compensate for this loss, the Government of Egypt (GOE) has supported commercial farmers by reclaiming desert lands. In particular, the GOE has identified an area of approximately 107,000 hectares in the West Delta of the Nile that has experienced significant agricultural growth and supports a population of some 500,000, many of whom are engaged in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>The West Delta Region is irrigated based on two main water sources: surface water from the Nile River through a series of water channels starting from diversion canals to the branch canals, and distributaries and ground water based in the aquifer in the West Delta. However, the rapid growth in the region has excessively depleted ground water resources while also deteriorating water quality (e.g., increased salinity).</p>
<p>To address the water needs in the West Delta, the installation of a new pump station to transport water from the Nile to the West Delta region has been funded by the World Bank. This plan, to be implemented by MWRI is designed to offset the withdrawal of groundwater with surface water from the Nile. This project will not only increase the agricultural production, but will also provide additional employment opportunities and expand residential land for Egypt's rapidly expanding population.</p>
<p>In addition to the World Bank project, a supplementary pump station is required to transport water from the Rosetta Branch of the Nile to replace the abstracted water from the World Bank pumping project. The supplementary pump station will not only help replace the diverted water, but will also be used to improve the irrigation situation in other areas in the West Delta. The TA involves a technical, financial, economic and environmental assessment of the supplementary pump station in the West Delta region of the Nile. The TA will involve the preparation of the preliminary design and equipment specifications as well as the bid package components to allow MWRI to launch an international tender.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $277,774 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm NOON, JUNE 24, 2010 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Executive Search Services in Support of the Office of Financial Stability (OFS) Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
<p><br />This is a sources sought notice. This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Financial Stability (OFS) is responsible for the management and administration of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) which was established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Act). The purpose of the Act is to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) with the authorities and facilities to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system of the United States. In addition, the Secretary is directed to ensure that such authorities are used in a manner that protects home values, college funds, retirement accounts, and life savings; preserves homeownership and promotes jobs and economic growth; maximizes overall returns to the taxpayers of the United States; and provides public accountability for the exercise of such authority. By acquiring, managing, and orderly liquidating the troubled assets over time, the Treasury seeks to improve the capital positions of financial institutions, reduce risk premiums in the market, improve liquidity and credit extension in the financial system, increase investor confidence, and provide market participants with more price transparency. The portfolio mandate and specific investment strategies may change over time but will always be consistent with these policy goals.</p>
<p>The operational goals of OFS are to:</p>
<p>1. Ensure the overall stability and liquidity of the financial system.<br />2. Prevent avoidable foreclosures and help preserve homeownership.<br />3. Protect taxpayer interests.<br />4. Promote transparency.</p>
<p>OFS administers equity and debt securities purchased from financial institutions through the following TARP program that are in scope for this source sought notice:</p>
<p>&#9642; Capital Purchase Program (CPP)</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) may have an upcoming requirement for use of the services of one or several executive search firms that would be capable of identifying a candidate or a qualified pool of candidates to serve on the Boards of Directors of several Qualified Financial Institutions (QFIs) in which Treasury has made prior investments. The open directorships may potentially be located in cities and towns across the 50 United States and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Treasury is in particular interested in firms that would have an ability to identify qualified individuals to fill positions in small to medium tier sized banks (approximately $100million - $10billion in asset size) located across the country, and create a pool of qualified candidates from which Treasury can select potential board members as necessary. Treasury may in certain cases be seeking to identify specific, qualified individuals ahead of an actual opening, so that if an opening is created, that individual may be nominated in a timely manner. While Treasury may have the ability to appoint members to certain boards, compensation of said members will be paid by the QFI to the individual directly.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of the interest, capabilities, and qualifications of prospective offerors in support of the financial service area described above. Treasury is particularly interested in understanding the capabilities and qualifications of interested small business concerns, including woman and minority owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB). Treasury's choice of solicitation vehicle and acquisition strategy will depend in part upon the responses to this notice of all firms, including small businesses.</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to provide a written response to this notice which is limited to a maximum of 3 pages with a minimum font size of 10 point, one page covering all information necessary to address items 1 - 4 below, and two pages maximum to describe the capabilities of each search firm. The response should reference the following items:</p>
<p>1) The vendor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address; <br />2) The vendor's small business size status, including whether the vendor is a woman owned, minority owned, or SDVOSB firm; <br />3) A statement indicating if vendor is currently a GSA Schedule holder, and, if so, identification of GSA contract number and corresponding schedule identification number.<br />4) A statement as to whether the firm is interested in working as a prime contractor or a subcontractor; <br />5) A description of the search firm's capabilities and past experiences in placing members in both publically traded and privately held/managed financial institutions, specifically those of small to medium size as described above. Special attention should be directed to the search firm's ability to source qualified candidates with backgrounds in financial workouts, turnarounds or restructurings. <br />6) A description of the geographic scope of region(s) of the United States that the search firm is capable of providing search services for. <br />7) A general outline and listing of the billing or compensation scheme used by the search firm for its own reimbursement, to include any price break points based upon internal criteria such as the size of the QFI at which placement is being made or the geographic location of the open position.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561312. The small business size standard, based upon the NAICS code, is $7,000,000.</p>
<p>Treasury anticipates that any resulting solicitation will require offerors to provide information on the capabilities of their firms, key personnel, resources, past performance, and pricing. All firms will be required to propose an organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) mitigation plan. Treasury expects to award contracts to the firm or combination of firms which represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Interested firms must respond to this sources sought notice <strong>no later than 2:00 P.M. ET on April 22, 2010.</strong> Responses and information in response to this notice <strong>must be sent via e-mail to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OFSESS@do.treas.gov</span></strong>. <strong>Telephone inquiries shall be considered non-responsive</strong>.

Presently, DSCR uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ worldwide demand for roller bearing and bushing products.  DSCR’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry’s best practices and implement a solution which assures readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DSCR’s goal is to effectively reduce lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

Scope of Project

This initiative contains DSCR managed NSNs in Federal Stock Groups (FSGs) 3110/3120.  

•	FSG 3110-Roller Bearings (Unmounted)
•	FSG 3120-Bushings
•	FSG 3130-Roller Bearings (Mounted)

Anticipated Scope:

-Delivery of items to DLA depots or directly to DLA’s customers in accordance with delivery terms.

-Collaboration with DLA on projected and anticipated demands

-Procurement/Purchasing-All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.  Responsible for all subcontracts.

-Data management-to include interoperability with industry and government systems.

RFI Questions

1) Universe of items (13,987 NSNs within the three identified FSGs)

A.   How would you recommend the universe of items within these three FSGs be set up (i.e. when looking at these 3 FSGs, do you envision multiple contracts per FSG)?  Should the FSGs be combined into one contract or should we solicit and award separate contract for each of the FSGs or some suggested combination of them?

2) Collaboration

A.  How would you recommend collaborating on anticipated demand to reduce ALT/PLT/Lead time in response to changes in demand?  

B. What is the optimum length of contract to reduce costs and improve availability?

C. What is the maximum firm fixed price period length?  Beyond the firm fixed price period what is best method of adjusting pricing, price redetermination or EPA?  At what frequencies?
 
D. What method would you utilize to manage low value, nonrecurring demand items?

E.  Can you support both DLA direct (DLA stocked) support and Customer Direct (DLA direct customer) requirements?

3)Packaging/Marking Requirements

A) Do you repackage items as a part of your supplier function?

B.   Are you familiar with and can you comply with military packaging requirement for both roller bearings and bushings?  (Some roller bearings require clean room packaging-Mil Detail 197)

C.  Are you familiar with and can you comply with military product marking requirements?

4) Data Management

B.  Please identify whether your company is a manufacturer, non-manufacturer, or other?

C.  What percentage of your product line is manufactured by your company?

D.  DLA is required to purchase roller bearings as a domestic product.  If just one component of a bearing assembly is manufactured outside the U.S. or Canada, the entire assembly is considered to be a foreign bearing.  What method would you use to actively identify and notify DLA of items that change from domestic to foreign and back?

E.  What method would you utilize to reduce the number of foreign bearings and to increase the purchase of domestic bearings? 

F.  How do you recommend managing Critical Safety Items/First Article Testing items/Product Verification Testing items/Production Lot Testing items in a Long Term Agreement?

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport will hold an Industry Day Wednesday, May 5, 2010 to present and discuss Navy's requirement for an Undersea Warfare Training Range to be located offshore of Jacksonville, FL and designated USWTR(EC)JAX.    Naval forces must train to operate in the littoral environments where regional conflicts are most likely to occur.  These shallow water environments limit U.S. Navy sensor performance, weapons utilization, and tactical maneuvering. The capability is required to provide USW training and assessment under these adverse environmental conditions for air, surface, and subsurface vehicles.  USWTR(EC)JAX will provide this training on the east coast of the U.S.
The present effort addresses the system production engineering, integration, manufacturing, installation, and checkout of an Ocean Sensor Subsystem (OSS) in water depths ranging from approximately 120 - 1200 ft (36 - 366 meters), a Sea-Shore Interface (SSI), and related Shore Electronics Subsystems (SES) for a new 500 square nautical mile (SNM) range capability approximately 50 NM east of Mayport Naval Station, FL.  The full range will be instrumented in two phases.  Phase 1 will provide the infrastructure, trunk cabling, and an initial instrumented area of approximately 200 SNM.  The second phase will instrument the remaining 300 SNM area.
The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide information on the engineering requirements, project contract type, program phasing, and the projected release date of the Request for Proposals (RFP).

NAVAIR, Patuxent River will host this Industry Day at Admiral Moffet Building (Building 2272), room 148 (PMA-275 conference room), 47123 Buse Rd, NAS Patuxent River, MD 20670.  The Industry Day briefings will take place from 1200 to 1330 local time.  Check-in of attendees will start at 1100.
Attendees must register by April 28, 2010.  To register, please contact William Hurley at 401-832-1571 or william.hurley@navy.mil.  Attendance is limited to a maximum of three (3) representatives per company.

<DESC>PURPOSE

This is a Department of State (DoS) Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) only. Contractors are requested to read and respond to the below and attached requirements accordingly. The responses from this RFI may be used as market research to determine an acquisition strategy for anticipated competitive acquisition(s) in the upcoming months.

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) notice is to survey the vendor community for potential sources who can provide an idea generating software and services required by the Bill of Materials below. Detailed specifications of each item are attached. 

PARTICIPATION IN THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS VOLUNTARY, NO COMPENSATION WILL BE PROVIDED. ALL QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING VIA EMAIL TO ROGERSAN@STATE.GOV. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE; THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. NO AWARD WILL BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF RESPONSES RECEIVED TO THIS RFI.

RESPONSE FORMAT

Responses must be submitted electronically, formatted in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel (any version). Margins must be 1" on all sides, to print on 8 1/2" x 11" paper. Typeface must be Times New Roman, 12 point font. Responses should be specific to the Bill of Materials and the attached specifications. There is no page limitation, but respondents are cautioned to keep marketing materials and non-specific information to a minimum. No responses shall be accepted via US Mail or Fax.

RESPONSE CONTENT

Responses should be concise, yet detailed, and include the Contractor's statement of interest, capabilities statement, and specific commercial of the shelf (COTS) products that the respondent could deploy to fulfill the requirement if a solicitation were to be issued. Responses may include the attached specification tables, indicating what product (brand, model#, etc) the respondent suggests to meet such future requirements. Respondents may notate each detailed specification on the tables, indicating whether the product suggested would meet the requirement or not, and whether there is any other technical consideration, option, exception, etc that would apply. Respondents are encouraged to include in their response any questions or additional information that they would require prior to submitting a quote, in the event that a solicitation is issued.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ISSUED BY THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (NRL) FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NO AWARDS WIL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. HOWEVER, RESPONSES MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR A FUTURE ACQUISITION.</p>
<p>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will not issue paper copies of this request. The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) programs. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request. <br /><br />This Announcement issued by NRL solicits industry and academic sources to express their capability to provide sensors for use on Navy ships and submarines. The subject sensors will be used to measure and report strength and intensity changes in waterborne electric fields that result from the interaction between the cathodic protection systems that protect the platforms underwater hull and free-flood spaces. These sensors shall have the capacity of measuring the magnitude and/or direction of the electrochemical current flow traveling between the free-flood spaces and the seawater space surrounding a ship. <br /><br />These new sensors will have high reliability and long mean time between failures (MTBF) of greater than 14 years. The sensors be developed under the FNC will address the need for measurement regarding the interaction between free flood (internal) cathodic protection systems and the vessels exterior underwater hull Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system. Specifically, the sensors will provide data concerning the direction of electrochemical DC current interaction between the two spaces. This information can be provided by means of direct DC flux current measurement or by measurement of electrochemical field strength or other device. Additionally, the final sensors will be utilized to assess the corrosion condition of the free-flood spaces and should posse capability to measure electrochemical potential or utilize other global corrosion sensing technology. Spatial conditions for global sensing are no more than one sensor per 5,000 ft3 of tank volume. The present targeted sensor resolution of interest for electrochemical fields is +/-10 micro-volt DC and for direct flux current density measurement of +/- 2mA/ft2 DC. Electrochemical corrosion potential sensor should of resolution and accuracy of +/-1mVdc. Each sensor component will have data output capability to provide feedback to the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system controller.<br /><br />Contractors are encouraged to consider methodologies that have not been listed but that will achieve the desired goal of measuring the magnitude and direction of DC electrochemical current flow. Contractors can submit white papers on the entire Dual-Use sensor or on one of the key sensor components, such as the DC current sensor.<br /><br />In concert with consideration of new materials and designs, the Navy has also established goals which will also govern the development options. These are established with the intent of making prototype sensors available to the fleet for demonstration purposes during Government Fiscal Year 2011 with a follow-on demonstration in Fiscal Year 2012. <br /><br />The final sensor package will ultimately be designed for permanent installation aboard an active Navy ship, below the waterline, and meet the defined MTBF. Sensors shall be able to operate under all known variable conditions of service of Navy ships and submarines including wet/dry cycles, high humidity, temperature, conductivity/salinity, and pressure. Sensors shall be ruggedized to withstand vibration, Grade B shock, Navy EMI specification, implosion and function properly in an industrial ship environment. <br /><br />The size and weight of sensors are an important consideration and shall be minimized. Additionally, installation and replacement shall not be burdensome and ideally, replacement accomplished underwater. Cabling to and from sensors to the ICCP system shall be minimized.<br /><br />Collaboration and teaming between sensor/ material / process developers is encouraged to achieve the technical goals and manufacturing capability. <br /><br />An Industry Day will be held on May 19, 2010 to provide additional information and discussion on this topic. Details and registration information may be found at https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=595. Attendance is voluntary and not required to respond to this RFI; however, registration is required to attend the Industry Day. Attendees at the industry day are allowed to bring a single poster (not larger than 3 feet tall by 2 feet wide) to post in the industry day venue. These posters are for the purpose of announcing proposer capabilities and desires for teaming. Time will be allowed during the industry day for potential offerors to interface with other interested commercial and academic parties.<br /><br />To minimize costs to potential contractors in responding to the subject announcement, each contractor is encouraged to submit an initial White Paper of no more than five (5) pages in length for each specific technology offered.

The subject system should include an integrated shaft current sensing capability, electrical impedance to ground minimization, shaft current control capability and electrical contacts for rotary components such as shafts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As discussed in more detail below, NRL seeks to develop a new ASGS design, with a new integrated shaft current sensing and shaft current control capability.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />This new system will have increased reliability and mean time between failures (MTBF) compared to the ASGS currently employed in the fleet, thus reducing repair/life cycle costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the system to be developed under the FNC will address the problems of (1) intermittent or inconsistent electrical and/or mechanical contact between the ASGS system and the rotating shaft, (2) poor reliability/maintainability of the system; particularly contact or wear components (3) weight and physical size of the system. The new system must have the capability of sensing corrosion and corrosion control current flowing down the shaft.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />The legacy ASGS system uses a system of spring-loaded conductive brushes that ride on a contact ring fitted to the rotating shaft. The new system may use a similar arrangement or an alternative arrangement that provides a greater and more consistent degree of electrical contact and a reduced maintenance burden. NRL is particularly interested in systems that provide grounding through contact with no wear components or provide non-contact grounding approaches.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />The complete ASGS is defined as all components required to ground the shaft of the vessel to the hull and to measure the electrical current passing through the shaft to ground (ship's structure), though responders to this RFI may only have applicable technology to a component of the complete system. These include the following: shaft electrical continuity hardware (all components mounted/attached to the shaft, both inside and/or outside of the vessel's hull), current sensor hardware (components required to measure the shaft current at either an inboard or outboard location relative to the main shaft bearings and to connect the sensor with the control/monitoring unit) and control/ monitoring unit electronics (components needed to monitor, record and provide feedback to the onboard Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />Responders to the RFI are encouraged to consider novel materials and material treatments, new electrical continuity concepts and designs to achieve the desired goals. These may include brushless systems or advanced brush designs incorporating shaft surface treatments to replace existing shaft-fitted slip rings. Contractors can submit white papers on the entire ASGS system or on key components, such as the current sensor or electrical grounding system.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />The advanced ASGS system shall maintain a stable ground shaft to hull voltage difference of at least &plusmn;2 mV at 100 Amperes (DC) with an objective of less than &plusmn;1 mV at 100 ADC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be low weight, provide digital Ethernet output of data, have a long service life (40 x 10<sup>6</sup> rotations and 15 years, minimum) with straightforward, periodic, maintenance, contain no heavy metals and minimize particulate generation. Both repairs and maintenance should be completed by depot (pier-side) level activities, though repairs by sailors should be planned as a possibility. In addition, the system shall provide the capability to measure currents in a shaft in both the DC and AC spectrums with a threshold resolution of 0.1A and an objective of 0.01A from 0 to 1000Hz.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />In concert with consideration of new materials and designs, the Navy has also established goals which will also govern the development options. These are established with the intent of constructing a prototype or assembly of individual component technologies for testing on a land based test stand in FY11 and a full scale unit available to the Fleet for demonstration purposes by the Government in Fiscal Year 2014 (Starting October 2013). The prototype system shall have an objective of maintaining a stable ground shaft to hull voltage of less than &plusmn;1 mV at 100 ADC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system shall demonstrate a mean-time-between failure of greater than 4000 hours, continuous operation, on a test stand with an objective of more than 8000 hours on a test stand. The system total weight shall be less than 500 lbs with a target of less than 250 lbs.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />Collaboration and teaming between sensor/ material / process developers is encouraged to achieve the technical goals and manufacturing capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />An Industry Day will be held on May 19, 2010 to provide additional information and discussion on this topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Details and registration information may be found at <a href="https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=595">https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=595</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>.

<DESC>USAMRAA/USAMMDA  has a requirement for a 100 vials of Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP (Pentostam) containing 100 mg of perntavalent antimony per ml and each vial contains 100 ml.  The product will be manufactured in March 2010 (approximate) with 3 year expiration date.  USAMRAA intends to procure a sole source requirement for the supplies from the following organization:  Glaxo Smith Kline Export Ltd., 980 Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom.  These supplies cannot be provided by any other organization and as such, it is in the best interest of the Government to obtain it from Glaxo Smith Kline Export Ltd.  This requirement is a sole source contract based on only one source being reasonably available (FAR 13.106(b)(1).  The Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP is a medical drug used under the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) Application #14,150 for use in humans.  The Office of the Surgeon General sponsored IND protocol is written and approved by the FDA specifically for Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP (Pentostam) produced by Glaxo Smith Kline Export Ltd.  Therefore, no other source of Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP is authorized by the FDA under this IND.  The U. S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), as the sponsors representative, has overall responsibility for management of the protocol and the product.  Pentostam is the IND product used to treat U. S. troops for Leishmaniasis in an active research protocol at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).  Leishmaniasis is a protozoal disease transmitted by sand flies and is endemic in many parts of the world including the Middle East, Southwest Asia and Africa as well as Central and South America.  Infected humans may develop cutaneous, mucocutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis.  The disease is a medical threat for military soldiers assigned in endemic areas and a major cause of morbidity in soldiers deployed to the Middle East.  Glaxo Smith Kine Export Ltd. is the manufacturer and distributor.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.  No solicitation will be made available.  Interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement may submit information about their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to:  MAJ Bryan K. Preer,  Contract Specialist via email at bryan.preer@us.army.mil no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, 19 April 2010.  Submission should be emailed as either a PDF or Microsoft Office attachment.  Submissions should be on company letterhead and include companys name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax number, DUNS Number, CAGE Code.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1).  This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures (FAR Part 13).  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR><BR>BRYAN K.

The software suite shall contain chart management functionality that identifies and reports delinquent and deficient chart documentation as appropriate (this shall be configurable).  There shall be the capability to generate management reporting at the facility, VISN and enterprise levels.

Market research shows that Rigaku is the only Contractor authorized to provide these support services, and that any services performed on Rigaku products by outside parties will render any warranties with the associated products null and void. Below is a description of the services to be procured:</p>
<p><br />One Year Standard Service Contract<br />Coverage includes: Parts, Labor, and Software Support<br />8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday - Friday, excluding holidays<br />Hardware Covered:<br /><br />Micromax 007; SN: BD304603<br /><br />R-Axis IV ++; SN: BD2781N<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes CrystalClear &amp; Structure Studio Support<br /><br />P-SAX; SN: IN25369</p>
<p><br />The NAICS Code is 541519 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Rigaku Americas Corporation for this requirement. <br /><br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized by Rigaku Americas Corporation to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice.

<DESC>Sole Source Notice of Intent - Global Chemical Data, Inc.<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Safety, Health and Environmental Division, intends to negotiate with Global Chemical Data, Inc, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source, for the renewal annual subscription to the CHEMWATCH database.
<p>Renewal of annual subscription to the ChemWatch database hosted at: http://nist.chemwatch.us for the period from September 15, 2010 through September 14, 2011. Chemwatch provides chemical information products and services for the safe and compliant production, use and transport of hazardous materials globally.<br />Chemwatch is an ISO 9000 quality certified company. Chemwatch is a database of more than 180,000 independently researched and unbiased MSDSs in a standard format. In addition to 40,000 pure substances, Chemwatch also contains 140,000 other materials from common cleaning agents to drugs, paints, infectious substances and even explosives. It is, by far, the largest database of its kind and has grown with quarterly updates for the past 20 years. Chemwatch serves as the core of hazcom, first response, safety and research for more than 3000 organizations and 10,000 sites globally.</p>
<p>The NIST Safety Health and Environment Division (SHED) proposed to purchase an annual subscription for access to the ChemWatch database of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs). ChemWatch is a web based database. The subscription allows access to any NIST employee. This service is extremely valuable in providing hazard information to NIST employees. An MSDS is required by OSHA regulations for each chemical used at NIST. The chemical inventory software currently in use at NIST, CISPro, has a direct link to ChemWatch. This allows NIST user to enter chemicals into the CISPro inventory and directly access MSDS's in ChemWatch at the same time. This eliminates the duplicate entry of data and makes the assessment of hazard for the chemical inventory at NIST much easier.<br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized to provide these before April 14, 2010 at 12:00 pm EST. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates their authorization to meet these requirements. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Janice.Moten@Nist.Gov. 301 975 6307</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - This is a special notice for use of a brand name product specified in solicitation no. N9430100001 issued April 9, 2010 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The solicitation specifies the use of the following brand name product:  NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement manufactured by Soil Stabilization Products Company, Inc, Merced, California.   The solicitation was issued as a request for proposal to promote competition for a contractor to resurface the Spruce Mill Trail within Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, Vancouver, Washington in accordance with the solicitation project specifications.  The contractor will be responsible for the purchase, delivery, and application of the specified brand name product, to create a natural-looking paved pathway (Spruce Mill Trail).  The end result will be a new pathway that matches the existing pathways at the Historic Site using the same product and method of application as was used previously for the purpose of maintaining a cohesive trail system.   Comments and questions regarding this special notice may be directed to Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, at phaedra_fuller@nps.gov.  Include your business name, qualifications, and point of contact.  All comments received before April 19, 2010 will be considered.  Use of the brand name product is justified as follows:
1.  IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  U.S. Department of Interior, National Park Service, Fort Vancouver National Historic Site  (FOVA), 612 East Reserve Street, Vancouver, Washington  98661
2.  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:    Incorporate the use of a brand name product in Solicitation no. N9430100001, whereby a firm, fixed-price construction contract will be awarded to a single contractor responsible for supply, delivery, and application of a specified brand name resin pavement mix that will be used to resurface the Spruce Mill Trail within Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, in the same color, texture, and application process as previously applied to other trails within the park.  The Spruce Mill Trail will match existing trails to maintain a cohesive trail system within the historic site. The nature of this project is a follow-on requirement.  The request for proposal will promote competition among contractors who will apply the material.  The material is brand name specific and will be a requirement of the solicitation. 
3.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE:    This acquisition is composed of two major elements which are incorporated into a single solicitation:  Construction and Supply.  The solicitation is full and open competition, prepared as a request for proposal, specifying the use of a brand name product.  A construction contract will be awarded to a single contractor responsible for the purchase, delivery, and application of the brand name product, to create a natural-looking paved pathway.  The end result will be a new pathway that closely matches the existing pathways in the park, using the same brand name product and application process as was used previously for the purpose of maintaining a cohesive trail system. FOVA is located in an urban environment, in the city of Vancouver, WA, and nearby, just across the Columbia River, is Portland, OR.  FOVA hosts public events throughout the year, and during summer months some events, such as the Fourth of July, draw significantly large crowds.  FOVA was concerned about the number of visitors potentially impacting the site's natural landscape during the more popular events, and decided traffic flow was of major concern.  Historically, FOVA did not have paved roads or pathways.  In order to minimize visitor impact on the natural landscape, control the flow of traffic, and maintain a historic appearance, FOVA constructed a trail system in a manner and of a material that has as little visual impact on the overall landscape as possible.  The trails were designed to be wide, accommodating flow of visitor traffic in both directions, comply with ADA requirements, inter-connect at various route locations, and made of a strong, durable material.  Concrete paving material was considered, but there was concern about its flexibility, and potential for chipping and cracking in severe temperature fluctuations which are common to areas along the Columbia River.  Traditional hot mix asphalt was rejected for similar reasons in addition to its tendency to reflect heat during summer months.  In addition, FOVA concluded that a black/dark gray asphalt trail system would represent a stark color contrast to the Historic Site's natural landscape consisting of lighter brown colored dirt and existing vegetation.  In an earlier attempt to provide a non-intrusive trail surface (to both sub-surface archaeological resources and the cultural landscape) FOVA utilized a decomposed granite mixture with oly tar.  This mixture proved unacceptable and did not bond well, given the amount of foot traffic and water.  FOVA later discovered NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement mix which worked well and held up under large amounts of traffic and moisture.  NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement mix is manufactured by Soil Stabilization Products Company, Inc.  The resin pavement mix produces a flexible pavement that displays the natural coloration and texture of the aggregate material used in the mix formulation.  The mix formulation is specific to FOVA.  FOVA provided aggregate samples matching local soil color to the manufacturer and the manufacturer designed a specific color-match formula to the aggregate which it used in the original application.  
4.  AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY:    41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5.  A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:    NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement was originally purchased and applied at various trails at FOVA, determined to be an appropriate all-weather pavement, ADA accessible, with a smooth joint-free running surface similar to asphalt pavement but with a more environmentally friendly composition, and color-appropriate in FOVA's natural landscape (met aesthetic requirement).  The solicitation for this project specifies the contractor supply, delivery, and install (apply) more of the same resin paving material, using the manufacturer's recommended method for application, matched to FOVA's existing trail system, in an effort to create a visually cohesive inter-connected trail system.  FOVA's five biggest concerns when originally choosing the trail system surface material were (a) color, (b) heat absorption, (c) stability for ADA/accessibility, (d) strength, believing strength would also indicate flexibility for chipping/cracking in temperature fluctuations, and (e) overall durability (longevity).  NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement was the only product found on the market at the time, that met the Government's requirements in all five areas.  
(a)  COLOR.  NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement mix produces a flexible pavement that displays the natural coloration and texture of the aggregate material used in the mix formulation.  The mix formulation is specific to FOVA.  FOVA provided aggregate samples to the manufacturer and the manufacturer designed a specific color-match formula to the aggregate which it used in the original application (original procurement) and then retained the formula for supplying on future FOVA projects.  
(b)  HEAT ABSORPTION.   NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement Resin Pavement is the ideal for new pavement installations where the relationship of pavement surface temperatures to human health, urban heat island effect and climate change are of concern.  The most important aspect of a cool pavement is its ability to reflect rather than absorb solar energy. Among the traditional pavement materials, concrete is the most reflective (high albedo), while black asphalt is the least reflective (low albedo) and most absorbent of solar energy. Typically NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement mixtures are formulated with light colored aggregate mixtures and consequently have high solar reflectance similar to concrete pavements. The differences in pavement surface temperatures between heat absorbent asphalt and highly reflective NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement can be significant. For example, utilizing an infrared thermometer during mid-August afternoon conditions (98F air temperatures) and measuring areas of pavement subject to full day sun exposure, the following pavement surface temperatures were recorded at a zoo facility in Washington, D.C. New Asphalt Pavement. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 145FWeathered Asphalt Pavement. . . . . . . . . . . 139FNaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement . . . 121FThe thermal conductivity of a pavement material is also relevant to its effectiveness as a cool pavement. A pavement that has high thermal conductivity, such as asphalt, will rapidly absorb solar energy and transmit heat through the pavement into the base course materials and subgrade soils below the pavement. As indicated by testing at the ASU SMART Materials Testing Facility, both asphalt and concrete pavment materials conduct heat more rapidly than NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement.  This means NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement has superior insulation value, or thermal resistance.  In combination with high solar reflectance, this advantage in thermal resistance makes NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement the standard for cool pavement technology.  Use of such pavement materials reduces heat absorption and radiance as required for a LEED Rating System Point toward "Green Building" Certification from the USGBC as per Credit SS 7.1 (Heat Island Effect) for light-colored/high albedo pavement.
(c) STABILITY FOR ADA/ACCESSIBILITY.  The US Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) is responsible for setting standards for wheelchair accessibility. The Access Board, in conjunction with the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, funded research to establish objective standards for surface characteristics that effect trail accessibility, including the relative "Firmness" and "Stability" of outdoor surfaces. A portable testing device, known as a Rotational Penetrometer, was developed as the basis of a general measurement system. This measurement system is able to evaluate the wet weather performance of various trail surfacing materials as well as dry weather performance. Field testing was conducted by Beneficial Designs, Inc., the firm that developed the Rotational Penetrometer measurement device. Both the asphalt and NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement surfaces provided very firm and very stable accessible surfaces in all weather conditions. In both dry and wet testing the NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement surface performed slightly better than the asphalt pavement surface in Firmness and Stability. Stability is a test value that translates into the pavement's resistance to distortion, displacement, shearing stresses, rutting and shoving. The resin pavement mixture performs as well or better than asphalt pavement in both wet and dry Rotational Penetrometer test evaluation of Firmness and Stability for use as an accessible outdoor surface. When NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement mixtures are compared with hot mix asphalt mixtures using the Marshall Stability Test, NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement specimens regularly exhibit Stability values higher than those typical for asphalt. NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement mixtures typically have significantly higher stability and flow test values than the hot mix asphalt pavement mixtures currently in nationwide use.
(d)  STRENGTH.  NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement specifies the resin mixture shall be suitable for vehicular and pedestrian traffic and with high strength such as that exhibited by hot mix asphaltic concrete mixtures.  Concrete, with its slab-like behavior and requirement for expansion joints, is classified and tested as a "rigid pavement" material. Hot mix asphalt pavement and NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement, with more elastic behavior and joint-free construction, are classified and tested as "flexible pavement" materials. The resin pavement manufacturer has a record of finished mixtures where TSRST test results demonstrated all of the low temperature performance criteria down to a temperature of -18.4 F (-28 C), where Resilient Modulus test results in accordance with ASTM D-4123 test methods demonstrating layer equivalency equal or better than conventional hot mix asphalt, and where Marshall Stability test results exceeded 10,000 pound stabilities when tested at 140 F (60 C) temperature.  Hot mix asphalt pavement specimens often break apart in pieces at the point where their peak stability is measured.  NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement specimens, with far higher binding strength and flexibility usually bulge to some small degree, rather than break apart, at the point where peak stability is achieved.  The NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement  binder technology is equally impressive in low temperature performance. The Thermal Stress Restrained Specimen Test (TSRST) is a standard test for evaluating hot mix asphalt pavement binders. With a requirement of -26 Centigrade performance typical for most of the hot mix asphalt pavement binders used in northern cold climate states, NaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement mixtures have performed effectively at temperatures as low as -40 Centigrade.	(e)  DURABLITY.  NaturalPAVE   XL Resin Pavement has proven wear resistance surface without the continuing generation of fine particle material from the full surface of the pavement installation and does not need ongoing or regular application of additional seal coat treatments in order to preserve the integrity of the pavement.  
6.  A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FAR SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES:    No exception applies.  Solicitation no. N9430100001 will be publicized at the Federal Business Opportunities website for 30 calendar days.  Concurrently with the solicitation, the agency will post a "special notice" indicating the Government's specification of a brand name product as a requirement in the above referenced solicitation. This justification will be included in the special announcement.
7.  A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:    The solicitation is a Request for Proposal, and all proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the Source Selection Plan.  Price reasonableness will be determined by competitive proposals received compared to the Government estimate and to each other, following the procedures specified in the Source Selection Plan.  
8.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (SEE FAR PART 10) AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:    FOVA did previously attempt to provide a non-intrusive trail surface (to both sub-surface archaeological resources and the cultural landscape) utilizing a decomposed granite mixture with oly tar.  This mixture proved unacceptable and did not bond well, given the amount of foot traffic and water.  FOVA later discovered NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement mix which worked well and held up under large amounts of traffic and moisture.  The existing trails at FOVA are paved with NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement manufactured by Soil Stabilization Prodcuts Company, Inc.  Other companies also make resin paving material.  However, the Project Manager has determined through on-line research that no other company has been found capable of providing an exact equivalent product, meeting the performance and functional specifications of NaturalPAVE  XL Resin Pavement.  
9.  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF A BRAND NAME PRODUCT:    None.
10.  A LISTING OF THE SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:   None.
11.  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME    ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED:    By announcing the Government's requirement of a brand name product, barriers to competition are removed.  In the event a company responds to the announcement they will be given consideration, but will be required to demonstratively prove that proposed products are substantially equivalent to the Government's requirement.  In future, if any other product is found equivalent to the specified brand name product, the restriction of the brand name will be removed, and the requirement will be competed. 
12.  CERTIFICATION:  I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for justifying the use of a brand name product) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:
I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief:

<p><br />002 - 85EA M4 Cannon Clock Timer<br /><br />&bull; Timer which automatically shuts propane cannons on and off as determined by the user of the cannon.</p>

Each breakout room must have a sufficient number of wall outlets to accommodate our heavy duty extension cords and/or power strips as needed to operate 15 laptop computers. The NLRB will consider an alternative proposal if all twelve breakout rooms are not available, but to be considered, the proposal must have privacy while maintaining close proximity for all breakout rooms. It is preferable for internet access in the meeting room to be restricted so that it is not available to participants in the meeting rooms; such as by utilizing a different password from the guest room.</p>
<p><strong>Part C: Food and Beverages Services <br />1.</strong> Awards Ceremony: Hor d'oeurves and a cash bar from 5:30 -7:30 p.m. are required for the Awards Ceremony Monday night.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Agency does not anticipate utilizing any real-time broadcast of the conference events. In the event the Agency determines that a recording of the events is desirable for future use on its website, or in any other venue, the Agency reserves the right to provide and operate its own equipment.</span></p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:</strong> <br />The NLRB intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The objective of the NLRB is to select the proposal that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the conference requirements covered in this solicitation. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</span></p>
<p>All offerors must confirm in their proposal that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong> <br />The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Evaluation. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Technical: <br /></strong>(a). Proposal will be evaluated for ability to provide all conference requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />(b). Lodging Rooms: their size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/WIFI connections).<br />(c). Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session and breakout rooms, location and office space; the atmosphere of the meeting rooms (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking, exercise facility and business center; cash bar and menu selections and A/V equipment.<br />(d). Location: Walking distance to a variety of restaurants, entertainment and shopping areas, commuting ease from major Airport, safety of hotel neighborhood, and located in either Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania or in Chicago, Illinois in the River North (Navy Pier), the Loop, or the Magnificent Mile area.</p>
<p><strong>2. Past Performance:</strong> <br />The contractor shall provide a list of three recent contracts that exemplify accomplished activities related to or similar to the activities identified in the SOW. The contact information for each reference shall include:<br />- Contract Value<br />- Agency/Company Name<br />- Type of Services Provided<br />- List of any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor's corrective action.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Price:</strong> <br />This price shall be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. <strong>Pricing shall be provided for the following contract line items (CLIN):</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLIN 001</strong> Hotel Lodging for four nights for 180 in accordance with the Solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 002</strong> Meeting Space Rental to include one administrative office; one general session room for 180 people; twelve break-out rooms for approximately 16 people in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 003</strong> Food and Beverages - upgraded mid-morning beverage replenishment for five (5) days; upgraded afternoon refreshments for four (4) days; and an Awards Reception with upgraded Hor d'oeurves and a cash bar for 180 people Monday night all in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 004</strong> Audio Visual/Flipchart services - including equipment and dedicated technical support in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 005</strong> Miscellaneous Expenses - Parking for 40 cars in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.&nbsp; The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.&nbsp;In case of a receipt of a large number of proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award.</p>
<p>First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition.<br /><strong>a.</strong> If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br /><strong>b.</strong> If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.<br /><strong>c.</strong> After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.</p>
<p>The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE SUBMISSION:<br /></strong>Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow the Price Proposal format and address the Technical requirements or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>If a hotel contract is necessary, it shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams, and square footage and menus. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Offeror shall submit a separate technical and price proposal that address the requirements of this solicitation.</strong></p>
<p>Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m. EDT on April 23, 2010 via email to Douglas Wolf at doug.wolf@nlrb.gov or by regular mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word. Proposals may be shipped or mailed to the following address:</p>

However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<BR>made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<BR>personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<BR>cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<BR>cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<BR>by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<BR>that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated.

Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<BR>tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<BR>determination.

Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute or claim concerning this contract which is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting Officer, who shall state his decision in writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy of it to the Contractor.

The Contractor shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of any appeal under this<br />clause. Pending final decision on such a dispute, however, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the contract and in accordance with the decision of the Contracting Officer unless directed to do otherwise by the Contracting Officer.<br />b. A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

<p>3. LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) - In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>

<p>7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)<br />a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee. <br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension; <br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2)below);or<br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires,<br />(4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and <br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof.

Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.</p>

<p>17. TAXES (JAN 2005)<br />a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) - (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a.

If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.</p>
<p>20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) - Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents-off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.</p>
<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)<br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):<br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered.

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.<br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other<br />cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No.DTRT57-10-Q-80066 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 and Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39 dated March 19, 2010. The NAICS Code is 541519 and the Small Business size standard is $25 M. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Contract on a competitive basis to provide commercial aircraft analysis tool and database software. For award rational see Evaluation Criteria below. Proposals shall include technical information and pricing for the following items in a written proposal. Note: Offerors are required to provide a price for all CLINS. CLIN 0001 Commercial Aircraft Analysis Tool and database per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN 0002 one year data license for up to 10 users for Commercial Aircraft Tool per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN 0003 One year software updates for Commercial Aircraft analysis Tool per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN 0004 One year technical support for Commercial aircraft Analysis Tool per Statement of Work 1 EA $______; CLIN0001-0004 Total for all CLINS in the requirement $________ .<br /><br />This Statement of Work (SOW) is as follows: BACKGROUND: Existing analytical tools are inadequate to assess interdependences between aviation-related noise and emissions including the cost/benefit analyses of proposed actions. Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Environment and Energy (FAA/AEE) is developing a robust, new, comprehensive framework of aviation environmental analysis tools and methodologies to perform these functions. This framework will be called the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT). The long-term aim of this new computer model is to provide a seamless, comprehensive set of tools to address all aspects of aircraft noise and emissions. FAA/AEE is undertaking the development of AEDT and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) will support this effort by leading the technical development of AEDT. A large part of this Volpe Center role will be the harmonization and integration of various types of commercial aircraft data, including aircraft engineering specifications, flight schedules, geographic information, and maintenance cost information. This type of commercial aircraft analysis will require an advanced aircraft performance analysis software tool that allows the user to access the information described below for existing turbo-prop and jet aircraft as well as theoretical aircraft that can be developed in the software.<br /><br />SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS: The software to be purchased will be used in preliminary design, existing aircraft evaluation, performance studies and other developmental tasks. The software must have a reasonably clean user interface that allows users to load existing aircraft from its database or define completely new ones from scratch. The aircraft will be evaluated, modified, and saved to a desktop or laptop computer equipped with the Microsoft Windows Operating System. The software must produce detailed reports and plots of the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics, departure, en-route, and approach performance, plus additional specifications described below. Text and pictures must be saved to standard formats, including Excel and PDF. The software must allow users to alter the aircraft design systematically to create parametric studies and tables, run iterations to match mission targets, or conduct multi-variable numerical optimizations that satisfy a variety of performance goals and constraints. <br />Detailed specifications for the commercial aircraft analysis software to be purchase are described below:<br /><br />1. Commercial Aircraft Design Input Parameters (see Attachment A for listing of required input parameters)
<p>&nbsp;2. Geometry and Balance Data (see Attachment B for specifications)</p>
<p>3. Mass Estimation Capability (see Attachment C for specifications)</p>
<p>4. Aerodynamic Characteristics Data (see Attachment D for specifications)</p>
<p>5. Aircraft Engine Modeling Capability (e.g.: dimensions of engine, fuel consumption)</p>
<p>6. Range and Mission Design and Performance Capability (see Attachment E for specifications)</p>
<p>7. Takeoff and Landing Field Length Design Capability (see Attachment F for specifications and example)</p>
<p>8. Parametric Studies and Numerical Optimization Capability</p>
<p>9. Flight Maneuver and Sequence Design Capability</p>
<p>10. Environmental Emissions (e.g.: noise, engine exhaust) and Cost Estimation, including Direct Operating Cost for dynamic scenarios</p>
<p>11. A one-year data license with technical support and software version updates is required</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64.<br />(2) While not required, the contractor may include in its subcontracts for commercial items a minimal number of additional clauses necessary to satisfy its contractual obligations.<br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

<DESC>I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45ED0 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal (RFP) incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. This is total small business set-aside procurement. The Small Business size standard is 1,000 employees. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: Solicitation/Contract number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and Solicitation Closing Date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half Street, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593. Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<p>There have been some clarification questions asked about a couple sections of the purchase description. Listed below are the questions and the responses given by the engineer.</p>
<p>Question: In line 2.11 Resolution, I think there is a typo. I think the spec should be stated as "No worse than 0.1 &micro;W..." for micro Watts rather than nW for nano Watts. Please verify that the spec should be micro Watts.</p>
<p>Response: In line 2.11 Resolution should be micro Watts.</p>
<p><br />Question: In section 4.9 there is a request for a 48" cable with "Tinned Ends" for "Misc Connector". Please verify that the item is required.</p>
<p>Response: We are looking for a calibration cable. Either Cable will do, RF Power Meter to labeled 7mm spade lugs, 48", for calibration support, or 48" Cable with 1 RF Power meter Interface and Tinned Ends for Misc Connector.</p>

The contractor shall schedule sweeping of traffic surfaces to minimize disruption to normal Ambulatory Care Center operations.  The contractor shall schedule sweeping of the parking areas and other areas as necessary to enable maximum cleaning of traffic surfaces minimally obstructed by parking vehicles, normal traffic, etc.                                                                                             2.	LAWN AND PLANT TREATMENT:  All grass areas shall be cut and maintained so that grass length does not exceed three and one-half (3.5) inches above the ground.  Grass shall not be cut any lower than two and one-half (2.5) inches above the ground.  VAACC-Columbus reserves the right to request additional mowing services on an as needed basis.  After cutting, clippings shall be mulched or removed to the extent that no clippings shall be visible.  (NOTE:  The grass areas all have a sprinkler system installed)  It is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor the height of grass and to mow when necessary.  The contractor shall also fertilize the lawn areas as needed to prevent the growth or spread of weeds, such as clover, dandelion, crabgrass, and other invasive weeds.  Fertilizer shall be put on the lawn to ensure that the lawn retains a lush, green appearance without bare spots.  The contractor shall also ensure that grubs are not present and treat as necessary to prevent further infestation including pest and insects control.  The contractor shall remove all dead trees and shrubs and provide the VAACC-Columbus a quotation for the cost of the replacement trees or shrubs.  Weeds/grass growing up from concrete or asphalt cracks/borders/expansion joints will be eradicated by the contractor, so as to maintain a weed free appearance.3.	AERATION OF SOIL:  Aeration consists of making plugs 5/8 inch in diameter by 3 inches deep on 9 inch centers across the complete area.  Aerating plugs shall be mulched or removed.  Aeration on those areas identified on the site plan exhibit shall be accomplished once each year during November. 4.	PLANTING, BEDS, MULCHING AND WEEDING:  All trees, shrubs, bushes and grasses shall be trimmed and pruned annually, and as deemed necessary by the VAACC-Columbus.  Where these plants are immediately adjacent to each other, trimming shall be performed at such a frequency and extent that no branches from one plant shall be within the extent of a branch from another plant.  Once perennial plants have bloomed and subsequently died, any remaining leaves or stems shall be trimmed back in a way that allows the plant to return the following year.  All mulch beds shall be replenished so as to maintain a minimum of 3 inches of mulch at all locations.  All beds shall be weeded at least at every mowing but will also be necessary when required by VAACC-Columbus.  The contractor shall be responsible for weeding all beds, so as to maintain a weed free appearance.5.	CLEAN-UP:  Grass cuttings, weeds and other debris on sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and other surfaces resulting from mowing, trimming, edging, and weeding will be swept, removed from serviced areas, and disposed of by the contractor at the contractors expense.  During the autumn months, leaves that accumulate on gutters, roadways, parking areas, sidewalks and grassy areas will be gathered, removed from the serviced areas, and disposed of by the contractor at the contractors expense.  Once during the spring and once during the fall, it is required that the contractor will perform an extensive cleaning including litter pickup of the areas mentioned, including using a commercial grade street sweeper.6.	NEW GRASS SEEDING:  Include in the quotation, the cost of all necessary labor, equipment, tools, materials, parts, supervision and incidental costs, including transportation and lodging to provide complete initial grass seeding of the newly acquired space (approximately 36,000 square feet) just south of the facility.  Anticipate that the ground will be rough graded.7.	SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:  In the performance of this contract, the contractor shall take all necessary and prudent safety precautions in order to protect the lives and health of all individuals that frequent the facility.  The Contracting Officer or his/her designee will notify the contractor of any non-compliance with the foregoing provisions and the action to be taken.  The contractor shall, after receipt of such notice, immediately correct the conditions to which attention has been directed.  Such notice, when served on the contractor, or his/her representative at the site of the work, shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose aforesaid.  If the contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or any part of the work and hold the contractor in default.8.	PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE:  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary to protect personnel, furnishings, equipment and buildings from damage; shall remove and replace movable items, if necessary, and shall replace or repair any item damaged due to work performed under this contract equal to its original construction and finish. 9.	SITE VISIT:  The contractor is urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.  A site visit will be scheduled by the Contracting Officer.  In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.10.	FACILITY MEASUREMENTS:  VAACC-Columbus currently consists of approximately 270,000 sq ft of grass that requires mowing, and approximately 49,000 sq ft of mulched areas.NOTE:  Approximately by mid summer of 2010, the VAACC-Columbus will acquire an additional property to the south of the existing location.  The new space will contain approximately 36,000 square feet of grass with minimal landscaping.  Once active, this space shall be maintained in the same manner detailed in the SOW.Other Requirements:1.	Competency of Contractor Personnel:  All services under this contract shall be performed by skilled personnel directly employed and supervised by the contractor.

Upon award, the contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer proof of insurance coverage.3.	Parking:  Contractor personnel shall park in areas as designated by Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).4.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

•	Detector:  HPGe; > 18% relative efficiency; 20 keV – 3.0 MeV energy range; FWHM < 1.0 keV @ 122 keV and < 2.0 keV @ 1332 keV; electric cooler; 256-8192 channel MCA with live-time correction, > 500 kc/s input count rate, 1-106 second Preset live or real time, high voltage inhibited until detector reaches operating temperature, two second spectrum update per 8k spectra, warning and alarm editable set-point alarm thresholds for dose rate/count rate/locator; and detailed detector and housing dimensions for MCNP modeling.
•	Fast, Simple and ULTRA-Reliable Classification of NORM, Medical, Industrial, SNM and Natural Isotopes, shielded and unshielded. 
•	Highly resistant to masking source interferences.
•	Illicit nuclear materials (SNM) Search Mode finds SNM sources in the presence of other sources.
SNM Search mode is designed to help avoid false negatives when determining SNM. It helps in finding the point of maximum count rate which COULD be consistent with SNM
•	Instantly ready to use at all times, straight from the docking station
•	Calibrate on any source: Check instrument calibration on any pre-specified source (e.g., 40K). 
•	PC remote control software: Remote control and display from your laptop, and spectra transfer
•	SEARCH:  Scanning mode for location of radioactive sources, with audio alert using an external ear piece with an adjustable alarm threshold. 
•	Scheme for Identification and classification of gamma-emitting radionuclidesGamma Dose Rate is monitored by the HPGE detector and by an internal compensated GM tube.
•	The dose rate is displayed at all times. Dose rate units may be chosen as µSv/hr or mR/hr.
•	GPS Position Information. An internal GPS receiver displays GPS coordinates which may be saved along with spectrum data for future use.
•	Storage of Data (spectrum, search data, ID results): To internal RAM and removable SD card.
•	Computer Interfacing: USB connection to laptop.
•	Detector should draw power from a variety of sources. Input Power 10 to 17 V DC 30 W or from battery or auto-sensing Mains powered Battery Charger. External Power DC In and battery Charge In. MS3112E12-10-s or Bendix PT02E-12-10S connector.

<DESC>The Wild Horse and Burro program is an integral part of the management of federal lands in the Eastern United States.  Every year wild horses that are determined to be excess on the public lands are removed and placed in the Adopt-A-Horse program.  This program places wild horses and burros into private homes around the country.  The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Piney Woods (PW) is charged with taking care of these animals on their journey to private adopted homes.  The primary feeding of alfalfa\grass hay is through the use of large round bales.  Alfalfa\grass hay ensures the care of wild horses on the facility. This will be the largest amount of hay needed to be supplied by the contractor.  Piney Woods also feeds animals in the smaller load pens and sick pens using small square bales.

<DESC>Question from vendor:Kitchen equipment was not noted but coordination with Veterans Canteen Service was noted. Does that mean the VA is handling the equipment and the A/E will just need to coordinate?  Were trying to determine if we need a kitchen equipment consultant on the team.Answer:The equipment will be supplied by the VCS but the A/E will need to coordinate their drawings/specs to relate to that equipment.

There will be no re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation. From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm. The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support; operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska. The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below. You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Period of Performance and (ii) Commercial Practices. Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired. Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted. The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force responsibilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska. Duties include (partial list) on-station management, airfield management, operations and maintenance, equipment and facilities repair and corrosion control, fire protection, power production, water treatment and distribution systems, heating systems, roads and grounds (incl. snow removal), fuels management, operations and maintenance of communications systems, weather support, and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.). The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early Spring 2010 with award in the Spring 2011 time frame, and with performance to begin on 1 October 2011. The current contract was solicited under 8(a) competition. Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement. Small businesses including veteran-owed, service disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women owned, as well as other small businesses are particularly invited to respond. The current contract was acquired under NAICS 561210, Facilities Support Services, and the corresponding size standard is $35.5M. The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether a Period of Performance of three years would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer; and if so, please explain why. The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions; however, the responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12. Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities for performing the above stated requirements and the required resources to satisfactorily perform the mission. Capability statements may be submitted to the contracting officer, Jani Faris, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506, and are requested by February 26, 2010.

<DESC><p dir="ltr">As part of a comprehensive lease business operations review, the General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS) has developed recommendations to streamline, simplify, and standardize the GSA leasing process to interact more efficiently with the private sector. Topics that directly affect private sector business interactions with GSA leasing are summarized in the attached documents and include:</p>
<p dir="ltr">reducing lease cycle time,</p>
<p dir="ltr">clarifying agency customer lease requirements,</p>
<p dir="ltr">reducing inconsistent practices across the regions,</p>
<p dir="ltr">developing lease models specific to succeeding and superseding lease actions (similar to industry renewal, extend and blend scenarios, etc), and</p>
<p dir="ltr">using simplified acquisition processes and an accelerated lease model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is important to know that the targeted steps will improve our interactions with those who lease to GSA, and those who want to lease to GSA. In particular, if these changes are implemented, will it be easier to lease to GSA, and will you be more likely to pursue government leases in the future?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Private industry feedback is a valuable tool in the GSA lease reengineering process; we will be posting a survey shortly in an effort to collect your responses to these proposed improvements to GSA leasing. In the meantime, we invite your comments and suggestions, which can be submitted to <a href="mailto:RefineLeasing@gsa.gov"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RefineLeasing@gsa.gov</span></a>.</p>

<DESC>Tomah, Wisconsin VAMCThis procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tomah, Wisconsin.  This project consists of approximately 2.85 acres of land at the VA Great Lakes Health Care System Tomah Campus, which is located in Tomah, WI.  VAs objective for this RFP is to receive proposals from Offerors to redevelop the available 2.85 (approximate) acres at the EUL Site under a long-term ground lease agreement with VA for up to seventy-five (75) years.  In return for a long-term lease of the property, the Offeror will provide fair consideration to VA. VAs primary objective in leasing the property is for a selected developer to establish and, thereby, increase the number of affordable housing units with on-site supportive services available to Veterans, including those at imminent risk of homelessness, and eligible non-Veterans. Additional information regarding this opportunity, including the RFP will be available on the project website:  http://www4.va.gov/assetmanagement/missionhomeless/tomah/index.asp

This project will remove equipment from buildings that are to be decontaminated as well as from buildings that are not to be decontaminated. Unwanted equipment in certain buildings will be left in place to be decontaminated with the buildings.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force (AF) Family Advocacy Program (FAP) is a medical program that enhances AF readiness by promoting family and community health and resilience. AF FAP also advocates for nonviolent communities. These objectives are accomplished through the use of broad-based education and awareness activities along with the identification and treatment of family maltreatment incidents. These services prevent family maltreatment from reducing the duty performance of AF members.
<p>The purpose of this effort is to acquire personal healthcare services in accordance with (FAR 37.104 &amp; DFARS 237.104) to provide qualified clinical (masters-level) social workers, U.S. licensed registered nurses, and family advocacy program staff personnel in implementing the Family Advocacy Program (FAP) at U.S. AF Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) based Outside Continental US Region (OCONUS) USAF Europe (USAFE).</p>
<p>Services performed under this contract shall be in accordance with (IAW) the established principles, practices, and ethics of the professional clinical therapies, Council on Social Work, American Nurses Association Standards of Nursing Practice, and Standards for Professional Nursing Practice in the care of women and newborns, and the Dept of the AF directives.</p>
<p>Qualified care shall be provided to outpatients and their families who are eligible beneficiaries of the military health care system. Contract personnel shall utilize the therapeutic modalities of individual, family, and group therapy to address the problems of family violence (specifically, child and partner maltreatment). They shall provide prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary) programs and support services for military families. The registered nurses shall provide community health nursing, family-focused prevention and clinical nursing services in the home or other environment to military families at risk for family violence.</p>
