NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS. LOCKHEED MARTIN IS THE DESIGN AGENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATOR AND THE NAVSEA APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND CERTIFIED DEPOT FOR THE AN/UYQ-70(V) WEAPON SYSTEM.

Building service transformers A and C will be replaced with new Government-furnished 3000 kVA transformers and existing building service transformers B and D will be re-used. A new above ground 30,000 gallon fuel storage tank and pumping system will be located adjacent to the generators to provide fuel for the new diesel generators. <br /><br />The RFP is estimated to be issued on or about 16 June 2017. The RFP will be issued on the Government Point of Entry known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). All plans and technical documents will be uploaded onto FedBizOpps as part of the RFP, available for inspection without charge. The estimated due date for proposals will be on or about 18 July 2017. Once issued, the RFP will identify a firm due date/time for receipt of proposals. The instructions for a site visit will be provided within the solicitation.<br /><br />The Government estimates issuing the contract award on or about 06 SEP 2017. The period of performance for construction is estimated to be 570 calendar days from the notice to proceed. In accordance with the DFAR 236.204, the magnitude disclosure of this construction project is over $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. This proposed contract action will be conducted using North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS): 236210 titled Electrical and Other Wiring Contractors. The size standard is $15M.<br /><br />BE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE PRE-SOLICITATION, SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>

<p><strong>1.	Solicitation Number:	 HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SBSS-17-385</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.	Title:  Bruker LF90 Body Composition Rat/Mice Analyzer</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.	Classification Code:  66 - Instruments &amp; Laboratory Equipment </strong></p>
<p><strong>4.	NAICS Code:  334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing </strong></p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong><br />Acquisition of this machine will allow for the measurement of body composition parameters in mice and rats by all NIA researchers including in the SLAM study. The hardware and software will be available to all labs within NIA. Currently the following laboratories use our machine (Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, Laboratory of Neuroscience, Laboratory of Genetics, Laboratory of Clinical Investigation and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science), however the access is limited due to heavy and continuous use by TGB for the SLAM project. Other research labs are accommodated however, labs that use rats can currently not use the machine we have due to its permanent placement in a mouse procedure room. Obtaining an additional machine would be of significant benefit to the NIA in that it would allow other researchers to obtain this data, furthermore it would facilitate researchers who use rats of which they currently cannot use the machine or obtain data due to its permanent placement in a mouse procedure room. We are requesting to purchase an additional machine of the same brand/make/model that we have now in order to collect more data, open its use to all of NIA, and to ensure that data we will collect will be comparable across machines/users/labs, thus we are requesting to purchase this particular machine.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong><br />The purpose of the research program of the Translational Gerontology Branch (TGB), NIA is to understand the basic biology of aging across species and to develop interventions that can improve health span and lifespan and be translated to humans. A staple of this kind of research is the ability to measure how body composition markers change with age and how these are related to changes that also occur in human aging. Understanding how important parameters change in mice and how they translate to humans is a staple of our research program. The objective for the purchase of this machine will be to greatly increase the throughput of TGB to perform these measures in the Study of Longitudinal Aging in Mice (SLAM), furthermore it will provide increased ability for other NIA researchers to utilize this machine. Currently other researchers have no or limited ability to obtain this data due to equipment constraints.</p>

No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> <br />This upgrade offers several new capabilities not found in the current instrument. This instrument allows for invivo scanning of mice and also increase the capability from four to eight channels to take advantage of the eight parallel array channels in the new coil. This upgrade will facilitate the safe and effective usage of the scanner by postdoc and postbac fellows lacking an extensive background in operating MRI scanners.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong><br />The proposed upgrade will accelerate the acquisition of MR images of the whole mouse body, liver and abdomen by simultaneously sampling data from multiple coils with different views ("parallel imaging"). The office currently performs these studies using a single-channel volume coil, so the use of eight parallel channels is expected to shorten scan time considerably, reducing the duration of anesthesia for each mouse and improving throughput. Moreover, parallel acquisition of body images can also be used to improve spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ration without excessive scan times. Finally, this accelerated sampling facilitates dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) studies, in which images must be acquired rapidly as an injected contrast agent distributes through the body. MRI studies of fat content and distribution in the whole mouse body (visceral vs. subcutaneous fat) and liver (hepatic steatosis) are a mainstay of our collaborative research efforts. Specific studies include the SLAM project (TGB), intermittent fasting in Parkinson's disease model mice (LNS) and CB1 receptor knockout and overexpression in a mouse model of lipoatrophy (LCI). Purchase of the 8-channel mouse body array coil and it's required console hardware will directly benefit these and all other studies involving abdominal imaging and body composition measurements.</p>

<DESC>The project is located at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB), Washington DC. The existing electrical distribution system for Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling is a four-feeder system served from the 15KV Switchgear housed in Building 168. Four PEPCO feeders #15631, 15632, 15633, and 15634 serve the switchgear in Building 168 and are then redistributed throughout the base.

Adjacent to Building 168 is the Base electrical redistribution switchgear. Four Navy feeders are connected to this redistribution switchgear from the main switchgear in building 168. Each of the four PEPCO feeders serving the four Navy feeders #704, 705, 706A and 706B are distributed to the Base through separate switches in each of the switchgear section lineups.

The existing radial feeder system has certain deficiencies that must be corrected in order to ensure that Base operations continue without service interruptions.
 The electrical substations located throughout the Base are composed of a feeder selector switch or a line-up of load
interrupter switches and a transformer. A significant portion of the feeder selector and air switches are in poor working condition. Many of the internal connections are weather corroded and in some cases, the barrier boards are partially unusable.

The majority of the existing feeder selector switches are square singular devices approximately 7’ wide by 7’ deep.  The Replacement switches are to be SF-6 Gas Switches, varying in size.  Each Substation will have at least one 3-way SF-6 Gas Switch. The main goals of the project are to provide a loop feeder selective system, demolition of the old electrical equipment, installation of new switches, and replacement of the collapsed duct-bank.

Due to the necessity for continued operations on the Base, no substation can sustain an extended power outage.
  Therefore, generators and associated equipment must be provided to carry the load during any interruption of electrical power related to the project.
