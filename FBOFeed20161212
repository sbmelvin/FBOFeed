The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry of the Air Forces' intent to award a Sole Source contract directed towards BAE Systems Controls, Inc. (BAE), Cage Code 89954 pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c )(1) and 10 USC2304(d)(1)(i)(ii), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), BAE, is the only source with the data, parts, expertise, tools and test equipment necessary to repair sufficiently to meet the Government's needs.  BAE is the only responsible source that can satisfy the agency requirement and provide these unique skills to meet the KC135 system program office's requirement.
The effort is in support of the KC135 Weapons System.  The contemplated contract is for repair of Integrated Fuel Management Panel and Computer Fuel Manager by BAE.  The contractor shall be required to accomplish repairs, delivery and provide program support. 
The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Codes are as follows:

CONTRACT TYPE, PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE AND SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING 
 The current acquisition strategy is to issue a Firm Fixed Price contract with a basic year and two options under FAR 15.  The contemplated period of performance is May 2017 thru May 2022.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army PEO STRI is seeking capability information from industry for consideration during development of an acquisition strategy to obtain necessary personnel, material, equipment, facilities, and services to execute the One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Integration, interoperability and support (I2S) and Production activities as well as the Enterprise Data Services (EDS) software development and support activities.  OneSAF is the US Army's next generation Constructive, entity level Computer Generated Forces/Semi-Automated Forces (CGF/SAF).  Training providers and Warfighters greatly benefit from accurate authoritative data to represent the operational environment.  Multiple scenario data generation systems exist; however, it is difficult to find, obtain, and reuse data.  The Army requires new and agile processes to pull data from the numerous data sources available to facilitate the building of accurate data bases.  The Enterprise Data Services (EDS) is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to assist with the discovery, use and re-use of data across both the DoD and Modeling &Simulation (M&S)  communities with a goal to provide a M&S enterprise common data production environment that brokers access to distributed cross-community and cross-Service data discovery, retrieval, and enhancement capabilities through enterprise web service. <br>  <br> The current ONESAF operates in a Government leased space.  With the future effort, it is anticipated for EDS to formulate a larger portion of the requirements.  Along with the addition of EDS, it is desired to have the PEO Government workforce residing in non-leased space.  As such, the requirements below regarding contractor owned/leased and managed facilities are desirable in support of this RFI. <br>  <br> The following identifies the business areas for which the requirements apply:  <br>  <br>  	Modeling, architecting, and engineering activities supporting development and <br> maintenance. <br>  <br>  	Develop and support enterprise data services to support data discovery, retrieval, and enhancement services. <br>  <br>  	Incrementally build a service-oriented DoD data enterprise that will enable the rapid discovery, retrieval, and reuse of data and services across the spectrum of M&S communities. <br>  <br>  	Develop of data enhancement services data tools for enterprise data services. <br>  <br>  	Integration, interoperability, and support services as well as system testing activities in house and on site. <br>  <br>  	Development and support for cloud enabled approach to enable the discovery, use, and re-use of data for OneSAF and M&S Communities (Planning, Analysis, Acquisition, Training, Intelligence, Experimentation, and Test and Evaluation). <br>  <br>  	Training OneSAF products and providing supplemental training aids to support training needs to OneSAF user community. <br>  <br>  	Distribution and support of products and tools to 200+ DOD, Joint service, and international sites and users worldwide. <br>  <br>  	Help Desk support activities to include telephonic support, e-mail support, and exercise support. <br>  <br>  	Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) updates and distribution to development environment and supported sites.  <br>  <br>  	Facility to conduct development, integration, and testing. <br>  <br>  	GFE, GFP, and equipment management at a contractor owned and managed location. <br>  <br>  	Facility must be capable of supporting development and storage of both unclassified and classified material. <br>  <br>  	Facility to support the handling, storage, and development of software in a connected Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on both unclassified and classified networks. <br>  <br>  <br> Services and Products to include: <br>  <br> (1)		Object Oriented Software Development. <br>  <br> (2)		Conceptual Modeling, Software Architecture, and Systems Engineering. <br>  <br> (3)		Integration, interoperability, test, and support. <br>  <br> (4)		Information technology (IT) duties and IDE and secure lab management and sustainment. <br>  <br> (5)		Configuration Management of distributed OneSAF software. <br>  <br> (6)		Developer and user training activities as well as fielding support. <br>  <br> (7)		Mission Command (MC) interface development and integration. <br>  <br> (8)		Synthetic Environment development and support. <br>  <br> (9)		IAVA Patch Management, consisting of consolidation and distribution to the field after successful testing. <br>  <br> (10)	Tele-training/teleconferencing. <br>  <br> (11)	Exercise technical support. <br>  <br> (12)	Exercise operational support (tying the software to the training objectives). <br>  <br> (13)	GFE, GFP, and equipment management at a contractor owned and managed location. <br>  <br> (14)	Processing, handling, and storage of classified and unclassified data. <br>  <br> (15)	Cloud/Web-based interface and portal development. <br>  <br> (16)	Development on both classified and unclassified networks. <br>  <br> MARKET RESEARCH APPROACH:  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates an award in 1QFY17.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Enhanced Pharmacodynamics LLC., 701 Elliott Street, Buffalo, New York 14203-1101 to procure the following:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. To develop a population PK model to describe the plasma concentrations of ManNAc and its metabolite sialic acid (Neu5Ac) following single and repeated oral dose administration to GNE myopathy patients;<br />2. To perform Monte Carlo simulations using the population PK model to generate patient-specific plasma ManNAc and Neu5Ac concentration-time profiles for various ManNAc doses with the goal of finding the lowest possible dose of ManNAc which can produces sustained increases in Neu5Ac.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The NHGRI/Medical Genetics Branch (MGB) seeks to identify and understand inherited disorders of metabolism and of human development. MGB investigators focus on human genetics, vertebrate embryology, inborn errors of metabolism, and neurogenetic disorders. Projects performed at the biochemical, molecular, and cell biological levels involve the direct study of human subjects as well as the development and use of experimental model systems, such as zebrafish and mouse. Studies of these rare patients and populations have proven invaluable for advancing the mission of the Branch.</p>
<p>NHGRI/Medical Genetics Branch (MGB) are currently performing a Phase 2 clinical trial with the drug ManNAc, a precursor of sialic acid, as a therapeutic agent for patients with GNE myopathy. NHGRI Investigators collected extensive pharmacokinetic (PK = how each patient processed ManNAc and created its product sialic acid) and patient physiologic data (gender, age, weight, body surface, etc). With these data and pathway knowledge, scientists at Enhanced Pharmacodynamics (ePD) can perform so-called "Population Pharmacokinetics" by using unique computer programs to perform modeling to determine optimal concentration of drug and frequency of dosing, to inform for our Phase 3 clinical trial that is under design. ePD can also model different study designs and perform clinical trial simulations to inform about the most optimal trial design.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br /></span>The purpose of this procurement is the development of a population pharmacokinetic model for ManNAc in patients with GNE Myopathy. NHGRI/Medical Genetics Branch (MGB) expect Phase 3 trial, currently in planning stages, to lead to FDA approval of the drug ManNAc as a therapeutic for GNE myopathy patients. Therefore, an expert rationale for NHGRI chosen drug dosing schedule (timing and concentration) is needed (FDA requirement for drug approval). Enhanced Pharmacodynamics (ePD) offers a very comprehensive statistical way of analyzing at all the data and modeling it in a way that can be related to design of a next trial and is also experienced with (FDA) reporting formats for these data. Enhanced Pharmacodynamics (ePD) is highly revered in the clinical trial modeling field and previous expertise and knowledge with NHGRI Clinical Trial. Scientists at Enhance Pharmacodynamics, LLC (ePD) have over 15 years of experience in this field of work and worked with pharmaceutical industry, government and FDA to perform this work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work</span>:</p>
<p>A population PK model for ManNAc and sialic acid will be developed using the data from approximately 34 patients with GNE myopathy from Phases 1 and 2 of clinical development. The non-linear mixed effects modeling software NONMEM Version 7.3 will be used to develop the population PK model. The first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) will likely be utilized. Following identification of an appropriate structural population PK model, a formal covariate analysis will be performed to determine if any patient demographic (age, weight, height, body mass index, body surface area or sex), clinical laboratory measures (serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance), genetic factors, or other disease-related indices can explain a portion of the inter-individual variability in PK parameters for ManNAc or sialic acid. Selected population PK models during model development along with the final population PK model will be evaluated for robustness using standard population model evaluation criteria (e.g., goodness-of-fit diagnostics, examination of individual predicted overlays, visual predictive checks, analysis of normalized prediction distribution errors, derivation of non-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals for each parameter, etc.).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables / Reporting Requirements</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Slide Presentations summarizing the results of the population PK Analysis and simulations to support dose justification as the final deliverable.<br />&bull; Final data transfer will be organized by NIH/NHGRI as ASCII, Microsoft Excel&reg;, or SAS&reg; transport files. ePD will work closely with the Government as the PK analysis dataset is built and finalized.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Rights:</span></p>
<p>&bull; FAR Clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data - General (May 2014)<br />&bull; FAR Clause 52.227-17, Rights in Data--Special Works (December 2007).</p>

<p>The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) requires Contractor support in one or more areas of scientific investigation.  Both recently enacted and pending management actions by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council have resulted in considerable reductions in availability of fishery dependent data for many fish species in the snapper-grouper complex, resulting in an increased need for Fishery Independent (FI) data.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to collect fishery independent data on reef fish resources in in Southeast U. S. waters.  Contract cruise operations in 2017-2021 shall require 30 days at-sea each year.  Contingent upon funding, additional days at-sea may be required each year.  The Contractor shall provide the following at-sea tasks during Charter Vessel Services during multiple multi-day cruises.  The vessel shall be ported out of Savannah, GA:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conduct stationary camera surveys of reef fish resources;<br />&bull;	Collect reef fish using chevron fish traps, with ice/cold storage available;<br />&bull;	Conduct total water column CTD profiles;<br />&bull;	Process and store fish samples for transport to on-shore laboratories (wet lab operations, with frozen storage available);  <br />&bull;	At-sea sensor data collection and manual data entry (dry lab operations, supported by a marine/survey technician);<br />&bull;	Deploy and retrieve independent project sampling gears as needed (e.g., longline gear, autonomous underwater vehicles, portable sonars, acoustic receiver hydrophones); and<br />&bull;	At-sea operations shall involve visiting up to 30 discrete sites per day, requiring vessel idling for gear deployment (traps, cameras, and CTD) and retrieval during daylight hours and potentially at night.  Stations depths are expected to range from ~ 15-120 m.  Ship personnel/crew shall be required to assist with gear deployment and retrieval using a hydraulic pot hauler.  Scientific personnel will operate up to 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>&bull;	The Vessel requirements include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>o	Vessel length must not be less than 90 feet; <br />o	Maximum cruising speed must not be less than nine (9) knots;<br />o	Must accommodate up to 12 scientific personnel not including crew;  <br />o	Vessel must have 600 square feet of back deck space to accommodate traps, lines, buoys, coolers, and other sampling gear.</p>
<p>This RFQ is issued Unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  The small business size standard is 1000 employees.  The solicitation and proposed firm-fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items. The Award will be made to the quoter whose quote meets all Statement of Work (SOW) and solicitation requirements and is judged to be the best value, by an integrated assessment of price and other evaluation factors listed in the Request for Quote (RFQ). <br /><br />The anticipated award date is March 2017.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This sources sought does not constitute an invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, nor Request for Quotations and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.
<p>Background: The majority of the heat transfer measurements made in the AEDC Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9 facility have been collected using coaxial thermocouples mounted directly into a stainless steel substrate (15-5PH or 17-4PH stainless steel) test article. Typical wall thickness of the steel substrate generally ranges between 0.5"-0.25" and interior volume to route lead wires can be limited. These installation limitations require the sensor length to be similar to the wall thickness and the transition from the sensor shell to the lead wires must occur close to the base of the sensor. Finally, a thin layer of temperature sensitive paint is often applied directly on the wind tunnel model after the coaxial thermocouples have been installed and contoured to the test article.</p>
<p>Type-E, Chromel-Constantan, coaxial thermocouples have been successfully utilized for over 30 years in the unique and stressing Tunnel 9 hypervelocity test environment due to their high durability, fast-response times and their ability to be contoured to the outer mold lines of the test article. Surface temperature response is acquired during the test run using a coaxial thermocouple and the heat transfer is derived using the coaxial thermocouple temperature data as boundary condition to a finite-differencing solution of the transient heat conduction equation for a finite thickness wall.</p>
<p>Sensor installation and data utilization techniques have been optimized at Tunnel 9 to provide highly accurate temperature/heat transfer measurements in Tunnel 9. A significant amount of resources have been used to characterize their performance over the years with extensive testing and analytical modeling. As a facility, Tunnel 9 is always looking to improve the state-of-the-art in measurement technology; however, the validation for opportunities to evaluate different coaxial gages for making heat transfer measurements of a new technique is costly and time-consuming. As such, we continue to search the marketplace for potential alternate suppliers of coaxial thermocouples so that these new sensors can be experimentally evaluated in the Tunnel 9 environment before a large scale procurement and deployment into future test programs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify businesses having the capability to provide miniature, fast-response coaxial thermocouples for use in the Tunnel 9 Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel with the following salient characteristics/features:</p>
<p>1. NIST-traceable Type-E, Chromel-Constantan thermocouple materials (outer sheath Chromel and inner pin Constantan)<br />2. Outer sensor cylinder diameters of 0.061" or smaller<br />3. Sensor to be installed into test article using adhesives such as Loctite #271 or #620 <br />4. Sensor can be contoured to outer-mold-lines of test article after adhesive fully cured <br />5. Thermocouple junction at the outer surface of the model created by abrasion (file and/or sand paper).<br />6. Fast response time to metal wall surface temperature changes, typically on the order of microseconds<br />7. Transition from coaxial thermocouple body to lead wires to occur close to body, approximately 0.15 or less"<br />8. Any strain relief applied between the coaxial thermocouple body and lead wires cannot be larger than the cylindrical diameter of the coaxial thermocouple body<br />9. Lead wires from coaxial thermocouple assembly to be provided as either Type-E thermocouple wire or with copper wires welded to thermocouple wires approximately 4" from sensor base. Lead wires should be no larger than 30 AWG Teflon insulated solid wires.</p>
<p>In response to this notice, please address the following:<br />1) Has your product been utilized in a hypersonic wind tunnel testing environment or other similar application as described above? If so, what applications, facilities and/or organizations have they been utilized? <br />2) Respond to each of the characteristics/features as standard or non-standard.<br />3) Respond with the method provided to meet the non-standard characteristics/features.<br />4) Is your company an authorized distributer or the actual manufacture?<br />5) Can you provide a specification sheet of the product solution for characteristic/feature comparison?<br />6) What would be the estimated time to deliver 30, 60 or 90 sensors?<br />7) Provide a statement about product warranty.<br />8) Does your company have a GSA contract available for this product? If so, provide your GSA contract number.<br />9) If this is solicited in the future, provide a price estimate (+-10%) and shipping costs FOB Arnold AFB, TN 37389?<br />10) Provide:<br />a.

<p>PURPOSE/REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541611, which has a corresponding Size Standard of $15 Million.</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is twofold: 1.) To acquire logistics services to provide logistics analyses and reports to support Depot Level Reparable (DLRs) Spares and Air Force- (AF-) Managed Consumables; and 2.) To further develop, test, transition, and refine innovative, non-forecast-based, inventory stockage methodologies for highly variable and sporadic demand items, known as Peak Policy and Next Generation Inventory Model (Peak/NextGen), and to support Air Force implementation of such methodologies in current legacy systems as well as possible future advanced planning systems. This requirement supports all AF-managed items maintained at Hill Air Force Base (AFB), Utah, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma (OK), and Robins AFB, Georgia. In support of DLR Spares and AF-Managed Consumables required tasks may include: Analyzing, researching, reporting, information gathering, tracking, organizing, developing, coordinating, and reviewing data required in support of DLRs Spares and AF-managed consumables. Additionally, this effort involves estimating changes in backorders and the resulting issues and stockage effective measures that result from changes in AF operations or policies. Under Peak/Next Gen, the Air Force is pursuing the development and implementation of advanced inventory management methods that specifically address challenging demand patterns related to managing items with infrequent or highly variable demand, based on optimization and risk management techniques, not forecasting. The methods enable a three-way trade-off among customer wait time, inventory value, and procurement and repair workload, providing a more optimal solution to meet business objectives. These advanced methods are mathematically intensive and require a modeling and simulation capability to simulate performance using randomized and historical replay based on five or more years of demand history, as well as dynamic levels updates. The Air Force requires the services of subject matter experts to further develop, test, transition, and refine these innovative methodologies for highly variable and sporadic demand items to improve the Air Force's inventory performance.</p>
<p>Potential sources for this logistics services support MUST be able to produce a "mirror" process of D200A, i.e. replicate the output of D200, EXACTLY and PRECISELY. This includes an Aircraft Availability Modeling (AAM) technique that is highly specific and is not utilized elsewhere in the Government or commercial world.</p>
<p>Potential sources must have an intimate knowledge of Air Force forecasting and legacy systems. This particular requirement is utilized when budget and/or man-power adjustments are necessary. It is a required level of support that is non-negotiable. Potential sources MUST be able to demonstrate this level of support on day one of the performance period.</p>
<p>The potential sources would also be required to mirror D200N, Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) and Readiness Spares Packages (RSP).</p>
<p>Qualified contractors will need expert knowledge in mathematics with an emphasis in statistical analysis. Qualified contractors will need expert knowledge of Visual Basic.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors may be required to travel to Tinker Air Force Base for consultations and reviews at least once a year. Travel to other locations, as determined by the Government, may also be required.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors will not have access to Government servers.</p>
<p>Potential sources must have an approved accounting system.</p>
<p>Potential sources shall be required to work with the supply support staff office at Tinker AFB via the Contracting Officer's Representative, to service the Supply Chain Management Group (SCMG) across three centers (Tinker AFB, Robins AFB, and Ogden AFB). Potential sources shall be required to generate recurring and nonrecurring reports, utilizing Microsoft Office. The recurring analyses and reports include quarterly and bi-annual taskings. These taskings include quantity shifts sent to bases and depots for use and repair, weapon system variance comparison based on programmatic data pulled from a contractor-owned website and forecasting accuracy analysis comparing the biannual budget cycle to the previous year's budget cycle. Contact information for potential sources-owned website will be provided in the event of a contract award.</p>
<p>Potential sources must be able to run, execute, modify, and analyze Peak/NextGen for Air Force reparable items. Peak/NextGen are computational methodologies that were developed by Logistics Management Institute (LMI), and the algorithms and associated computer code are LMI intellectual property and business proprietary information. Peak/NextGen are in use by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for consumable items, and an initial analysis of Peak/NextGen for Air Force reparable items was funded by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration, DASD(SCI), from the Spring of 2014 to the Spring of 2016. DASD(SCI) funding of Peak/NextGen for Air Force-managed reparable items has ceased, and the Air Force plans to continue Peak/NextGen analysis efforts. The Air Force requires the services of subject matter experts to further analyze, test, and refine Peak/NextGen methodologies for highly variable and sporadic demand items to improve the Air Force's inventory performance. The ability to run, execute, modify, and analyze Peak/NextGen is a required level of support that is non-negotiable. The Air Force does not have access to Peak/NextGen algorithms and computer code, and potential sources must provide these methodologies on day one of the performance period. The Air Force will provide demand and basic item management data to potential sources, but all Peak/ NextGen algorithms, code, and supporting software must be provided by the contractor. This requirement is not for the development of information technology capability.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is three years, comprised of a 1-year basic period and two 1-year option periods.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding this requirement, potential sources should review the attached PWS.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:</p>

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. A cost comparison will be performed in relation to the expenses incurred at the current location.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSAL AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.
 The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential qualified 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) and Small Business firms for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Geotechnical Engineering Services.
    Architect-Engineer or Engineering Services will be required primarily for Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia, but shall include other various activities within the Geographic area of responsibility of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic, including the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Africa and Europe.  One Indefinite Quantity Contract will be awarded as a result of this competition.  Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION BUT SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.
After review of the responses submitted, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.
The type of geotechnical engineering services expected to be performed are:
1.	Conduct subsurface investigations and site characterization studies with subsequent geotechnical/foundation analysis- including monitoring, sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for geotechnical properties using various field and laboratory tests and construction or materials testing and engineering inspection services.
 Analysis may also require specialized geotechnical software.  Geophysical services (i.e. GPR, EM, ReMi, SASW, MASW).  

2.	Field investigation typically will require mobilization to locations using transportation not provided by the U. S. Government, arranging for required security clearance to obtain base access for all drillers and equipment, field location of utilities with appropriate equipment, and locating and performing borings and providing GPS (Lat/Long) coordinates for all boring locations and landmarks  accurate to 1 meters or better.  Mobilization should include personnel for boring layout, scoping for utilities and coordination with the local point(s) of contact  including necessary clearances and permission for access.
  Mobilization will also require 24 hour groundwater data in a minimum of 20% of the borings or three representative locations, whichever is greater.  If the drilling method does not allow direct reading from the borehole, a temporary well must be installed. Incidental monitoring requiring sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for environmental contamination shall include, but not be limited to, providing capability to monitor boreholes for combustible gas or petroleum vapors at sites of potentially contaminated soil material and/or groundwater, and providing labor, equipment and protection measures (EPA Levels C and D) for performing subsurface investigations.


3.	Services shall also include providing soils and environmental personnel (technical and professional) at field and laboratory locations to perform or evaluate the subsurface investigation, testing or inspection for subsequent construction or design.
  

4.	Per Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-300-09N, a typical report will include a description of the drilling method used and any pertinent site observations along with the boring location plan, the boring logs and tabulated laboratory test results with typical graphical backup.  Report shall also include research and evaluation of historical geotechnical data, topographic data, and aerial photographs.  When required, services may include a more extensive written report containing a discussion of sampling procedures, site conditions influencing investigation/testing/project design and/or project recommendations based upon interpretation of test results and the results of investigation/testing performed.
  

Seconday tasks may be required infrequently, and may include, but not be limited to:

1.	Provide engineering services involving consultation, inspection and/or evaluation of materials or site conditions during the design, during construction, or after construction (including but not limited to slope stability analysis, earthwork-related site improvements, foundations, concrete and bituminous pavements).    

2.	Provide the following services/products: preparation of technical reports, studies, engineering investigations, wetland delineation and mapping, cost estimates, surveys (property, topographic, hydrographic, wetland etc.), shop drawing reviews, construction related consultation and inspection and field and laboratory testing for environmental contamination.
 
 
3.	Provide inspection of airfield (and other) pavements and prepare Pavement Condition Index (PCI) Reports using the most current version of MicroPAVER pavement management software. Work may include the generation and maintenance of GIS section location maps  accurate to within 8 inches or better.  

4.	Conduct forensic investigations of existing pavements and/or vertical structures to document existing conditions as well as determine, where possible, the cause of any distresses or constructions defects. Forensic investigations will also be used to identify materials that do not match the characteristics of the ones specified as well as identify material attributes or indicators that would suggest that the materials utilized will exhibit poor durability or be susceptible to early deterioration and failure.
 

5.	Conduct sampling, testing, and reporting of hazardous material such as lead, asbestos, PCBs, and mercury.  Reporting shall include remediation recommendations, Environmental drawings that can be used as part of demo and construction design package, and specifications for demolition and construction. 

6.	Provide design drawings and specifications for work involving geotechnical, civil storm water, drainage systems, pavement systems, hazardous materials, and elements associated with civil, foundation, and site demolition.

<p><em><strong>Synopsis of Requirement</strong></em></p>
<p>The Arthur J.

The project also consists of Hazmat abatement. The primary shafts (the stairs, elevators and other building systems risers) will be re-configured to suit modern requirements and a revised layout.  The modernized building will incorporate sustainable design principles, efficient space planning, innovative technologies, and contemporary interior design to transform the building into a model workplace that is responsive to the existing building architecture.  The mechanical plant in the basement will remain operational throughout construction.  The project will also consist of modernization of the auditorium connected to the Altmeyer Building.</p>
<p>The Robert M. Ball building swing space renovation will consist of renovating approximately 70,000 square feet of existing office space. Project scope will consist of MEP and interior renovations, with construction of private and open office space.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cost Accounting Standards</em></strong></p>

<p>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) currently employs the AN/PAS-22 Long Range Thermal Imager (LRTI), which is a cooled Indium Antimonide (InSb) MWIR bi-ocular with a 24 micron pixel pitch and 320x256 Focal Plane Array (FPA), which was fielded over ten years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to advancements in technology, significant reductions in size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) are expected for the replacement of this system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The AN/PVS-27 Scout Sniper Mid-Range Night Sight (SSMRNS) is the only night weapon optic currently available to the scout sniper community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an Image Intensification (I2) device, whose performance and range is limited by available light at night, as well as battlefield obscurants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed sensor would greatly enhance the capabilities of Marine Snipers at night.</p>
<p>PdM ONS plans to hold a demonstration in FY17 to show what is currently available with the above described or similar performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As no program exists for this technology yet, MARCORSYSCOM is looking to generate interest by demonstrating that this technology is feasible and worthy of investment to develop further.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PdM ONS priorities for the near-term demonstration are:</p>
<p>1) Broadband detector covering the bands of interest, both to verify spectral range (NIR to MWIR) and capture phenomenology of the targets (can detect personnel in the open and behind transparencies, laser spots) and background</p>
<p>2) Broadband optics with focal length and f-number representative of capability required to make personnel weapon/no-weapon determination at 1,500m.</p>
<p>White Paper responses should address what Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) can be expected for both *time and cost* to develop this technology further, specifically related to:</p>
<p>1) Fabrication of the FPA</p>
<p>2) Integration of a dewar-cooler assembly (IDCA)</p>
<p>3) Broadband window</p>
<p>4) Broadband lens</p>
<p>5) Power estimates for current hardware and path/goals for an optimized system including sensors, cooler, and electronics</p>
<p>6) Demonstration at a Quantico test range, including what support may be needed to perform a demonstration (such as a generator, liquid nitrogen, etc.)</p>
<p>7) Estimated costs for a single-unit, IDCA demonstrator camera and lens</p>
<p>8) Estimated production costs for optimized camera and lens in quantities of 1,000+.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The page limitation for the White paper is not to exceed 20 pages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Written responses can be in any format, but electronic media must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat formats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>RFI responses are due no later than <span style="COLOR: red">31 January 2017</span>, 3:00 p.m. Responses may also be mailed or e-mailed to the following addresses:</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA) under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements quote mark, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, this announcement constitutes the only solicitation; any offers will be considered; however, it is the Government's intent to award a sole-source purchase order to Mathworks.
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to award a sole source contract for services to the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Software Engineering Directorate (SED). The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Targets and Countermeasures (TC) Program, requires MATLAB Software as well as a collection of specific toolboxes to support the design, development, testing and analysis of upcoming missions within the Targets IV&amp;V laboratory. The selection of toolboxes and toolsets identified in this request directly match those being used by the mission's Prime in order to match exact revisions and behavior identified by the Prime. Licenses for the Control toolkit as well as the Power Systems are vital for the accurate reproduction of hardware behavior without having to maintain a physical target(s) within our facility. Our Prime has utilized Mathworks software, thus SED must replicate the configuration in order to adequately analyze and investigate data within our independent verification and validation (IV&amp;V) environment. SED has used and continues to use MATLAB within our lab, but the specific add-ons and tools identified within this request are specific to the mission, hardware, and Prime requirements. These tools exclusively tie back to software and support material developed, maintained and tested by the Prime and as such are the only options that the Targets IV&amp;V team can utilize. Without this license, our current MATLAB resources do not possess the required tool base to analyze Power Systems data, the control behavior and accomplish the desired verification and validation for the MDA Targets and Countermeasures Program Office. Failure to obtain these MATLAB software items will significantly impact the planned mission verification and validation effort for missions supporting MDA Targets Readiness.</p>
<p>Delivery date 15 JAN 17.<br />The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, labor, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and other items and services necessary to perform product related configuring services in support of configuration and data management processes for the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Software Engineering Directorate (SED), Redstone Arsenal, AL.</p>
<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition: <br />52.204-7, SAM<br />52.204-9, Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel<br />52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial.<br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.<br />52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items.<br />52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items.<br />52.222-26, Equal Opportunity<br />52.222-50, Combat Trafficking in Persons<br />52.223-18, Texting While Driving<br />52.232-1, Payments<br />52.239-1, Privacy or Security Safeguards<br />252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.<br />252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical capability and price. Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>All submissions and any questions regarding this request must be submitted via email to: Katrina.e.twigg.mil@mail.mil</p>

<DESC>Request for Information <br /><br />Title: Selection Assessments Measuring the Executive Core Qualifications<br /><br />Introduction: The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a need to develop assessments for selecting individuals into the Senior Executive Service. The Senior Executive Service includes most managerial, supervisory, and policy positions classified above General Schedule (GS) grade 15 or equivalent positions in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. OPM would like to learn what assessments, to be used for selection purposes, industry has available or can develop to measure the competencies falling under the Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). The ECQs are required for entry to the Senior Executive Service and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for management and executive positions. The ECQs were designed to assess executive experience and potential in relation to non-technical competencies. The ECQ competencies and their definitions are provided in the attachment. OPM has published guidelines for the Senior Executive Service qualifications found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/reference-materials/guidetosesquals_2012.pdf. The assessments OPM plans to develop for this effort are an expansion of the merit staffing selection methods described in this document.
<p>Questions:<br />1. What assessment solutions, measuring the competencies underlying the ECQs, can industry provide or develop to select individuals into the Senior Executive Service? Please be specific in describing the assessments, the approach to measuring the competencies, and evidence to support their validity.<br /><br />2. What unique approaches can industry provide in reporting the results of the assessments for use by decision-makers as well as for developmental purposes by applicants?<br /><br />3. OPM will need to administer these assessments across the United States as well as internationally. What method of administration can industry provide in delivering these assessments?<br /><br />4. What pricing options can industry provide to eliminate recurring costs for the Government associated with using the assessments? If recurring costs cannot be eliminated, how can they be minimized?</p>

<DESC>Notice Information<br />Solicitation: AT22276
<p>Title: Compuware software support maintenance services</p>
<p>Description(s):</p>
<p>This NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A NON COMPETITIVE CONTRACT is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules. The authority for this award is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) - Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>The Chief Information Officer (CIO), Operations Technology Management Data Center (DC) provides business services to the Retirement &amp; Benefits, Federal Investigative Services (FIS), Merit Systems Audit &amp; Compliance, e-HRI and other OPM Lines of Business. Compuware System software is used by these Lines of Business to manage their applications processing on the IBM Enterprise Servers.</p>
<p>Compuware software maintenance services entitle DC to new versions of various operating system software products, assistance with identifying and fixing problems 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and the changes necessary to repair any defects found. This service is critical to enable DC to provide timely resolutions of problems or defects which may be found in Retirement &amp; Benefits, FIS, and other OPM Lines of Business software applications.</p>
<p>OPM has a requirement for renewal of Compuware software maintenance services. OPM intends to issue a task order to Compuware Corporation, One Campus Martius &bull; Detroit, Michigan 48226 to renew software support maintenance services for the following:</p>
<p><br />Start Renewal Date:	January 1, 2017<br />End Renewal Date:	December 31, 2017</p>
<p>Product and Licensed Quantity</p>
<p>Abend-AID for CICS with COBOL 3492 MIPS <br />Abend-AID with Primary Language - COBOL 3042 MIPS <br />File-AID/Data Solutions 3042 MIPS <br />File-AID/MVS 3042 MIPS <br />File-AID/RDX 1521 MIPS <br />Hiperstation for VTAM 1521 MIPS <br />Xpediter/CICS with COBOL 1521 MIPS <br />Xpediter/TSO with COBOL  1521 MIPS <br />Xpediter/Xchange 1521 MIPS</p>
<p><br />Compuware Corporation is the only known supplier of this proprietary software and the only vendor capable of supporting their products. It is not the position of OPM that no other firm can perform the work. OPM deduced that no other offeror could immediately perform all of the services required without incurring substantial unacceptable delay. Any other contractor would cause OPM schedule risk to provide the required services.</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO SATISFY THE REQUIRMENTS OF FAR SUBPART 5.2. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via e-mail to Lucy B Tascone, lucy.tascone@opm.gov , within three (3) days of the published date of this notice. Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. All OPM contractors are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to execution of award. If no competitive responses are received, an award will be made to Compuware Corporation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541511.</p>

Due to the very nature of OFP development and test, OFP software is in a continuous state of flux. During the development phase, the 578th SMXS receives numerous incremental versions of the ADCP OFP from Boeing and must quickly load the compiled code onto the workbenches to enable local developers and testers of PACS-46 and AIU OFPs to integrate their work with the latest changes to the central computer. Currently, Boeing Aerospace uses the AdaCore GNAT Pro Ada compiler in their ADCP OFP development. A letter was received from AdaCore Technologies on 30 August 2016 stating that they are the sole source provider of GNAT Pro and GNAT Pro tools and support. AdaCore is also the sole source provider for any upgrade to the GNAT Pro subscription.</span></p>

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

Deliveries shall be made during normal business hours of 7:30am through 2:30pm CST Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. The Government requires delivery to be made, in the quantity within four (4) working days of placement of order. Because of research and changes in the numbers of animals on site, limited storage space and the fact that feed is dated, a minimum order quantity cannot be guaranteed at the time of each delivery request. Partial deliveries may be requested.</p>
<p>Deliveries shall be in clean, closed vehicles and unloaded at location specified by the NCAH. Bags shall be loaded and delivered on returnable or disposable pallets so that items can be unloaded by a Government forklift operator at the Government facility.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>FAR 52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (JUL 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at http://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<DESC>LAND BETWEEN THE LAKES GATE PAYMENT MACHINE REQUIREMENTS:
<p>EXISTING SITE CONDITIONS:</p>
<p>Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, managed by the USDA Forest Service, is needing to replace an existing remote pay-per-entry machine at its Elk and Bison Prairie facility. The current machine was set up to take cash, credit card, and/or pre-programmed magnetic stripe cards for visitors to gain entry to the facility. Proper payment allows the 12' lift arm to open, which then closes once the buried magnetic sensor senses that the vehicle has cleared the arm's pathway.</p>
<p>The current system (Standard Change Machine, GXP Model) contains a computer board that connects to a remote computer at our administration office via cellular connection. The two computers can update each other, and are primarily used to set gate opening and closing times (to limit public entry after hours) and to keep track of and validate each pre-paid magnetic stripe card number.<br />The computer at the Administration office uses the program AccessIT Universal to manage thousands of these mag-stripe cards. Credit card payments are processed thorough the Verizon cellular connection and deposited directly into a US Treasury bank account.</p>
<p>The current setup to be replaced is spread into two different control boxes, one containing the payment options for the visitors, and the other unit containing the communications equipment along with an AC/Heater unit.</p>
<p>The current setup utilizes two lift-arm gates to control ingress and egress. These are Federal APD (Federal Signal Corporation) Model G-90 Auto Gates. Only one of those units is connected to the pay-per-entry machine to control entry. The other unit is simply controlled by magnetic loop sensors that activate the gate to open and close as visitors exit. These may also be replaced at a later date as funds become available. The new Gate Payment Machine must be integrated to work with the existing on-site entrance gate lift arm gate controller to allow visitor access.</p>
<p>The current site has the following features:<br />&bull; Standard 120 volt AC line (may produce 110- 120 volts at plug/wire terminals) supplied through underground conduit.<br />&bull; NO data lines or phone lines.<br />&bull; ONLY Verizon cellular access, as others are too distant to provide suitable signal.<br />&bull; Concrete island for mounting free-standing units.<br />&bull; Asphalt driveway covering sensor wires.<br />&bull; OUTSIDE- this site is completely exposed to weather and sunlight with NO overhead cover.<br />&bull; Aspect- the installed machine will face South (full sun exposure on visual readouts).</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS FOR GATE PAYMENT MACHINE</p>
<p>The Government realizes that not all of the requested features may be available from certain manufacturers; however some of the requested features are requirements that must be met. Vendors should determine what is possible using their available equipment and technological or personnel limitations. Bids will be weighed against requirements. Technical is more important than price, technical combined with past performance is more important than price. Mandatory requirements (M) and Optional (O) requirements.</p>
<p>Enclosure and Mounting:</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine can be either electrically operated using 110 -120 volt standard AC line or the machine may be battery operated with solar recharging system attached; however, instruction must be provided with units on how to properly ground and buffer/gap all components to protect from nearby lightning strikes. The current location has been damaged by lightning strikes through the following underground routes: electric lines, gate communication/ sensor wires, and data lines.</p>
<p>(M) Unit must be securely mounted to heavy gauge steel base/stand which must be securely connected to a cement base material during installation (securely bolted into the existing cement traffic island). This base should be appealing to the eye and should fit well with the main machine. Bolts that secure the sections of the unit together and to the ground must not be accessible from the outside of the machine (to prevent theft of the entire unit).</p>
<p>(M) Unit itself must be enclosed in a high security stainless steel case which prevents theft of the contents and prevents theft of the entire unit, and holds up well to vandalism, while still being easy enough for employees to access the contents for service.</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine must have all components used for payment processing and communications located within the same unit/box. If a separate communications/computer box must be used, then it should also be easily disconnected and moved for service- bolts used to attach device(s) must be protected from the general public but accessible to employees from inside the unit to allow easy unbolting for removal. This separate box must also be contained in a strong secure steel enclosure.</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine must be installed to be easily unbolted from the base stand and disconnected from electrical and data lines to allow entire unit to be removed for transport to a service location. The Gate Payment Machine (and any separate communications/computer device) must work properly when they are removed from the mounting platforms/boxes and reconnected to a power supply elsewhere so they can be serviced wherever they are taken (cell services included when carrier signal is available). This allows local maintenance personnel to take the unit to a service location for repair as it is difficult to obtain on-site repairs at our remote location in a timely manner.</p>
<p>(M) If heating or cooling or dehumidifiers are needed for this equipment to work properly in an unprotected outside environment, they must be included with the unit and installation and warranted.</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine must be installed at a height and distance from the curb to allow access from vehicle windows for visitors to reach all the needed components. The Government realizes that not all vehicles can be accommodated; however an industry standard installation height for this type of curb-side device should be used. Vehicles of all sizes and shapes will be using the payment lane; therefore, no extended overhang or awning can be attached to the gate payment machine as this would be impacted by vehicles frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communications and Funds Processing:</p>
<p>(M) New Gate Payment Machine must be connected to and be compatible with our existing Verizon cellular 4G gateway device for processing credit card payments. The device is a Sierra Wireless Airlink RV50.</p>
<p>(M) The Gate Payment Machine must allow different methods for accessing the Facility, including:<br />&bull; Credit Card (including chipped cards). Chipped cards should not require PIN entry to validate as the process takes too long and requires a keypad. Reader system must work with Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards.<br />&bull; Cash (bills only)<br />&bull; Bar Code Scanner for reading and interpreting thousands of single-use visitor passes and gift cards<br />&bull; A method that allows for employee entry using a more permanent/durable bar coded card or RFID- chipped card or inexpensive &lsquo;fob'.</p>
<p>Credit card transactions do not need to provide receipts (we do not want them due to maintenance of printer and receipt paper issues)</p>
<p>Cash and Credit Card transactions will be for a single entry price, so no specific selections will need to be made for entry. Cash transactions will use bills only, no coins.</p>
<p>(M) Cash validator must be able to read bills in at least two feed directions (usually face up inserted at either end of bill), and should be a high quality unit that limits jams in all weather conditions. Validator bill box should hold a minimum of 700 bills;</p>
<p>(O) A 1000 bill unit is preferred especially if Hamilton TokeNotes are to be used.</p>
<p>(M) The Gate Payment Machine must be capable of sending notices, such as problem-specific text messages, to certain programmable phone numbers when the machine is having a problem, such as cash jams, loss of cellular service, out of change, and other common problems.</p>
<p>(M) The Gate Payment Machine must be accessible through internet portal, or similar off-site computer for maintenance monitoring, programming of weekly opening/closing times, or programming and deletion of passes, if possible. When the off-site communication connections are unresponsive, there must also be an easy method for directly connecting to the Gate Payment Machine to perform these actions.<br />OR<br />If above is not possible to perform remotely, then there must be an on-site access port/plug-in to allow use of a laptop or other compatible device to quickly download updates and settings listed above. (there is no building on-site to sit down and spend time programming things into the Gate Payment Machine in real time). If additional external devices or software are needed to perform these actions listed above, include those in the quote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Monetary Entry Options:</p>
<p>Regarding these options: (M)<br />&bull; Bar Code Scanner for reading and interpreting thousands of individually-coded single-use visitor passes and gift cards<br />&bull; A method that allows for employee entry using a more permanent/durable bar coded card or RFID- chipped card or inexpensive &lsquo;fob'. Using RIFD instead of bar codes would help simplify keeping staff passes separate from visitor cards and their different limited access times as all bar-coded cards could be limited to single-use.</p>
<p>(O) An option for visitor passes might include something like Hamilton TokenNotes; however, due to the exposed location there may be an issue with validator jams during wet weather; while a bar code scanner may work more trouble-free when printed on waterproof paper passes.</p>
<p>(M) For the visitor passes and gift cards listed above, a method must be provided to easily program individual consecutive bar codes into the Gate Payment Machine in bulk, as well as individually. The machine must be able to either keep the pass to gain entry, or automatically invalidate the pass once it has been used. Employees must be able to see if individual passes have been used or not to see if they are still valid or if we need to delete outdated passes from the system.</p>
<p>(O) The system must be able to handle at least 20,000 individually-coded passes, if possible.</p>
<p>(M) For employee entry cards/RFID devices, a method must be provided to easily program those into the Gate Payment Machine individually. These must be individually identified items that can be removed from the system when needed to prevent employee access.</p>
<p>(M) Employee access to the Facility must be programmable to allow a certain time period of entry; typically allowing 24-hour access for some, or visitor access hours for others.</p>
<p>(M) Visitor access to the Facility must be programmable to allow a certain time period of entry; typically sunrise to sunset entry periods are used and reset on a weekly schedule by on-site staff. This limitation must be easily programmable to stop bar coded card access, cash processing, and credit card processing activities during the &lsquo;no visitor entry' time periods.</p>
<p>(M) The Government would want to be able to purchase bar-coded cards with custom graphics/artwork from an aftermarket vendor, then program the sequential numbers for the bar codes into the Gate Payment Machine.</p>
<p>(O) If possible, the government would also purchase premade RFID-encoded cards/passes from an aftermarket vendor as well.</p>
<p>(O) The Gate Payment Machine should have a security camera option (include extra option prices in quote). These images should be viewable from an off-site computer, such as through an internet site, or by having the off-site computer connect to the Gate Payment Machine through the cellular connection to download the images/videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(O) The Gate Payment Machine should have a communication call button option (include extra option prices in quote). This option should allow visitors to push the button to communicate through the cellular connection with a telephone number at our visitor center, or other programmed number. If the option requires a different form of communication, such as radio signal, include the range and equipment requirements for this option in the quote.</p>
<p>Machine Design/Layout/Graphics:</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine will need to have graphics and digital/LCD readouts that are easy for the general public to understand how to use it. Design will have to be pre-approved by the Government before installation.</p>
<p>(O) A digital file of the graphics layout with machine component cutouts should be provided to the Government so that custom graphics can be designed and added at a later time if the Government decides to use an aftermarket vendor.</p>
<p>(M) Unused components for this specific setup/configuration, such as the change slots, should be neatly/ seamlessly covered so that the public will not try to use them. Some items that extend from the unit's face, such as coin slots with a bottom tray/bowl, may need to be removed before covering. Related lettering on the graphics should also be removed/neatly covered for these unused components to prevent confusion for the visitor.</p>
<p>(M) Digital, LCD, and/or Visual Display Screens should provide the visitor with easy to follow instructions to guide them through the transaction process.</p>
<p>(O) Different versions may be available for the model quoted, so provide the various options and their prices in the quote so that the Government can decide on which it prefers for this installation.</p>
<p>(M) The face of the machine will face South, therefore electronic displays must be properly designed and lighted to allow visitors to read the messages during any time of day, including in direct sunlight.</p>
<p>(O) Voice prompts are also desirable to help guide visitors through the transaction process and should be included in the quote.</p>
<p>(M) All readouts and voices must be in clearly understandable English. If options are available for visitors to select other languages on-site, then list those options in the quote.</p>
<p>(O) Exterior graphics facing incoming traffic should encourage the visitor to pull up to the front of the machine to begin the process of entering the facility; in other words, so new visitors should know what the machine is there to do for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Service, Parts, and Warranties:</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine and internal components and software must be of current production and warrantied against defects.</p>
<p>(M) Gate Payment Machine and internal components must be in new, unused condition (not previously owned or display models should be provided), with full factory warranties intact. This excludes the existing Airlink RV50 gateway device and Verizon setup which will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>(M) Parts and assembled components must be easy to obtain quickly for repairs</p>
<p>(M) Distance to qualified and authorized repair/service company for this assembled Gate Payment Machine must be within 250 driving miles maximum from 100 Van Morgan Drive, Golden Pond, Kentucky, 42211 (a Cadiz, KY zip code).</p>
<p>(M) Service and repair personnel must be easy to reach by phone or email during weekdays without long delays waiting for responses.</p>
<p>(M) Technical support for the Gate Payment Machine should be available for over the phone support to help local on-site staff figure out simple issues and troubleshooting. If there is an extra fee for this service, list those prices, and if this type of technical support will be provided by the vendor, machine manufacturer, or other service staff company.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. Technically acceptable is more than cost or price. Technically acceptable combined with past performance is more than cost or price.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>252.204-7011&nbsp; ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).&nbsp; The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.&nbsp; The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.&nbsp; The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.&nbsp; The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.&nbsp; This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be:NOAA/PMEL Campus Seattle, WA <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) is issuing solicitation HSHQPD-17-R-00002 for an SBA 8(a) competitive award of an IDIQ contract to a single source. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with non-commercial procedures outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 15 and 19.8 for the re-competition of all Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) services of the PIADC, also known as the Center-wide Support Program (CWSP). These services include animal care, operations, maintenance, business administration, technical services (e.g. biosafety and environmental), health clinic services, science and operational procurements, and fuels management.
<p>The Government anticipates the primary type of contract used for this requirement will be a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF), with proportionately smaller Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) type effort.</p>
<p>The majority of work to be performed under this contract will be issued through the first Task Order, for "core services" with anticipated period of performance to include a Base Year Period and Nine (9) 12-month option periods. A 90 day transition period will be part of the Base Year. Future Task Orders may be issued for "non-core services" projects for which the Government cannot predetermine the precise quantities nor the time period for delivery. Pending funding availability, the Contracting Officer will have the option to issue the resultant task orders as a FFP, T&amp;M, CPFF, and/or CPAF, depending on the nature and complexity of the work defined under the Task Order.</p>
<p>A mandatory 2-day pre-proposal site visit is part of this solicitation along with many other proposal submittal requirements. Potential offerors are highly encouraged to carefully read the instructions in Section L, "Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offers".</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Change Request- CR and IGE are generated by the COR and entered in the Contract Workbook. COR will assign the Change request number.<br />4. COR provides copy of Change Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on CR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Change Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO</p>
<p>Change Request must be submitted by the COR to the contractor within 24 hours after responding to the CFR. Contractor must submit proposal to the Contracting Officer within 72 hours receipt of the Change Request.</p>
<p>A modification will be issued to incorporate and implement all changes made by change orders.</p>
<p><br />9. CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR. The COR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager.

THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS (OPAP) WAS ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE AGENCY PROTEST ISSUES AND RESOLVE THEM WITHOUT EXPENSIVE AND TIME- CONSUMING LITIGATION. OPAP IS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEWING AUTHORITY THAT IS EMPOWERED TO GRANT A PREVAILING PROTESTER ESSENTIALLY THE SAME RELIEF AS THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO).
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS WITHIN THE USCG AS AN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) FORUM RATHER THAN FILING A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR SOME EXTERNAL FORUM. INTERESTED PARTIES MAY SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS INFORMALLY OR OPT TO FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR OMBUDSMAN.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. INTERESTED PARTIES WHO BELIEVE A SPECIFIC USCG PROCUREMENT IS UNFAIR OR OTHERWISE DEFECTIVE SHOULD FIRST DIRECT THEIR CONCERNS TO THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTING OFFICER. IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IS UNABLE TO SATISFY THEIR CONCERNS, INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THE U.S. COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN FOR AGENCY PROTESTS. UNDER THIS INFORMAL PROCESS THE AGENCY IS NOT REQUIRED TO SUSPEND CONTRACT AWARD PERFORMANCE. USE OF AN INFORMAL FORUM DOES NOT SUSPEND ANY TIME REQUIREMENT FOR FILING A PROTEST WITH THE AGENCY OR OTHER FORUM. IN ORDER TO ENSURE A TIMELY RESPONSE, INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO THE OMBUDSMAN: SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NUMBER, CONTRACTING OFFICE, CONTRACTING OFFICER, AND SOLICITATION CLOSING DATE (IF APPLICABLE).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. PRIOR TO SUBMITTING A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST, PROTESTERS MUST FIRST USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THROUGH OPEN AND FRANK DISCUSSIONS. IF THE PROTESTER'S CONCERNS ARE UNRESOLVED, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS AVAILABLE BY THE OMBUDSMAN. THE PROTESTER MAY FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST TO EITHER THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT, THE OMBUDSMAN UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM. CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE WILL BE SUSPENDED DURING THE PROTEST PERIOD UNLESS CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE IS JUSTIFIED, IN WRITING, FOR URGENT AND COMPELLING REASONS OR IS DETERMINED IN WRITING TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE AGENCY'S GOAL IS TO RESOLVE PROTESTS IN LESS THAN 35 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FILING. PROTESTS SHALL INCLUDE THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN FAR 33.103(D) (2). IF THE PROTESTER FAILS TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION, RESOLUTION OF THE PROTEST MAY BE DELAYED OR THE PROTEST MAY BE DISMISSED. TO BE TIMELY PROTESTS MUST BE FILED WITHIN THE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN FAR 33.103(E). FORMAL PROTESTS FILED UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO OPAP@USCG.MIL AND THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR BY HAND DELIVERY TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.</p>
<p>ELECTION OF FORUM. AFTER AN INTERESTED PARTY PROTESTS A COAST GUARD PROCUREMENT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR THE OMBUDSMAN, AND WHILE THE PROTEST IS PENDING, THE PROTESTER AGREES NOT TO FILE A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR OTHER EXTERNAL FORUM. IF THE PROTEST IS FILED WITH AN EXTERNAL FORUM, THE AGENCY PROTEST WILL BE DISMISSED.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Pakistan Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Pakistan (PAK), Middle East (ME), and Europe and Asia (EA). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in Pakistan, supervising program teams in Washington, DC and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs. The Pakistan Team Leader will insure that U.S. Government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practices and U.S. Government policy.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Regional Team Leader requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of programs, funds and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Regional Team Leader is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor.

(1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or 
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements; 
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;

(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and 
(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery. <BR> <BR>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority. See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999). (b) Agency protests filed with the Contracting Officer shall be sent to the following address: [Insert Contracting Officer name and Address] (c) Agency protests filed with the agency Protest Decision Authority shall be sent to the following address: [Insert appropriate Protest Decision Authority name and Address] (d) A complete copy of all agency protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel within one day of filing a protest with either the Contracting Officer or the Protest Decision Authority.

Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) A protest may be filed with either the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims unless an agency protest has been filed. (b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) Investigative Requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts. All contractor (and subcontractor) personnel proposed to be employed under a High or Moderate Risk contract shall undergo security processing by the Department's Office of Security before being eligible to work on the premises of any Department of Commerce owned, leased, or controlled facility in the United States or overseas, or to obtain access to a Department of Commerce IT system. All Department of Commerce security processing pertinent to this contract will be conducted at no cost to the contractor. The level of contract risk will determine the type and scope of such processing, as noted below. (1) Investigative requirements for Non-IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk?Moderate Background Investigation (MBI). (2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (b) In addition to the investigations noted above, non-U.S. citizens must have a pre-appointment check that includes an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. (c) Additional Requirements for Foreign Nationals (Non-U.S. Citizens). To be employed under this contract within the United States, non-U.S. citizens must have: (1) Official legal status in the United States; (2) Continuously resided in the United States for the last two years; and (3) Obtained advance approval from the servicing Security Officer of the contracting operating unit in consultation with the DOC Office of Security (OSY) headquarters. (OSY routinely consults with appropriate agencies regarding the use of non-U.S. citizens on contracts and can provide up-to-date information concerning this matter.) <BR> <BR>(d) Security Processing Requirement. Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems. Contract employees may be barred from working on the premises of a facility for any of the following: (1) Conviction of a felony crime of violence or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (2) Falsification of information entered on security screening forms or on other documents submitted to the Department; (3) Improper conduct once performing on the contract, including criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct or other conduct prejudicial to the Government, regardless of whether the conduct was directly related to the contract; (4) Any behavior judged to pose a potential threat to Departmental information systems, personnel, property, or other assets. (f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-17-Q-J00027 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-92 effective 18 November 2016.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<p>All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), EFW Incorporated (EFW). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or OEM authorized distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that IE is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OneSAF is the US Army's next generation Constructive, entity level Computer Generated Forces/Semi-Automated Forces (CGF/SAF).  Training providers and Warfighters greatly benefit from accurate authoritative data to represent the operational environment.  Multiple scenario data generation systems exist; however, it is difficult to find, obtain, and reuse data.  The Army requires new and agile processes to pull data from the numerous data sources available to facilitate the building of accurate data bases.  The Enterprise Data Services (EDS) is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to assist with the discovery, use and re-use of data across both the DoD and Modeling &Simulation (M&S)  communities with a goal to provide a M&S enterprise common data production environment that brokers access to distributed cross-community and cross-Service data discovery, retrieval, and enhancement capabilities through enterprise web service.  <br>    <br>  The current ONESAF operates in a Government leased space.  With the future effort, it is anticipated for EDS to formulate a larger portion of the requirements.  Along with the addition of EDS, it is desired to have the PEO Government workforce residing in non-leased space.

<DESC>*****NOTE All slots for face to face One On One Discussions are full.  A session of 15 minute One On One Discussions is added for Monday June 1st from 2pm to 4pm. <br>  <br>  <br> *****NOTE Change in Contracting Officer, time length of One On One Discussions is reduced to 15 minutes, and removal of SAM management number required for submission.  <br>    <br>    <br> *****NOTE Change of Date for Industry Day.  Industry day is now Friday May 29th, 2015 from 9am to 11 am.  Location unchanged.   <br>      <br>   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:     <br>        <br>   The U.S. Army PEO STRI is seeking capability information from industry for consideration during development of an acquisition strategy to obtain necessary personnel, material, equipment, facilities, and services to execute the One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Integration, interoperability and support (I2S) and Production activities as well as the Enterprise Data Services (EDS) software development and support activities.  OneSAF is the US Army's next generation Constructive, entity level Computer Generated Forces/Semi-Automated Forces (CGF/SAF).  Training providers and Warfighters greatly benefit from accurate authoritative data to represent the operational environment.  Multiple scenario data generation systems exist; however, it is difficult to find, obtain, and reuse data.  The Army requires new and agile processes to pull data from the numerous data sources available to facilitate the building of accurate data bases.  The Enterprise Data Services (EDS) is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to assist with the discovery, use and re-use of data across both the DoD and Modeling &Simulation (M&S)  communities with a goal to provide a M&S enterprise common data production environment that brokers access to distributed cross-community and cross-Service data discovery, retrieval, and enhancement capabilities through enterprise web service.    <br>        <br>    The current ONESAF operates in a Government leased space.  With the future effort, it is anticipated for EDS to formulate a larger portion of the requirements.  Along with the addition of EDS, it is desired to have the PEO Government workforce residing in non-leased space.

Location unchanged.    <br>        <br>    PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:      <br>          <br>    The U.S. Army PEO STRI is seeking capability information from industry for consideration during development of an acquisition strategy to obtain necessary personnel, material, equipment, facilities, and services to execute the One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Integration, interoperability and support (I2S) and Production activities as well as the Enterprise Data Services (EDS) software development and support activities.  OneSAF is the US Army's next generation Constructive, entity level Computer Generated Forces/Semi-Automated Forces (CGF/SAF).  Training providers and Warfighters greatly benefit from accurate authoritative data to represent the operational environment.  Multiple scenario data generation systems exist; however, it is difficult to find, obtain, and reuse data.  The Army requires new and agile processes to pull data from the numerous data sources available to facilitate the building of accurate data bases.  The Enterprise Data Services (EDS) is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to assist with the discovery, use and re-use of data across both the DoD and Modeling &Simulation (M&S)  communities with a goal to provide a M&S enterprise common data production environment that brokers access to distributed cross-community and cross-Service data discovery, retrieval, and enhancement capabilities through enterprise web service.     <br>          <br>     The current ONESAF operates in a Government leased space.  With the future effort, it is anticipated for EDS to formulate a larger portion of the requirements.  Along with the addition of EDS, it is desired to have the PEO Government workforce residing in non-leased space.  As such, the requirements below regarding contractor owned/leased and managed facilities are desirable in support of this RFI.     <br>          <br>     The following identifies the business areas for which the requirements apply:      <br>          <br>      	Modeling, architecting, and engineering activities supporting development and maintenance.     <br>          <br>      	Develop and support enterprise data services to support data discovery, retrieval, and enhancement services.     <br>          <br>      	Incrementally build a service-oriented DoD data enterprise that will enable the rapid discovery, retrieval, and reuse of data and services across the spectrum of M&S communities.     <br>          <br>      	Develop of data enhancement services data tools for enterprise data services.     <br>          <br>      	Integration, interoperability, and support services as well as system testing activities in house and on site.     <br>          <br>      	Development and support for cloud enabled approach to enable the discovery, use, and re-use of data for OneSAF and M&S Communities (Planning, Analysis, Acquisition, Training, Intelligence, Experimentation, and Test and Evaluation).     <br>          <br>      	Training OneSAF products and providing supplemental training aids to support training needs to OneSAF user community.     <br>          <br>      	Distribution and support of products and tools to 200+ DOD, Joint service, and international sites and users worldwide.     <br>          <br>      	Help Desk support activities to include telephonic support, e-mail support, and exercise support.     <br>          <br>      	Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) updates and distribution to development environment and supported sites.      <br>          <br>      	Facility to conduct development, integration, and testing.     <br>          <br>      	GFE, GFP, and equipment management at a contractor owned and managed location.     <br>          <br>      	Facility must be capable of supporting development and storage of both unclassified and classified material.     <br>          <br>      	Facility to support the handling, storage, and development of software in a connected Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on both unclassified and classified networks.     <br>          <br>          <br>     Services and Products to include:     <br>          <br>     (1)		Object Oriented Software Development.     <br>          <br>     (2)		Conceptual Modeling, Software Architecture, and Systems Engineering.     <br>          <br>     (3)		Integration, interoperability, test, and support.     <br>          <br>     (4)		Information technology (IT) duties and IDE and secure lab management and sustainment.     <br>          <br>     (5)		Configuration Management of distributed OneSAF software.     <br>          <br>     (6)		Developer and user training activities as well as fielding support.     <br>          <br>     (7)		Mission Command (MC) interface development and integration.     <br>          <br>     (8)		Synthetic Environment development and support.     <br>          <br>     (9)		IAVA Patch Management, consisting of consolidation and distribution to the field after successful testing.     <br>          <br>     (10)	Tele-training/teleconferencing.     <br>          <br>     (11)	Exercise technical support.     <br>          <br>     (12)	Exercise operational support (tying the software to the training objectives).     <br>          <br>     (13)	GFE, GFP, and equipment management at a contractor owned and managed location.     <br>          <br>     (14)	Processing, handling, and storage of classified and unclassified data.     <br>          <br>     (15)	Cloud/Web-based interface and portal development.     <br>          <br>     (16)	Development on both classified and unclassified networks.     <br>          <br>     MARKET RESEARCH APPROACH:      <br>          <br>     The Government anticipates an award in 1QFY17.

<DESC><strong>This notification was canceled and replaced with DOLJ11UA00033</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />The Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA) intends to award a cost-reimbursement plus fixed fee bridge contract to a single source. The statutory authority permitting this acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 USC 254(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The period of performance for this contract will be:<br /></span>Contract Base Period: February 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018<br />Option 1: February 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018</p>
<p>This contract will be awarded on or about 1 February 2017, to Alutiiq Education &amp; Training LLC. under its current contract.</p>
<p>The prospective contractor shall continue to provide this Job Corps Center with 24-hour, 7 days per week operations that provides essential residential (including food and shelter), medical, education, training and career transition support to the students participating in the Job Corps program. The contract will enable the provision of these critical services through the continued operation of the Job Corps center.</p>
<p>DOL intends to award this requirement as a sole source to Alutiiq Education &amp; Training LLC. since the services are follow-on from a current contract award and awarding to another source would cause unacceptable delays/gaps in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract. It is the government's intent to compete the services in the near future and award a new contract no later than July 31, 2018.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611519 with the size standard of $38.5 million.</p>
<p>This is a sole source notice published for informational purposes only and not a request for competitive proposals. Therefore, no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, all responsible parties interested in responding to this notice are invited to submit a capability statement including costs by 12:00 pm ET, December 23, 2016, that provides sufficient details for consideration by the government, via email to Fryerscott.joy.v@dol.gov. The determination not to compete the contract based on the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <br /><br />All questions or comments regarding this notice shall be addressed in writing to:<br />Hameena Heard<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />Department of Labor (DOL) <br />Room 7M70<br />61 Forsyth St., SW.,<br />Atlanta, GA 30303-8930</p>

A sources sought notice was posted on 8 November 2016 under synopsis N40085-17-R-0309 to determine
availability and capability of small businesses to perform the requirement.
 Based on market research results,
the procurement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis with full and open competition. NAVFAC Mid-
Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with the determination to solicit as an unrestricted
procurement.

Project Description:

The proposed requirement is a two-phase Design-Build project that will repair and upgrade Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) Building 3606 by eliminating all Q4
Condition and/or Configuration ratings to bring these facilities up to a Q1 rating to comply with the Defense
Planning Guidance. All major building systems are substandard and need replacement. Facility repairs will
meet current code requirements and correct existing deficiencies.
 Room layouts will be reconfigured to
provide two separate baths and service areas (2+0 concept) in lieu of one shared bath for two rooms; remove
and replace two closets to fit the reconfigured space. This project will inspect, replace or repair the existing
sanitary waste drain lines in the laundry room in building 3606A. All existing sanitary sewer piping in 3606
will be replaced. Electrical breaker panels will be replaced as required to handle the electrical load. The
existing 3606 building ventilation system and ducts will be replaced. The facility will be brought up to all
Antiterrorism /Force Protection (ATFP) standards in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-
01 including progressive collapse.
 The exterior walls of the buildings will be power washed and a mold
growth inhibitor paint applied. All emergency lighting and exit signs will be replaced with energy efficient
stainless steel fixtures with a protective metal cage placed around them to prevent vandalism. Additional
video security cameras will be provided to for security coverage to all blind areas and the existing security
monitoring system will be upgraded as required to handle the cameras. The existing trash dumpster
enclosures will be replaced with higher side walls and lockable gates. The deteriorated elevators will be
replaced and security cameras will be provided. The current fire alarm and detection system does not meet
current standards and must be replaced to bring these buildings in compliance with current life safety codes
and UFC-3-600-01.
 Properly sized natural gas potable hot water boilers will be provided in 3606B to supply
the domestic hot water requirements of 3606 and 3606A. Landscaping site improvements will be incorporated in this project.

The project replaces the existing 2-pipe heating and cooling system in buildings 3606 and 3606A and
provides temporary heating and cooling for building 3609 until a project for building 3609 is programmed. The
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and direct digital controls (DDC) used should be the
most energy efficient system possible, but natural gas was used for planning and estimating purposes.
Alternative types of energy efficient HVAC systems will be taken into consideration with the goal to meet the
reduced energy consumption mandates.

Building 3606 is a five-story, 91,000 SF BEQ built in 1989 and building 3606A is a 7,680 SF BEQ support
building built in 1989.
 The scope of work includes replacing the mechanical system in building 3606B for
buildings 3606 and 3606A. These buildings are constructed so that the mechanical systems are
interconnected. This project will remove this interconnection so as to provide each building with an
independent mechanical system. This will allow isolation of each in case of an outage or necessary repairs.
The work also includes all incidental work to make the HVAC system functional. All facilities will include
cybersecurity commissioning for infrastructure systems such as Direct Digital (DDC) controls, fire alarm and
detection and security monitoring systems.

This project will install a complete and useable fire sprinkler system and a roof replacement in building
3606B.

The estimated construction cost is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

The anticipated award of this contract is June 2017.

The completion time for this contract is 572 calendar days after award.

The specifications for this project will be posted with the solicitation and are not available at this time.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220, Commercial and
Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $36.5 million.

<DESC>QUESTIONS

  Regarding the RFQ for the referenced project, will there be requirements for an Industrial Hygienist and Commissioning?

The IH and commission are required because of potential asbestos, and lead paint. Commissioning is desired and required when you are designing and constructing negative/positive HVAC spaces that need to be fully balanced and controllable.  


  Also is there an ERCP/Endoscopy Procedure Room that would require a mobile C-arm and calculations of a physicist?
No.

<DESC>Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 05   Page 1 of 1
Original Date: 03/22/11
Revision 05 Date: 05/02/2016
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
636-17-1-025-0001
1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Firm Fixed Price Order for lease of Exactamix 1200 TPN Compounder.  Order is for base year plus 4 option years.  This compounder is specifically designed to be used with the Baxter TPN bags and associated tubing, and medications currently used by the facility.  Cost per year is _______, total for base plus four years is ________.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
The Omaha Pharmacy currently utilizes the Baxter Exactamix 1200 TPN compounder for inpatient care.  The facility uses TPN bags, tubing, and medications that are specifically designed to fit and work with this compounder.  Baxter Healthcare is the manufacturer of the compounder, medications, and operating supplies and does not have any authorized resellers of this equipment.  This equipment allows the VA to only purchase the base drugs and adjust quantities of the drugs per patient needs.  Switching to a different compounder system would necessitate switching from already purchased tubing, bags, and medications resulting in added costs.
 
4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS, VETBIZ, Open Market, SAM.  Baxter Healthcare is the manufacturer of the compounder and has no authorized resellers.  GSA search resulted in zero matches.  VETBIZ search for this item yielded zero matches.  Since the manufacturer stated there are no authorized resellers, no additional searches for small businesses was done. 
5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
