(CAGE: 11718), P/Ns EGR-7-434 &amp; M100100; and Enflite, Inc. (CAGE: 37EW8), P/N 89200-001. Solicitation SPM3SE-11-R-0008 has an expected issue date of June 21, 2011 and an estimated closing date of July 05, 2011. The solicitation will be issued under commercial acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12.
<p>2. This requirement is Unrestricted (not a set-aside for small business).</p>
<p>4. This solicitation describes the part-numbered item/product in accordance with two (2) cited manufacturers: (1) MGR Equipment Corp. (CAGE: 11718); and (2) Enflite, Inc. (CAGE: 37EW8). DLA Troop Support intends to procure this equipment in accordance with the exact MGR Equipment Corp. or Enflite, Inc. part numbers cited under the Item Description. No drawings will be provided, and the Government does not have adequate data available for evaluation of alternate offers. The Air Force is the design control, engineering service activity (ESA) for this refrigerator-freezer equipment item. Therefore, offerors' proposals based on material manufactured by a source other than the two (2) manufacturers cited in the Item Description and /or Statement of Work are required to obtain source approval from the Air Force. Source Approval Requests/technical data packages must be submitted to DLA Troop Support with the offer/proposal. <br />5. In addition, the time period before the proposed award of the current acquisition does not permit evaluation of alternate offers; and delay of award would adversely affect the Government. Therefore, any offer(s) of an alternate product will not be evaluated for the current acquisition, but will be evaluated for potential use on future procurements. Clause 52.217-9002 (DLAD), Conditions for Evaluation and Acceptance of Offers of Part Numbered Items, is included in the solicitation for purposes of informing offerors about the extent and level of data which must be submitted for evaluation of alternate offers.</p>
<p>6. The solicitation will result in a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite-Quantity Contract (IQC), with an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) provision with a one (1) base year, with the option to extend the contract for each of four (4), one-year option periods. It is anticipated that requisitions will be Customer Direct (DVD), CONUS locations.</p>
<p>7. The required delivery is 120. The Government may request accelerated delivery after placement of an order.</p>
<p>8. DLA Troop Support will evaluate offers independently using Best Value procedures. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the most advantageous, price and other than cost/price factors considered. Past performance will be a technical evaluation factor. The Government will perform a technical and price trade-off evaluation to determine which offer represents the "best value" to the Government. For this solicitation, price is more important than non- cost /price and technical factors. Evaluation factors for award are contained at 52.212-2 in the solicitation.</p>

<a href="mailto:Terri.Hand@navy.mil">Terri Hand </a>
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to enter into negotiations for a QTY of 1 each Fiber Placement Machine. The Contractor shall be responsible for design, manufacture, and delivery of a multi-axis 4-tow fiber placement machine capable of placing thermosetting resins with fiber to the Composites Lab (the Lab) at NAWCWD China Lake, CA. The Contractor shall oversee installation and setup of the fiber placement machine in the Lab, develop and implement checkout procedures to verify the capability of the machine after installation. The contractor will also train Lab personnel for 1 week minimum at NAWCWD in the proper use of the machine – to include safety, programming and hardware operation and furnish complete documentation including instruction manuals for the hardware and software, electrical wiring diagrams, mechanical interface drawings and applicable maintenance manuals.
 The machine must be capable of handling diameters from 1 inch up to 48 inches, flat surfaces, and concave and convex contours. Part length varies from 1 foot up to 10 feet. The machine shall accommodate tooling and parts up to 6000 lb total. It must be capable of handling most commercially available ATL-grade thermosetting resin and fiber systems, including fiberglass, graphite, Kevlar, epoxy, cyanate ester, bismaleimide, and polyimide. These materials may be in slit tape or tow-preg format in 0.250" tow/tape width. The head of the machine shall have a provision for being interchangeable to allow for use of other materials such as thermoplastics and phenolic tapes. The machine must have enough axes of motion to allow for fiber to be placed between 0 degree and 90 degree orientation to the longitudinal axis of the machine.
 The angle shall be adjustable in 1.0 degree increments at a minimum. The tows must be placed accurately with a tolerance of plus or minus 0.1 degree. The machine must be capable of mid-path fiber steering. The placement head shall be capable of independently feeding and placing up to 4 tows/tapes. The head must be capable of placing material as short as 2.0" in length, up to the entire length of the part (10 feet). The machines must use compaction to help hold the fibers in place with a compaction roller on the head capable of applying up to 200 lb to the part. The machine must have a provision for maintaining some tension on the fiber creels so that fouling of the fiber is avoided. The machine must have a method for tacking in place the composite material.
 The material does not need to be cured in place, but must hold shape through construction and transfer to an oven or autoclave. The machine must fit into a footprint of 20 feet long by 15 feet deep by 15 feet high. The existing facilities have electrical power available up to 200 Amp 480 VAC/ 3 phase, as well as compressed air at ~100 psi maximum and ~500L/minute. 

The fiber placement machine shall include all control hardware and software. There are two essential pieces of software to be included with the system. First, there must be software to control the fiber placement hardware. The machine shall automatically control material feed rate, compaction roller pressure, quantity of tows, fiber angles, fiber lengths, tacking heat temperature, and machine axis speeds.
 Software to model fiber placement on the tool / mandrel is also required. The machine must have a method to either generate a model of the part and tool or accept standard CAD/CAM files of parts and tools. The software shall also provide an optimized layup schedule to reduce excessive buildups and minimize gaps. These models must be accurately transferred to the machine control software to maintain the layup pattern. The machine must have interfaces and controls for the operator. There shall be controls for axes, feed rates, tack temperature, compaction pressure, machine speed, and tow enable/disable. There shall also be a display on the machine to show the operator what the machine is doing.
 The display shall show in real time axial positions, estimated layer completion time, tack temperature, material feed rate, machine speed, compaction load and warnings/errors. There shall be manual control buttons to move axes of the machine outside of a software program running. The machine shall have hard or soft stops to prevent the head from crashing into any part of the frame. There shall also be soft stops to prevent the head from crashing into the tool/part. There must be emergency stops (E-stops) available for an operator to stop the machine from critical locations around the machine. These E-stops shall lock all axes, disable the tacking heat and compaction roller, shut out power to the head and turning chuck and bleed off air pressure.
	
The quotation will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online Website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://vsearch2.eps.gov/servlet/searchservlet.
