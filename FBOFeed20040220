<DESC>USAID/India is seeking proposals from qualified, responsible U. S. organizations interested in undertaking a Performance-Based ‘Management Contract’ under the Disaster Management Support (DMS) Project in India. To establish a Management Contractor whose goal is to help the USAID & GOI improve systems of disaster management at the national, state and local levels in India.  These systems will address not only natural disasters, but also man-made emergencies. 

The DMS Project will provide USAID/India with a linked set of mutually supportive activities that address the issues articulated above and contribute toward achieving the targeted results. The purpose of the DMS Project is to increase capacity in the Indian public and private sectors in all phases of the disaster cycle which will reduce vulnerability to disasters in high-risk areas.  Each component of the DMS Project will contribute through a holistic framework to the development of improved systems for disaster management in India. 

Major components of the DMS Project are:
1.Capacity Building in the Public Sector will focus on the enhancement of the capacities of the MHA to support state and local government entities, and other key related governmental units to ensure that disaster managers and decision makers will have the tools needed to prepare for, respond to, and develop plans for long-term mitigation of disasters. Some major sub-components are:

Incident Command System (ICS) for the improvement of on-site disaster response.   The U. S. Forest Service (USFS) is assisting the MHA to incorporate elements of the U. S. Incident Command System into the Indian disaster management system.

<CONTACT>Jagdeep Shah, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of silicon Electronic & Photonic Integrated Circuit (EPIC) Technology.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

The objective of the EPIC program is to demonstrate technology for monolithic integration of high performance photonics and electronics on a single Si chip in a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)-compatible process and to demonstrate functional, high performance EPIC chips with large scale photonic and electronic integration that have high potential for military applications.  A further objective of the program is to pursue the development of photonic devices that are not currently available in Si, including but not limited to light emitters and lasers, optical amplifiers and nonlinear optical devices such as wavelength converters in parallel.  The spectral region of interest is the extended communications band ranging from 1200 nm to 1700 nm.  

For the development of the EPIC chips and photonic devices, DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I.	CMOS-Compatible High Performance Si Nanophotonic Devices
The first major interest of the EPIC program is the development and demonstration of a complete suite of high performance Si nanophotonic devices and circuits fabricated in a CMOS-compatible process in a state-of-the-art, production-grade CMOS fab (fabrication facility).  The spectral region of interest for these devices is the extended communications band 1200 nm – 1700 nm.  This area of interest has three sub-tasks:
A.	Develop a design library for a comprehensive set of high performance Si nanophotonic devices and circuits that can be fabricated in a CMOS-compatible process;  
B.	Fabricate, in a state-of-the-art CMOS fabrication facility, a subset of devices necessary for realizing the AS-EPIC(s) to be demonstrated in the second area of interest described below; and  
C.	Demonstrate the photonic device and circuit performance required to realize the AS-EPIC to be demonstrated in the second area of interest below.  

II.	CMOS-compatible Application Specific Electronic and Photonic Integrated Circuits (AS-EPICs)
The second major area of interest is fabrication and demonstration of high performance Application Specific EPICs or AS-EPICs for applications especially relevant to DoD.  These EPIC chips will integrate the full set or a subset of photonic devices/circuits developed under area I of interest, as well as a full complement of electronic devices/circuits required for a functional AS-EPIC chip.  The offeror will select a specific application, discuss its relevance to military applications, and design, fabricate and demonstrate such high performance AS-EPICs.  If an offeror proposes to develop more than one type of AS-EPIC, the one of most interest should be proposed in the base program and others as options.  The proposal should explain in detail the benefits and impact of developing such AS-EPICs including, but not limited to, the benefits of integration of electronics and photonics on a single Si chip.  The goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to design, fabricate, and demonstrate a functional AS-EPIC, and to demonstrate a design and integration path to high performance AS-EPICs for DoD critical applications.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate DoD critical AS-EPIC(s) with performance exceeding the performance using typical discrete devices.  

III.	Novel Photonic Devices
The third area of interest for EPIC is the development of novel photonic devices that are not currently available in Si.  These include, but are not limited to, light emitters and lasers, wavelength converters and other nonlinear optical devices, and optical amplifiers.  The approaches proposed for these novel devices must be fully compatible with existing CMOS processing and the EPIC chips being developed in this Program.  

Integrated teams are strongly encouraged.  We envision that each team will address the first two areas of interest discussed above and form an integrated program leading to functional, high performance AS-EPICs.  Novel Photonic Devices under area III of interest can be proposed either within an integrated team or as an individual innovative proposal.   

The selected performers will be required to deliver individual devices and groups of devices (circuits) integrated on a chip that form a building block for AS-EPICs, and functional AS-EPICs at appropriate intervals within the program to a DARPA-designated facility.  Offerors are also asked to submit a list and timetable of deliverables. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 04-15 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below. 

PROGRAM SCOPE

The EPIC program will consist of an 18 month Phase I effort with a Go/No-Go critical demonstration at 16 months.  This will be followed by a 30-month Phase II with clearly stated, quantitative milestones at 12, 24 and 30 months into Phase II.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II should include it as an option in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to, design, fabrication, and integration are strongly encouraged.  The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator or small group efforts in the area of novel photonic devices.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Jagdeep Shah, phone: (703) 696-2253, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: jshah@darpa.mil.  

	GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 04-15, Electronic & Photonic Integrated Circuit (EPIC) Technology, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on the objectives of the EPIC BAA, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, the World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  An original and nine (9) copies of the full proposal as specified in the Proposer Information Pamphlet, along with two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 04-15) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, April 9, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Vehicles Directorate. Contracting Division (AFRL/VAK) intends to award a sole source contract to the Institute of Scientific Research, Inc., 320 Adams Street, PO Box 1148, Fairmont, WV, 26555-1148.  The proposed effort builds upon the software and hardware involved in a current effort between the ISR and AFRL/VA.    ISR was provided and is currently operating Air Force simulation equipment and software that is a critical element to this new phase of ongoing research.  Government furnished equipment that ISR is operating consists of a cockpit and a high-fidelity visual system that duplicates an identical system at AFRL/VA.  These two systems are connected together via an ISDN line and they are the only two systems of their kind.  In addition, due to the size, weight and fragile nature of the systems, this equipment is not easily moved to an alternate location.  Under the scope of this new effort with ISR, researchers will be exchanging simulation software that will be developed and tested in the two cockpits individually and jointly.  One of the issues that will be addressed is a thorough investigation of the affects of time delays and information losses between remote systems in simulation events.  Once the environment is thoroughly understood, joint simulation and development activities will use the cockpits and software to investigate new control algorithms and manned aircraft interactions with unmanned air vehicles.
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  If no written response is received by 08 Mar 04, to the effect that comparable items/services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these items/services through a sole-source procurement with ISR, a sole-source award will be made.   Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in San Diego, CA in support of Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare, PMS 183, requires successful completion of the Advanced Deployable System (ADS) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase for the development of a planned Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) deployable system.  The Contractor will develop the system and interface specifications, perform the preliminary and critical design engineering, procure and manufacture the required test articles, conduct design verification and system integration testing, and deliver the equipment required to conduct operational testing of the LCS-deployable system in FY08.  The new contract will need to include the following deliverables: the complete technical data package and test articles sufficient to evaluate the system design.  The contractor will integrate previously developed arrays and processing with the development of communication and installation sub system.  The contractor will also need to conduct various engineering support efforts and trade studies and will deliver those on an as required basis.  It is expected that the contract will have two options for Low Rate Initial Production to include the production of one complete ship set under each option.  The Government believes that Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems & Sensors Undersea Systems, of Manassas, VA with their previous experience with the ADS program is the only contractor that can accomplish these requirements without substantial duplication of cost that would not be expected to be recovered thru competition and without unacceptable delays.  It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded in June 2004 with completion of all testing by March 2008 and delivery of all LRIP materials by September 2009.  The value of this contract is expected to be approximately $215,000,000.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541710.  Please see Numbered Note 22. Responses to this announcement should be addressed to Pamela Rose at pamela.rose@navy.mil.

After initial offers or quotes are evaluated as described in the Evaluation of Offers provisions of this solicitation, the Contracting Officer may proceed with the DPE process.

FISC San Diego or Procuri.com will provide training on the Dynamic Pricing Event process and the details pertaining to this solicitation DPE. Written information not contained or attached to this solicitation that concerns the Dynamic Pricing Event may be provided to each participating offeror or quoter as part of their training. 4. Procuri.com and Government Trainer Interaction with Offerors.

Such communication shall not be considered discussions with the Offerors or Quoters  within the meaning set forth in FAR Part 15. C. DURING THE DPE 1. Discussions. The DPE shall be considered the opening of discussions as defined at FAR Part 15.306(d). Offerors or Quoters may, but are not required to, revise their initial pricing proposal or quotation during the DPE. Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE. Offerors or Quoters shall not submit revised pricing via any other mechanism including (but not limited to) post, courier, fax, e-mail, or orally unless specifically authorized by t he Contracting Officer (see paragraph D for further details). 2. DPE Connection. The invited Offerors or Quoters shall be provided the opportunity to connect to the Procuri.com website (www.govauctions.procuri.com) via Internet connection. Offerors or Quoters will register for the scheduled event using the Procuri.co m software solution. Offerors or Quoters shall be responsible for providing their own computer system and connecting to the telecommunications service used for each DPE via their own Internet Service Provider (ISP). 3.

If an offer or quote is submitted within the last 5 minutes of the time period, the DPE period shall be extended for an additional 5 minutes, if the offer/quote is the lowest price received. The time shall be extended for an unlimited number of 5 minute extension periods, if a lower offer/quote is submitted within the last 5 minutes. The final price revision submitted during the DPE will be considered the Offerors Final Price Proposal (see D.1 below for additional information). 4. Problems. Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately. A  problem is an event that interferes with the Offerors ability to participate in the DPE and includes, but is not limited to, Internet connection and re-connection difficulties, (2) software or hardware failures, and (3) erroneous data entry errors. Offerors will have 10 minutes after the DPE goes into the Quiet Period status to notify the Contracting Office of any problems. The name and phone number of the FISC San Diego Contract Specialist who will be available for assistance during the DPE will be provided to each invited offeror prior to the starting time and date of the event. If the Contracting Officer judges that any offeror is disadvantaged by the identified problem, Procuri.com and FISC San Diego may, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, correct the problem, pause and may reopen the DPE, or cancel the DPE.  D. AFTER THE DPE 1. Closing Price Discussions. D iscussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2. No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3. Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be s ent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system. End of Clauses/Provisions.

<DESC>SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston intends to award a sole-source contract to Radeco, LLC, 509 Norwich Avenue, Taftville, CT 06380-1343 to provide Battery Powered Air Particle Samplers.  General Specifications: a. The Model H-809B2 Battery Powered Portable Air Sampler is used for collecting air particulate samples in areas where electrical power is not conveniently located.  Its sampling capability will vary according to the free filter area and type of filter media used.  For example, from a single full battery charge using 50 mm diameter filter paper, a cumulative sampling volume of 10 to 12 cubic meters may be expected when sampling normal atmospheric air. A high density filter and cartridge will reduce the total sample volume to 4 to 5 cubic meters. b.The Model H-809B2 consists of a dual-stage turbine blower direct coupled to a DC motor, and an accurate electronic timer-controller, all powered by a single rechargeable spill-proof battery.

The Ordnance Destruct System must be capable of interfacing with MMODS kits delivered under a previous contract to Detachment 12, and it has been determined that the most cost effective solution is the modification of previously delivered Minuteman II stage 3 (M57) MMODS kits delivered under the MMODS contract. The M57 MMODS was procured under a commercial contract with McCormick Selph, and therefore the Air Force did not purchase rights in the proprietary design. For this reason it is not possible to provide the proprietary M57 MMODS kit design for a competitive procurement. Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirements and submit their capabilities as directed below. Responses to this synopsis must be received no later than 15 days after publication.  Respondents must demonstrate how they would produce a MMODS kit capable of destructing a MM III Stage 3 (SR73) motor, which can interface with Minuteman II stage 2 (SR19) motors, without having access to the proprietary design of the commercial MMODS kits. Submissions not meeting the above requirements will not be considered. A Statement of Capabilities (SOC) shall be submitted to this office addressing the above requirements.  The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the above requirement and the following areas:  (1) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort relevant to the specific task areas of this effort.  (2) Personnel: name, professional qualifications, and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in areas of the subject effort.  The SOC must be submitted within 15 calendar days of this publication, and is limited to 25 pages excluding resumes.  Submit only unclassified information.  All shall include company size status under the NAICS code identified below.  Submit all responses to this synopsis to SMC Det 12/PKS, Attn: Mr. Kenneth West, 3550 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5776.  If you are interested only in subcontracting possibilities, please indicate this clearly in your submission.  The contract is anticipated to be a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, an 8(a) firm, a historically black college, or university or a minority institution.  The government reserves the right to set this acquisition, or portions thereof, aside for small businesses, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  For this proposed acquisition, the definitions in FAR 19.001 apply.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 336414.  The industry size standard, which is published by the Small Business Administration and available via the Internet at http://www.sba.gov/size/NAICS-cover-page.htm is 1000 employees.  Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or project manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. The research and test data produced under a resultant contract may contain Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL) information whose export is restricted by the Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S. Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401, et sea.).

Interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  Submissions may be released to non-government advisors for review and analysis.  If the submitter objects to disclosure to non-government advisors, this should be clearly indicated in the submission; otherwise the government will consider all submitted responses to be releasable to non-government advisors.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Dr. David Ganger at (310) 363-0588.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Office of Acquisition Management will issue a solicitation for the manufacture of armored vehicles.  These armored vehicles will be worldwide for protection of American officials.  A portion of the solicitation is classified as Secret.  All offerors will have a pre-solicitation site visit and will be evaluated by the attached site survey by a government official.  The manufacturing will be accomplished at the contractors’ facilities and shipped to the Department of State Facilities located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.   It is anticipated the contract will have a 12 month base year with 4 one-year options.  The government contemplates an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for this requirement.  Future acquisitions will be full and open competition with firms who have clearance or who are able to obtain clearances prior to the release of the solicitation.  The Government will issue a synopsis well in advance of the solicitation release so firms that may not possess the required clearances are given the opportunity to obtain a clearance.  However, due to the time and cost associated with the clearance process, the Department will only sponsor those firms for clearance that it believes have the necessary technical capabilities to furnish these vehicles.  The clearance process as well as the necessary technical capabilities will be included in the synopsis so that all firms are aware of the Government’s requirements.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the
United States Army plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system at the Soldier Systems Center (SSC), Natick, Massachusetts. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. The utility system being privatized is described as follows: Installation: U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (SSC), Natick, Massachusetts is a compact military installation situated on approximately 78 acres located on the eastern shore of Lake Cochituate, approximately 17 miles west of Boston, adjacent to the town of Natick, Massachusetts. SSC provides support to various DoD organizations conducting research, development and testing activities to assure acceptable equipment and technologies for U. S. Army personnel.  SSC’s physical plant at the Main Installation includes roughly 100 buildings and/or structures including a Headquarters Building, Climatic Research and Testing Laboratories, barracks, and various technological support facilities. In total, the physical plant located within the Main Installation covers approximately 786,216 building square footage (SF). The electrical distribution service is provided to approximately 40 buildings covering an estimated 782,000 SF (roughly 99.5 percent of total building square footage).

Electrical Distribution System:  It is the intent of the Army to have the current system to be privatized replaced within 24 months of contract award.  The current electrical system to be replaced includes a 13.8 kV electrical distribution system consisting of approximately 5,242 linear feet (1.0 circuit miles) of overhead distribution line and 17,130 linear feet (3.2 circuit miles) of underground distribution line; One 13.8 kV distribution substation (Station 328); 27 pad-mounted type transformers; 2 oil-filled switches, 27 electrical services and a 1350KVAR power factor correction unit.  The Army receives electrical power from the NSTAR Electric Company.  NSTAR owns, operates and maintains two incoming 13.8 kV feeders and breakers and one metering-equipment cubicle in the substation; the Army owns, operates and maintains the other six (6) cubicles consisting of four breakers, HV fusing and one spare cubicle. SSC and NSTAR jointly own, operate and maintain the testing cubicle.

Mandatory Electrical Distribution System Improvement Requirement:  It is important to note that within 24 months of contract award, the successful offeror is responsible for replacing the entire electrical distribution system with an entirely new underground electrical distribution system.  The design and plan for phased construction of the electrical distribution system shall be subject to SSC’s review and coordination.  Design and construction shall be consistent with national and local electrical distribution utility standards. The new electrical distribution system must be able to feed all buildings located within the Installation boundaries from an alternate feeder in the event a fault occurs along any section of the high voltage (13.8kV) distribution system. This redundancy requirement can be met through various “looped” or “dual feed” system configurations, SSC is interested in the most cost effective means to meet the redundancy requirement.  All existing overhead distribution shall be removed, and replaced with a new underground distribution system all existing underground electrical power cables shall also be replaced with new power cables and duct banks. The successful offeror will also be responsible for coordinating the relocation of the non-power aerial cables (telecommunications, fire, security, etc) currently co-located on utility poles, from overhead to underground. The design and construction of the duct system will be of sufficient capacity to accommodate the relocated non-power cables. Upon completion, all existing aerial cabling and structures shall be completely removed. During construction, the existing system shall remain fully operational until “cut-over” to the new system is made based on a construction schedule reviewed, coordinated, and approved by the SSC.  

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation. Offerors from small businesses will be considered first. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for award to a small business concern are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns. Interested sources shall contact Megan Oz at 703-767-9411 to be added to our bidder mailing list. A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL. The solicitation will be available on or after March 4, 2004. LINKURL: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246 LINKDESC: http://www.desc.dla.mil EMAILADD: Megan.Oz@dla.mil .

<DESC>************ PLEASE NOTE: - This is a very brief description of our objective in pursuing the use of a Broad Agency Announcement. See the detailed information in SWC BAA 04-01 posted 20 Feb 2004 representing the interests of the SWC and its organizations.  The SWC may contract for activities covered in the Focus Areas detailed within this BAA. The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the SWC to meet current and future AF warfighter space needs. The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for AF warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner. White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities or leveraging off existing capabilities.   Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.  After market research was performed, it was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  However, should potential white papers be accepted from those firms, and adequate funding becomes available, proposals will be requested from those institutions.  Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at 719-567-0913 or 719 567-3565 or TSgt Crawford Brown at 719-567-9338.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The VAROC-35, an air dynamometer for the 3500 HP class of aircraft engines in the 24,000-RPM range, will be studied for potential mo difications that will allow for test and evaluation of the 3000 HP engine class family of turbine engines in the 20,000-RPM range.  This investigation shall consider improved alternative air compression designs.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will be a warded to Concepts ETI, Inc., who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement due to ongoing work on the VAROC-35 and VAROC-250, the air dynamometers currently being used in the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Flexibile Engine Diag nostic System.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled, "Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality to Review Clean-Up Documentation (Revised)" which was posted on February 11, 2004.  You are notified that the following changes are made:  Answers to questions received from potential offerors are hereby provided: 		 ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 1.  QUESTION:  In reviewing the referenced project information, it is unclear whether there is an opportunity for engineering firms to submit qualifications.	Is this project going to be handled solely by MDEQ with no outside assistance from other firms.  Any additional information will be appreciated.	 ANSWER:  This project is a sole source procurement with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  The task for MDEQ is to review all documents and the progression of the clean-up project. 2.  QUESTION:	The presolicitation notice appears to be stating that NASA will be purchasing state regulators (MDEQ) services to review responses issued by the very same state regulators.  This appears to be an inherent conflict of interest.	 Is NASA requesting assistance in the area of Professional Administrative and Management Support from contractors with responses from MDEQ regarding the 40 various sites at Stennis?	     ANSWER:  See Answer 1 Above.  At this point there are only nine (9) sites that the MDEQ are looking at.  There have been Public herings on the remediation strategies that are now ongoing.  NASA and it's consultant prresented the strategies to MDEQ and the EPA. Their review was strictly to ensure regulatory compliance, which afforded the agency an opportunity to move at a faster pace without any surprises. 3.   QUESTION:  If NASA intends to request the services from contractors in responding to MDEQ inquiries, please expand on the type of services that will be required. Several references were made under the NASA portion of the MOA indicating that sampling and analysis will be required.  Please clarify the type of services that will be performed on SSC behalf.	    ANSWER: Since the remediation work has been implemented, MDEQ is actually reviewing the information coming out of the pipe now because NASA wants to be open and let the regulators know what the systems are actually doing. So, we are providing funding as a proactive step to get the MDEQ to review our documents and program in an expeditious manner.  4.   QUESTION:  Please clarify this statement, "The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12". What item is being purchased?	    ANSWER: The word "item" is synomous with "service." 5.   QUESTION: Please indicate that type of response, format and length that NASA is requesting under the presolicitation notice.      ANSWER:  NASA is requesting no particular format or length in response to potential offerors providing their Qualifications and Capabilities Statement. The due date for responses is not extended.

<DESC>N65540-04-Q-0013 Amendment 0002 1.   Paragraph C.2.A.5. Attendance Fee of the Statement of Work is hereby replaced with the following: Attendance Fee - The Contractor is entitled to an Attendance Fee as set forth in the Schedule of Commercial Services and Prices located in this contract. The attendance fee shall be payable if the court reporter is required to remain on site for more than one hour.  As noted below if the proceeding is canceled after 5:00pm of the previous day or during the first hour on site, the contractor shall be paid a cancellation fee only.  If the proceeding is canceled after one hour, the contractor shall be entitled to a cancellation fee and an attendance fee. 2.	The following sentence is hereby added to the end of paragraph C.1 SCOPE OF WORK of the Statement of Work as follows: Services may also be required to support hearings in Baltimore MD. and P hiladelphia, PA.  Other hearings may also occur near the other locations provided above depending upon where the presiding judge is located. 3.  Responses to contractor questions a.	Is there any historical data on the number of proceedings per year and the locations? Government Response:  In calendar year 2003, there were approximately 6 days of depositions in Bethesda, 3 days of hearings in Baltimore and 2 hearings that were conducted telephonically.  For Philadelphia there were 3 days of hearings in Philadelphia.  Offerors should be advised however, that the workload is increasing.  In calendar year 2004 so far we have had one telephonic hearing out of Bethesda, 2 days of depositions in Philadelphia and there are two cases that are expected to go a hearing in Philadelphia and the potential for an additional 10-15 days of depositions and hearings in Bethesda.  b.	For C.1 , is there a maximum number of concurrent proceedings for any one day?  For C.1 and L-1(2)3, there is no reporter certification in most states, including the State of Maryland and Pennsylvania.  However, reporters are required to be notaries of their state in order to swear in witnesses. Government Response: The maximum number of concurrent proceedings for any one day is unknown, however, it is unlikely that it would be more than 2 proceedings in one day.  As noted in Section C.2.A.10, court reporters must be able to swear in witnesses and provide the statement as indicated.  Court reporters must be in compliance with whatever training or certification requirements exist within the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is taking place. c.	The attendance fee is bid as a fixed fee, but C.2 A 5 says to charge in 15 minute increments with a 3 hour minimum.  Please clarify this con tradiction. Government Response: The SOW is amended above.

EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS 4.0	52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items  (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award  a contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The factors listed in section 4.0 below will be used to evaluate the offer.  The evaluation factors are listed in order  of importance. (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of  options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by  either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  5.0	Basis for Award This procurement is being solicited,  offered, evaluated, and awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 12, Acquisiton of Commerical Items. The EPA will award a contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible hotel (FAR Subpart 9.104) whose quote, conforming to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the EPA,  price and other factors considered.   The EPA will use the following factors, listed in descending order of importance, to evaluate quotes: ?  Acceptability ?  Suitability   ?  Past Performance ?  Price ?  Green Procurement 6.0  The following methodology will be used to evaluate quotes.   ?   First, the EPA will determine if a quote is acceptable.  If a quote is not acceptable, it may be dropped from consideration and the other evaluation factors not considered.   ?  Second, the EPA will evaluate suitability and past performance of hotels submitting acceptable quotes.   ?  Third, the  EPA will evaluate the price of all hotels who submit acceptable quotes.  ?  Fourth, the EPA will conduct on-site visits to the top three (3) hotels that were selected based on acceptability of the quote, suitability, past performance, and price combined. ?  Fifth,  the EPA will evaluate the  use of the green "environmentally friendly" products in the hotels submitting acceptable quotes.     7.0  	Evaluation Factors 1. Acceptability.  To be considered for award, a vendor must agree to, and conform with, all the terms and conditions of the RFQ.  If a quote is not initially acceptable,  it may be dropped from consideration, and the other evaluation factors not evaluated. Acceptability will be scored on a "pass/fail" basis. 2a.  Suitability.  Suitability encompasses all factors that contribute to the conference attendee's comfort and safety and to the overall success of the  conference held at the hotel.  Evaluation of suitability will be a subjective assessment of the features offered by the hotel.   The suitability assessment will focus on, but not be limited to:  (1) Meeting Rooms and Function Space Availability: meeting rooms and function space availability during  July; can accommodate each meeting room and function space requirement;  (2) Lodging Availability: can provide sleeping rooms at the current Federal lodging rate; can provide sleeping rooms three (3) days prior to and three (3) days after the core Conference meeting days; can provide the minimum  room block;  (3) Location Accessibility: average daytime and nighttime temperatures in July;  and average precipitation in July;  (4) Facility Features:  number of total sleeping rooms and guest floors; proximity of facility to nearest major airport (e.g., miles one-way); ground transportation  availability, cost, and hours of operation; FEMA certification; ADA compliance; VIP treatment and amenities; guest room and occupancy tax prices and tax exempt policy; and complimentary guest room policy. (5) Meeting Room Features:  Available square footage; flexibility of making on-site changes to  room assignments and set-ups, including fees, if any; complimentary meeting room policy; complimentary meeting room amenities and equipment; storage space policy and price; receiving of conference materials (policy and price).  (6) Audiovisual Equipment and Labor:  Completed chart in the attached  CLIN template; provided total sum rental price for the audiovisual equipment rental and labor charges; and policy and surcharges, if any for use of an outside audiovisual equipment vendor.  (7) Business Center Services Charges:  Completed chart in the attached CLIN template; provide total sum of  services.   The EPA will base its rating of these features solely on the information provided in each quote.  Suitability is an adjectival (Superior [of great value or excellence; extraordinary; better than average], Adequate [sufficient to satisfy a requirement or meet a need], Poor [lacking in a  specified resource or quality]), scored evaluation factor. 2.  Past performance.   Past performance is considered to be the hotel's relevant conferenece related conference related history. Especially relevant are a hotel's record of conforming to contract requirements; a hotel's commitment to  customer satisfaction; and, generally, a hotel's reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers. Past performance is a "pass/fail" evaluation factor. 3.  Price.  Price is the total evaluated price.  EPA will base total evaluated price on the prices quoted  for all CLINs listed in Part I.  The total evaluated price will be based on the "estimated maximum" quantities shown for each CLIN multiplied by the unit prices quoted. Price is not a scored evaluation factor.  EPA will use total evaluated cost as part of its best value analysis. 4.  On-Site  Visit.  The on-site visit will occur once the top three (3) hotels are selected from all the offers.  Once the top three (3) hotels are selected, they will receive notification from EPA of their selection.  The COTR/Designee will contact the top three (3) hotels to schedule the on-site visits.  The  on-site visits will be evaluated according to the (1) Facility:  physical, appearance, cleanliness, ventilation, and general lighting features of the hotel; ADA implementation; number and location of guest elevators; availability of recycling by conferees of office paper, aluminum cans, and drink  bottles during the Conference; types and dates of last previous and future renovations; technology features and capabilities (complimentary and fee-based); proximity to nearest hospital, police station and fire department; smoking policy in public areas; gratuity or service charges; business  service availability and price; employee and city services unions' existence and contract expiration dates; on-site parking availability and price; availability of public transportation between the hotel and the airport; accessibility to airport; characteristics of the neighborhood in which the  hotel is located; types of and proximity to on-site and off-site services and amenities; and proximity to off-site food establishments and their convenience, cost, and hours of operation.  (2) Meeting Rooms and Function Space:  number of elevators and escalators to meeting room and function space;  proximity to and number of restrooms; proximity to and number of public telephones; overall condition, appearance, ventilation, and lighting; room size, dimension, and shape; obstructions (such as pillars); temperature control capabilities and location; lighting and light controls; ADA  implementation; accessibility to rooms; appropriateness for PO/CO National Conference; size of foyer areas and mingling space; level of and type of soundproofing; proximity of rooms to each other; proximity to potential distractions; and proximity to kitchen.

On-Site Visit is an adjectival (Superior [of great value or excellence; extraordinary; better than average], Adequate [sufficient to satisfy a  requirement or meet a need], Poor [lacking in a specified resource or quality]), scored evaluation factor. 5.   Green Procurement.  EPA will base its rating on the facility that provides "Environmentally Freindly", a green facility, such as the use of biobased products, use of  recovered  materials, reuse of products, recyclability , and life cycle cost.  Green Procurement is a "pass/fail" evaluation factor. www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/pmrcsc/kanehotel/index.htm

<DESC>The Human Systems Program Office, 311 HSW/YA, intends to issue a solicitation for a   Chemical/Biological (CB) Liner for Large Capacity Shelter (LCS).  This acquisition will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside; the NAICS code is 325211, and the size standard is 750.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the design, development and delivery of Chemical/Biological (CB)liners first articles to be used with the latest Air Force Medium Shelter system (MSS) currently in inventory. This project will be called the “Large Capacity Shelter CB Liner (LCS CB Liner).”  It will be a 5-layer Saranex laminate CB liner, that will be used in conjunction with other CB components in inventory to provide a collective protection (CP) system that is needed in bare base, medical, and special operations deployments worldwide. A prototype “non-CB” liner made of lightweight polyester was developed and installed into a MSS. This anticipated award will require the contractor to develop first article, conduct first article tests according to government specifications, and deliver successful first article, test data, Level III Drawings and performance specification.  Based upon the availability of funds, the government will compete production of the LCS CB liner at a later date. 
REQUIREMENT: The LCS CB Liner will interface with the standard M28 CPE Type II vestibule membrane opening and be compatible with existing CP liner closures adopted in the Air Force Medical Shelter System (AF Small Shelter) shelters. Approximate dimensions for each liner are: 29 ½ feet wide by 26 feet long with a height of 10 feet. Each MSS will use 2 liners that will connect to each other to create approximate a 1,500 sq ft toxic free area. A purchase description and Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be accessible via FedBizOpps.gov using solicitation number FA8902-04-R-1000.  It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal will be released on or about 1 December 2003 and will remain open for 45 days after issuance.

<CONTACT>Marjorie Roberts, 410-436-6797
<DESC>See BAA at this web site: https://dtsn.darpa.mil/TACTIC With this announcement, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Special Projects Office (SPO), is providing advance notice of a new Research and Development (R&D) program, Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC); Pr ogram Manager: Dr. Wayne Bryden, wbryden@darpa.mil.  In support of the TACTIC Program, DARPA plans to release two Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) simultaneously:  BAA04-TDT (TACTIC-DT, Detection Technologies) and BAA04-TCM (TACTIC-CM, Countermeasure).  T hese efforts will represent the first phase of the TACTIC Program. The TACTIC Program focuses on interception and defeat of chemical and biological threat agent aerosol/vapor clouds on the battlefield that can be produced during military operations either by defensive measures against an adversary or by intentional agent dissemination/release by an adversary.  Release of such agents could cause widespread disruption of military operations.  The TACTIC Program seeks to actively protect troops and military assets from such events and to provide a means to maintain critical m ilitary operations at the required tempo by pursuing two paths in parallel:  1) development of technologies that can rapidly detect, discriminate and identify chemical and biological airborne clouds with low false-alarm rates, and 2) development of technol ogies that can defeat (precipitate and/or neutralize) the clouds before they can reach the troops on the battlefield.   The actions outlined in this Notice are intended solely to enable potential sources to gain an understanding of the TACTIC Program prior to the release of the associated BAAs.  It is DARPAs intention to release the BAAs, which will be posted on the Federal  Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, approximately two weeks after this Pre-Solicitation Notice is released.  Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the release of the BAAs. A Pre-Proposal Conference (Bidders Brief) will be held approximately three weeks after the FedBizOpps BAA releases.  The conference will be held in Arlington, Virginia, at ANSER Analytic Services, Inc.  The morning session will be dedicated to discussions of TACTIC-DT and the afternoon session will be dedicated to TACTIC-CM.  Attendance at this meeting is voluntary and limited to organizations that can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of having expertise that might contribute to the success of the TACTI C Program.  However, attendance is not required in order to be deemed eligible to propose on this program.  Instructions for registration, along with all TACTIC Program information will be provided at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/TACTIC following release of the BAAs.  Registration will close 3 days prior to the conference. The DARPA TACTIC Program Manager will be available for meetings, telephone conferences, or video telephone conferences to discuss technical approaches from Proposers, during a two week period following the Pre-Proposal Conference.  These can be scheduled b y contacting BAA04-TDT@darpa.mil or BAA04-TCM@darpa.mil. The anticipated scope of work to be covered under the TACTIC Program includes:  development of the detection or countermeasure technology to the specifications outlined in the Proposer Information Pamphlets (PIP) for each respective BAA; a (mathematical) m odel that predicts the probability of detection (PD) and probability of false alarm (PFA) (for the detection technology), and a model that predicts the performance of the countermeasure (e.g., log reduction in live agent); experiments conducted at Performe r laboratories and testbeds; experimental results coupled to modeling to predict performance of the technologies, and; testing conducted at a Government aerosol testing laboratory.   If testing at the Government facility is deemed successful, the Government will initiate a new Phase, to integrate Detection Technologies and Countermeasures into  an operational system.  This Phase will include a new competition for Performers.   The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with the Pre-Proposal Conference discussed in this announcement.   Questions of a technical nature should be sent to BAA04-TDT@darpa.mil or BAA04-TCM@darpa.mil.  Questions of a contractua l nature should be addressed to:  Ms. Marjorie Roberts, Contract Specialist, (410)436-6797, marjorie.roberts@us.army.mil.  Contracting OfficerÃ¢Â€Â™s Representative (COR), Mr. Peter Annunziato, peter.annunziato@us.army.mil. BAA04-TDT and BAA04-TCM will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS under Other Defense Agencies, DARPA.

<DESC>The National Park Service issued a notice of availability of a prospectus for solicitation of proposals for marina facilities and services at the Whiskeytown Unit of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area.  The solicitation period was scheduled to be November 18, 2003 - March 3, 2004.  	The solicitation period has been extended to April 6, 2004 to provide adequate time for potential offerors to incorporate information provided by the National Park Service.  In order for the National Park Service to evaluate the offeror's response to Principal Selection Factor 4 located in the Proposal Package at page 15, the offeror's estimate of the investments and startup costs of the business should be included on the forms at the end of Subfactor B4(a).  All offerors must include their estimates of the value of all property intended for use in the concession contract and explain fully the methodology and the assumptions used to develop the estimates.  Estimates that are not fully explained may result in a reduced score for Principal Selection Factor 4.  Offerors should identify any property management or appraisal certifications held, if any, by the offeror or by a third party employed in developing such estimates of value and list the individual's experience and skills.  The information provided should be of sufficient detail to allow a reviewer to fully understand and determine the soundness of the estimates.

DCHA/OFDA Program Officers are primary points of contact for DCHA/OFDA in the field in specific countries.

<SUBJECT>A--COMMON UNDERSEA PICTURE (CUP) INTEGRATION SOURCES SOUGHT
<SOLNBR>N00024xxxxxxX
<CONTACT>Steve Williams 202-781-3962
<DESC>Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems, Project Manager for Surface Ship Undersea Warfare Combat Systems (PEO  IWS5B) is seeking sources for the software integration, validation, tracking, installation support, and configuration management of Common Undersea Picture (CUP) as part of an Evolutionary Development strategy (Builds 1,2 and 3) for all Navy Undersea Warfare (USW) Platforms and Shore sites. Common Undersea Picture (CUP) provides the Undersea Warfare (USW), Command and Control (C2) decision support system component evolving to the Joint C2 toolset, Common Operational Picture (COP).  CUP is a FY04 program start delivering an integrated, near-real time, net-centric USW command and control capability across multiple platforms.  Build 0 is currently being installed on both surface and submarine war-fighting assets of the Stennis Battle Group, as well as sever al shore sites, for capabilities demonstration during RIMPAC 04.   CUP Build 0 is a software toolset resident in state of the art COTS electronics that are mounted in a Grade-B shock rated hardware rack.  The software toolset consists of several Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs) utilized in USW such as PC-IMAT, MPS, ORP and MEDAL integrated together and sharing a common Operator Machine Interface (OMI).  The COTS hardware provides a) significant processing power via STAPLE, b) three operating environments, Windows 2K, and Sun SOLARIS with the Common Operating Environment COE4.7 (used by the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and Global Command and Control Systems Maritime (GCCS-M)), as well as LINUX, and  c) UDEM utilized for data and band-width management at the interface to the Ship-board LAN and SIPRNET. Utilizing an Evolutionary Development process, with successive  Build-Test-Build cycles CUP Builds 1, 2 and 3 will migrate to a software only solution running as an application on the GCCS-M backbone, providing increased functional capability with common hardware.  Each successive Build of CUP will provide improved situational awareness; mission planning, and collaboration in support of mission execution, as well as improved environmental understanding and performance prediction capabilities. The CUP integrator will be responsible for: integration of third-party applications from technology developers (both government, academia, and industry); software configuration management, PTR tracking and software fixes; testing of the integrated software product; procurement, assembly, testing, shipment and installation support for CUP-specific hardware; member of the Government lead CUP System Engineering Team, ILS development, and certificatio ns (including network and security); development of the CUP Builds as compatible with COE 4.x and portable as a GCCS-M 4.x application. The three successive Build cycles (Builds 1, 2, and 3) will each be approximately two years in duration, starting in FY04.  CUP plans to install capability on all USW surface and submarine war-fighter assets of two Carrier Strike Groups (CSG) or Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESG) as well as Shore sites each year FY05-09.  Once CUP is installed on platforms and at shore sites, technology will be periodically refreshed in conjunction with delivery of follow-on CUP Builds or software upgrades.  The period of performance is expected to be 60 months.  Points of Contact: CDR. Charles A. Davis, CUP Project Lead, (202) 781-2567, e-mail: DavisCA@navsea.navy.mil; Bernard Strozeski, CUP Acquisition Deputy, (202) 781-4378, e-mail: StrozeskiBB@nav sea.navy.mil; LCDR.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Joint Decontamination Effort for Decontamination Solution/Devices

The Air Force 311th Human Systems Wing is seeking information from sources that are capable of providing mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.  “Mature,” is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Seven or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.  TRL-7 means that a system prototype demonstration has occurred in an operational environment and that the prototype is near or at a planned operational system level.  Your device/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation.  Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.    The purpose of this document is to identify potential sources. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded.  

The Joint Program Manager for Decontamination is examining all current decontaminants and devices to determine what interim solutions for decontamination of equipment, aircraft, and large areas are immediately available.

Government field trials are scheduled at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT, for a few weeks in the April 2004 to June 2004 time period.  For some decontamination systems and solutions, technical testing may occur elsewhere.  These field trials will provide the government an opportunity to demonstrate the devices'/technologies' potential for inclusion into future CB defense programs, and obtain unique performance data that can be used in their developmental work.  

Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on large pieces of equipment, vehicles, aircraft or terrain. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or “slip ins” are acceptable).  Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: (1) Provide data that demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.  Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign. (2) Provide data that demonstrates a decontamination efficacy to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc. (3) Supply information on material compatibility. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided.  (4) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's) on all products. (5) Provide evidence of production capability/capacity. (6) Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options. (7) Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing. (8) Be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) clothing and does not present a hazard to equipment or personnel while being operated in MOPP. (9) Provide the results of developing and operational testing using their product in the decontamination of large pieces of equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, or terrain.  (10) Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment, vehicle, and terrain.  NOTE:  Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated surety, material compatibility, pot life, shelf life, etc., data.

For submissions to be considered as decontamination systems, developers/sponsors must electronically supply (.doc or .pdf format) the preceding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Leo Gomez, leo.gomez@brooks.af.mil, no later than 1700, March 5, 2004.  Telephonic responses will not be accepted.  Electronic Media can be mailed to 311 HSW/YACR, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks City-Base TX 78235-5119, ATTN: Mr. Leo Gomez. Technical questions should be directed to Dr. John Wiemaster at jfweimas@apgea.army.mil

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.  Submittals will not be returned to the sender.  Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. 

The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.

<DESC>This is a request for information only - no contract will result from responses received for this RFI.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Office of Force Transformation (OFT) is assessing the capabilities of the defense industry as it rela tes to the transformation of the military to meet the future threat environment, specifically the application of non-lethal directed energy. Purpose:  As part of its ongoing assessment, the Office of Force Transformation (OFT) Project SHERIFF is seeking possible applications of millimeter wave-range directed energy systems to enhance non-lethal weapon technologies, to include systems capable of  enabling apprehension of individual at significantly greater distances than currently possible with other non-lethal devices (tasers, projected nets, etc.). In particular, OFT is seeking range-of-magnitude cost information on portable and crew-served weap on sized formats for these technologies, as well any vehicle-mounted or large scale fixed site systems.  This is a request for information only - no contract will result from responses received for this RFI.  However, the OFT may issue a formal Request for  Proposal (RFP)/Request for Quote (RFQ), or other appropriate instrument, at some future time in order to implement specific solutions. Background:  Project 'SHERIFF' is an OFT initiative to develop and rapidly field a series of operational prototypes integrating directed energy and kinetic systems, both lethal and non-lethal; active protection/Ã¢Â€Âactive defenseÃ¢Â€Â technology; and a variety of advanced sensors, all mounted on armored vehicles in order to provide a fundamentally new set of tactical capabilities for land combat.   It is intended to provide not only mobile, protected, and Ã¢Â€ÂœtunableÃ¢Â€Â, precision effects and scalab le lethality, but also engagement sequences that are faster than current systems by an order of magnitude, making it a potentially paradigm-breaking capability package for urban operations as well as other combined arms warfare scenarios within both major combat operations and stability operations.  In the near term, a key focus will be to explore millimeter-wave technologies as a potential counter to the operational challenges of close-range urban area RPG and IED ambushes.  Ultimately, however,  SHERIFF i s intended to advance a prototype of combined physical and psychological  effects , as opposed to simply Ã¢Â€Âœcombined armsÃ¢Â€Â, on the tactical battlefield.  It must be stressed that SHERIFF is not intended to be solely focused on any one narrow range of scenarios. Responses that contain proprietary information should be clearly marked to ensure correct handling.  The information provided may be used to refine the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s focus in formulating its approach for addressing its needs in this area.  The governme nt will not respond individually to the submissions except to request additional information if appropriate.  Responses can be sent electronically or by post, but should not exceed 10 pages total.  Do not respond to this RFI after 6 March 2004. Vendor and product information should be sent to  The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of Force Transformation, Attn: Col G. P. Garrett, USMC, 1401 Wilson Blvd #301, Arlington, VA 22209-2306. Col GarrettÃ¢Â€Â™s e-mail address is: pat.garrett@osd.mil  No telephone calls will be accepted.

C.6		Project Description and Profile

Power infrastructure is critical to modern economic activity; yet only 55 percent of households in India have access to electricity.  Most of those with access do not get uninterrupted reliable supply.  The power industry has among the highest tariffs in the world, but power cuts, erratic voltage and low or high supply frequencies are common problems.  These problems often emanate from inadequate power generation capacity; lack of optimum utilization of the existing generation capacity; inadequate and aging sub-transmission & distribution networks, and high levels of distribution losses, theft, and uncollected bills.

In order to attain the ambitious goal stated by the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers to provide electricity to all villages by 2007 and to all households by 2012, finding solutions to these stifling power problems is a priority.  In a landmark step forward, the GOI enacted the Electricity Act 2003 – a comprehensive piece of legislation to bring about a qualitative transformation of the electricity sector.  The Electricity Act 2003 provides for increased competition in the sector by allowing private sector participation, open access to power transmission and distribution, de-licensing of generation, power trading and setting up of captive power plants without any restriction.  The individual States are required to align their laws with this new national Act, effectively making this uniform across the country. 

One of the key results of the reform is to provide adequate power under commercially oriented principles.  The new allowance of direct links between generation and distribution of electricity to creditworthy consumers helps developers mitigate risks and makes private development a more viable option.  Private sector involvement is also helped by the commitments to reduce distribution loss and power theft, as well as formulate tariffs without subsidies and based on effective usage monitoring.  These reforms have created a number of opportunities in power generation, transmission and distribution.  

Private power providers in the major cities of New Delhi and Mumbai have highlighted their upcoming investments and stated areas for USTDA assistance.  The New Delhi Power and Light Co. (NDPL), having recently privatized 51 percent of their power distribution to Tata Industries, has made automating its distribution and reducing losses key priorities.  They anticipate investments between $70-80 million to improve power quality, reliability, use of GIS technology and automation.  In Mumbai, BSES is India’s largest private sector power firm.   BSES recently negotiated increased ownership by Reliance Industries and committed to the shared goal of providing uninterrupted quality power to consumers in a cost-efficient manner; creating new assets on an international scale; employing state-of-the art technologies for operational efficiencies; and reaching a wider customer base.  BSES also has potential generation and distribution projects in the State of Orissa.   These and other projects will be evaluated during this DM.
