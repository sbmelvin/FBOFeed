<SUBJECT>A -- Broad Agency Announcement for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies for Reducing Various Environmental Problems
<SOLNBR>AFCEEBAA-08-001
<CONTACT>MaryJo Boldt, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-4505, Email maryjo.boldt@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Restoration Branch, Technology Transfer Office (TDV) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open for one year and will be advertised annually. This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Air Force (AF) operations and apply to Air Force installations worldwide.  The key focus of this effort is to further develop demonstration/field-tested remediation, contaminated site characterization and monitoring, and pollution prevention technologies and methodologies that serve as an innovative means to save money and time while achieving compliance with all air, soil, and water regulatory requirements and Air Force policies and technical guidance.  The goal is to identify more technically advanced, efficient, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions than are currently available.  Such technologies and methodologies should aid the US Air Force in reaching the remedy-in-place (RIP) goal of 2012 or optimizing current remediation or monitoring systems already in place.  The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&D) phase.  The remedial technologies areas of interest include, but are not limited to, effective dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) characterization, monitoring, fate and transport, detection, and remediation; improve/optimize remediation and long-term monitoring (LTM) technologies; assessment and mitigation of hazards associated with vapor intrusion; remedial techniques and methods to more effectively treat soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents; implementation of rapid site characterization through definitive field-based analytical methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi VOCs, and other common contaminants.  Additional areas of interest include innovative pollution prevention techniques, innovative site characterization approaches and tools, new and innovative quality assurance methodologies, and innovative monitoring and optimization systems for existing remediation operations (e.g., pump-and-treat) including sensors and data management systems.
Proposal submittal is a two-phase process.  Phase I Offerors submit proposals by completing a short questionnaire on the AFCEE BAA web page developed specifically to facilitate proposal submittal in the BAA program. The requested information includes:  description of the technology (synonymous with methodology, as applicable) being proposed and a discussion of the technical benefits to include the type of site and specific problem addressed; contamination and media treated; description of how project supports the Remedy-in-Place (RIP)/Response Complete (RC) Goal of 2012; qualifications of the offeror; estimated cost range of the demonstration/field testing of the technology; and approximated time to complete the proposed effort.  Limits to the length of each section are noted in the web-based proposal form.   PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 29 APRIL 2008.  Phase I submittals received after 29 April 2008, may or may not be evaluated.  However, these proposals will be held for possible action until expiration of this BAA. The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the same selection criteria used to evaluate Phase II proposals. It is critical that the offeror convey the above information accurately and concisely so that proposal evaluators can judge the merits of the proposed demonstration/field testing of the technology. Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II.  Offerors whose proposals are not selected for Phase II are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link.  To be eligible for award submission of Phase I is required. 

	Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information:  Technology or methodology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration/field testing, pilot-scale or treatability studies. The technology or methodology must be described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application. The proposal shall include the types of contaminants treated, the media (i.e., soil, groundwater) treated, and any limitations known to affect the application of the technology or methodology.  Benefits to the USAF of using the proposed technology or methodology. This should include a comparison with existing technologies or methodologies used to treat the same contaminants, and how the proposed technology or methodology improves cleanup over existing technology or methodology and/or lowers the cost of environmental restoration/prevention.  The objectives of the proposed technology or methodology demonstration/field testing, the tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration/field testing, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for the demonstration/field test.  The qualifications of the offeror to successfully perform the technology or methodology demonstration/field test.
	
	Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Phase II proposals shall be submitted as attachments to an electronic submittal form that is accessed via the notification from AFCEE.  The technical proposal shall be limited to 10 pages, typed at 10 pitch or larger type, single spaced, and single sided, on sheets 8.5 X 11 with 1 margins.  This page limitation is inclusive of indexes, photographs, fold-outs, appendices, and attachments.  Pages in excess of this limitation will not be evaluated by Government evaluators. Suggested inclusion within the 10 page limitation are: (1) four pages describing the proposed technology or methodology, (2) one page containing a SOW, (3) one page discussing the capability of the offeror, references and point of contact for the demonstration/field test, (4) three pages describing proposed schedule for demonstration/field test, past experience and performance, and other places the technology or methodology has been demonstrated, and (5) one page list of key personnel that will perform the demonstration/field test. The cost proposal has no page limitations; however, offerors are requested to use five (5) pages as a goal.  The cost and technical proposals are to be submitted together in Microsoft Word and Excel formats.

Submittals to this BAA Phase I shall be through the following Internet address http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa .  Each electronic form shall address only one technology and one topic. Separate forms shall be submitted for each additional topic or additional technology. Response time for Phase II submittal will be 30 days from electronic notice.  The submittal shall concisely describe the technology and shall be evaluated according to the criteria stated in this announcement. No additional data may be submitted for this BAA. If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other. The TEB will evaluate the submittals to this BAA. Vendor submittals that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program. Once accepted into the program, the proposal will be shared with appropriate DOD personnel for consideration. Vendor submittals having a technology or process applicable to a specific environmental need may be asked to contract for a field application. Final selection for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's Phase II full proposal (both technical and cost) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.
(1)	The technical aspect, which is ranked as first in importance, shall be evaluated based on the following criteria which are of equal importance.  
	New solutions with unique applications to Air Force problems.  
	Organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposed SOW.

<DESC>DME MAC Jurisdiction C Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a DME MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform numerous functions on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and shall establish relationships with suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS), for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor shall perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare FFS program. The Medicare FFS program's legal, policy and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor shall utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment and/or operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor shall coordinate its activities not only with CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from DMEPOS suppliers and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, as well as perform edits on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also conducts a variety of different supplier services, such as answering written inquiries, and educating them on Medicare's rules and regulations and billing procedures. The Contractor also operates Medicare's supplier's toll-free lines across the country to answer a wide-range of supplier questions. Additionally, the Contractor conducts redeterminations on appeals of claims and responds to complex beneficiary inquiries referred from the Beneficiary Contact Centers.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction C (comprised of the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia) on or about November 30, 2010. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is January 11, 2011 with an anticipated award date of August 24, 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis for the upcoming acquisition of a Transportation Management Service (TMS) for the U.S. General Services Administration.
<p>GSA's Center for Transportation Management (QMCC) offers freight and household goods transportation services for federal civilian agencies. GSA is the sole agency mandated to procure and negotiate transportation rates on behalf of all Federal civilian agencies. GSA's solicitation and acceptance of rates and charges provide highly competitive pricing, which in many cases includes the solicitation and acceptance of rates specific to an agency's facility and shipping characteristics. GSA offers several programs to support the transportation needs of the Government.</p>
<p>Freight Management Program (FMP): FMP provides a framework for fulfilling the domestic freight shipping requirements of Federal agencies. GSA's Standard Tender of Service establishes a uniform basis for buying freight transportation through its rules and accessorial services. The program offers rate management services nationally for general commodity freight transportation.</p>
<p>Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP): GSA's Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP) assists relocating Federal Government employees in transporting household goods from one official duty station to another, both domestically and internationally. CHAMP stipulates provisions for transporting household goods, privately owned vehicles, and unaccompanied air baggage.</p>
<p>Currently, the transportation options are accessed through GSA's internet based Transportation Management Services Solution (TMSS).</p>
<p>QMCC's goal is to become the "provider of choice" for all transportation needs across the Federal Government and create a contemporary world-class portfolio program that consistently meets the needs of the Federal community. In order to support this goal, QMCC is acquiring a streamlined, adaptable world-class Transportation Management Service (TMS) that continually applies commercial best practices to realize transportation efficiencies and deliver a transparent, accountable, and sustainable service that yields exceptional customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The overriding objectives for TMS are total cost savings for transportation spending for the Federal Government, industry best practices in transportation procurement, execution and visibility and advanced management reporting offered on a highly scalable platform. TMS will ensure the delivery of user friendly, customer-centric, configurable, policy-compliant, reliable, and secure Federal transportation management service using a contractor-owned, hosted, and operated model, e.g., an Application Service Provider (ASP) or Software as a Service (SaaS). The TMS provider will foster an environment of Government-wide collaboration among all parties to include all Federal agencies, all approved Transportation Service Providers (TSP) and GSA. <br />QMCC seeks to identify &lsquo;one solution' to support all of its needs. Any contract resulting from the Statement of Work (SOW) will provide for a TMS that improves usability, advanced functionality, accessibility, performance, reporting and security.</p>
<p>Full operational capability is expected by January 2012.</p>
<p>The contract type anticipated will be a Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract. The Period of Performance is expected to be for one (1) Base Year Period, with at least four 1-year options to renew. This procurement is not a Set-Aside for Small Business concerns. However, all qualified Small Business concerns are encouraged to submit offers. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541519 and the size standard to be considered a Small Business is $25M in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Offerors must also complete Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Large businesses will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Offers must be in English and U.S. Dollars. Solicitation QMAC-RK-110001-N will issue on/about December 1, 2010 at this website (www.fbo.gov), and will close on/about January 3, 2011. Interested parties may send expressions of interest to include name, point of contact, contact information, email address, company web site address, business size, and a brief capability statement to onthego@gsa.gov, subject: TMS Solicitation QMAC-RK-110001-N no later than November 30, 2010.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis for the upcoming acquisition of a Transportation Management Service (TMS) for the U.S. General Services Administration.
<p>GSA's Center for Transportation Management (QMCC) offers freight and household goods transportation services for federal civilian agencies. GSA is the sole agency mandated to procure and negotiate transportation rates on behalf of all Federal civilian agencies. GSA's solicitation and acceptance of rates and charges provide highly competitive pricing, which in many cases includes the solicitation and acceptance of rates specific to an agency's facility and shipping characteristics. GSA offers several programs to support the transportation needs of the Government.</p>
<p>Freight Management Program (FMP): FMP provides a framework for fulfilling the domestic freight shipping requirements of Federal agencies. GSA's Standard Tender of Service establishes a uniform basis for buying freight transportation through its rules and accessorial services. The program offers rate management services nationally for general commodity freight transportation.</p>
<p>Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP): GSA's Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP) assists relocating Federal Government employees in transporting household goods from one official duty station to another, both domestically and internationally. CHAMP stipulates provisions for transporting household goods, privately owned vehicles, and unaccompanied air baggage.</p>
<p>Currently, the transportation options are accessed through GSA's internet based Transportation Management Services Solution (TMSS).</p>
<p>QMCC's goal is to become the "provider of choice" for all transportation needs across the Federal Government and create a contemporary world-class portfolio program that consistently meets the needs of the Federal community. In order to support this goal, QMCC is acquiring a streamlined, adaptable world-class Transportation Management Service (TMS) that continually applies commercial best practices to realize transportation efficiencies and deliver a transparent, accountable, and sustainable service that yields exceptional customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The overriding objectives for TMS are total cost savings for transportation spending for the Federal Government, industry best practices in transportation procurement, execution and visibility and advanced management reporting offered on a highly scalable platform. TMS will ensure the delivery of user friendly, customer-centric, configurable, policy-compliant, reliable, and secure Federal transportation management service using a contractor-owned, hosted, and operated model, e.g., an Application Service Provider (ASP) or Software as a Service (SaaS). The TMS provider will foster an environment of Government-wide collaboration among all parties to include all Federal agencies, all approved Transportation Service Providers (TSP) and GSA. <br />QMCC seeks to identify &lsquo;one solution' to support all of its needs. Any contract resulting from the Statement of Work (SOW) will provide for a TMS that improves usability, advanced functionality, accessibility, performance, reporting and security.</p>
<p>Full operational capability is expected by January 2012.</p>
<p>The contract type anticipated will be a Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract. The Period of Performance is expected to be for one (1) Base Year Period, with at least four 1-year options to renew. This procurement is not a Set-Aside for Small Business concerns. However, all qualified Small Business concerns are encouraged to submit offers. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541519 and the size standard to be considered a Small Business is $25M in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Offerors must also complete Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Large businesses will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Offers must be in English and U.S. Dollars. Solicitation QMAC-RK-110001-N will issue on/about December 1, 2010 at this website (www.fbo.gov), and will close on/about January 3, 2011. Interested parties may send expressions of interest to include name, point of contact, contact information, email address, company web site address, business size, and a brief capability statement to onthego@gsa.gov, subject: TMS Solicitation QMAC-RK-110001-N no later than November 30, 2010.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) Paragraph 3.2.2.4) (Single Source Selection), the FAA proposes to award a five (5) year single source contract to Astronics/DME, 6830 N.W. 16th Terrace,  Ft Lauderdale, FL 33309 for the FAA approved Voice Switch ByPass (VSBP) equipment.
Astronic/DME is the vendor for the current Voice Switch ByPass (VSBP), contract, DTFAWA-07-00004 which is ending.
The new contract will have a 24-month Base Period, one 24-month Option and one 12-month Option Period, to provide the FAA's Voice Switch & Recording Program Office with VSBP equipment, modules and services for newly constructed and existing facilities (i.e. air traffic control tower and terminal radar approach control (TRACON)) until the next voice switch acquisition program with voice switch bypass equipment and modules is fielded.  
Purpose of Announcement: This announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures and is for informational purposes only.  It's not a Solicitation or Request for Proposal.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.  Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Whitney Coleman-Clark, Contract Specialist, by 12:00 PM EST, November 24, 2010, via email at whitney.coleman-clark@faa.gov.
Pursuant to the FAA's Acquisition Management System Policy Guide, Section 3.2.2.4 Single Source Selection is permitted when "such action is determined to be in the best interest of the FAA and the Rational Basis is documented."  Based upon the rationale within this document, procurement through a single source solicitation fulfills the requirement for rational basis action.  This rationale is based upon coordination urgency, the need for standardization, and the fact that Astronics/DME Corporation is the only source available to satisfy the interim requirements in the required time frame.
A competitive bid approach is estimated to be a 39 month solicitation to contract award process before a new contractor could provide a system that was System Specification compliant, FAA tested and approved system.  This means VSBP equipment systems modules would not be available to meet new FAA facility requirements or to expand legacy VSBP equipment systems until January 2014 (39 months).
The FAA has invested heavily in establishing the infrastructure to support the VSBP equipment system baseline.  A new contract would require the FAA to invest similar funding to create the infrastructure needed to support a new VSBP equipment system baseline.
The VSBP equipment system is the only FAA Air Traffic Control VSBP equipment in production that has completed the FAA's Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), Independent Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) and In-Service Decision (ISD) Review process. The VSBP equipment has approved technical documentation and the FAA infrastructure in place to support air traffic and maintenance (TECHOPS) technical training and support requirements.
The VSBP equipment system supports the FAA safety of flight requirements, the FAA can not delay fielding of VSBP equipment system for 39 months.  Awarding to the incumbent allows the FAA to continue deploying VSBP equipment systems until the NVS contract is awarded.
Awarding a single source contract to the incumbent will save the FAA a significant amount of money over the next five (5) years because the entire life-cycle support, logistics and training infrastructure does not need to be replicated contract.
AMS guidelines indicate a single source is merited when equipment is standardized and fills the FAA's immediate need for equipment of proven capability.  It is concluded that a single source contract with Astronics/DME Corporation represents the lowest risk and lowest cost for the FAA as well as, the overall best value in order to meet the FAA's interim needs until NVS completes the procurement process.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office space in a building under lease in Juneau, Alaska, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 7,300 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related use space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 7,300 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for ten years/five years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 30, 2009.  The building must be located within the following delineated area:

South Boundary: Juneau Airport
North Boundary: Glacier Highway
East Boundary: Jordan
West Boundary: Radcliffe Road

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.

The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety, Seismic Safety and Handicapped Accessibility. 

Please send expressions of interest to the following person and address in writing, via email, or via fax, and provide site address, size and offered square footage, date of space availability, expected rental rate per useable square foot fully-serviced and whether or not the quoted rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.

GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any Federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of GSA or their authorized representative Studley/LaBonde Land, Inc.  Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord but any properties or proposals submitted by broker/agent must be accompanied by written evidence they are authorized to represent the ownership of the building or property.

<p><strong>a.</strong> The EDS detector shall be capable of mapping at an maximum input count rate of greater than 3 million x-ray input counts per second (average output count rate greater than 1 million counts per second) with an energy resolution less than or equal to 170 eV to enable high throughput hyperspectral x-ray mapping. Also, the energy resolution at lower count rates (up to 400,000 input counts per second) shall be better than or equal to 133 eV measured for the Mn Ka line. Lastly, the EDS detector shall use electronic cooling methods (such as Peltier cooling) to eliminate the need for liquid nitrogen cooling and minimize vibrations to the scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> The EDS system software shall allow for collection of hyperspectral chemical data from a scanning electron microscope in point, line, and mapping modes, including fast hyperspectral mapping modes (up to 1024 x 1024 pixel maps with pixel dwell times at or above 1 microsecond) for collecting hyperspectral data. Drift correction software shall be supplied to reduce specimen drift effects during data collection. The software shall enable both qualitative and quantitative (standard and standardless) automated and user-interactive analysis of the EDS data, and shall be capable of both inputting and saving the hyperspectral data in EMSA/MAS format.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The EBSD detector shall contain a minimum of 640 x 480 pixels, and 12 bit or higher resolution camera. The system shall be capable of collecting EBSD patterns from a scanning electron microscope at the following minimum speeds: (i) 880 EBSD patterns per second using 80 x 60 pixel images to allow for high throughput crystallographic mapping (ii) 620 EBSD patterns per second using 160 x 120 pixel images to allow for improved angular resolution indexing while still allowing for high throughput mapping. The EBSD system shall be capable of storing the EBSD patterns in a lossless format directly to disk at the speeds listed above, to enable re-indexing of the data post experiment. The system shall be supplied with two extra phosphor screens for the EBSD detector.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> The EBSD system software shall allow for collection of crystallographic maps and automatic indexing of the EBSD patterns using Hough transform-based methods, and indexed maps shall be exportable to text file (ASCII) format.</p>

The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implement by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support the continuation of current efforts relating to the effective AFCS/TCMS which is composed of planning guidance, Computer Aided Draft Designs (CADD), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE), Bill of Materials (BOM), Theater Oriented Guide Specifications (TOGS) and logistics data with an automated data base that proscribes installations, austere facilities and other contingency structures and works commonly required by military forces for base development, lines of communication, and tactical operation support.  This action will be a modification to the existing firm fixed price contract.  The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned through September 2012.

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (OCT 2010) applies to this acquisition and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition, as such consider the following clauses checked:</p>

<p>Broad Agency Announcement for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies for Reducing Various Environmental Problems<br />General Information<br /><br />Document Type: Re-posting for FY11<br />Solicitation Number: AFCEEBAA-11-001<br />Reference: AFCEEBAA-08-001 original March 27, 2008<br />Posted Date: 02 Nov 10</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION is amended as follows:<br /><br />&bull; The Point of Contact for all technical and contractual questions will be Amanda Reyes, Contract Specialist (Contractor) at Amanda.Reyes.1.ctr@us.af.mil. <br /><br /><br />Notes:<br />This is FY11 BAA announcement based off the previous announcement FY08 AFCEEBAA-08-001 dated March 27, 2008. FY10 BAA (Phase I and II) proposals are expired with the new FY11 BAA announcement. If you would like to be reconsidered under this announcement you will need to re-submit as stated below.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field. The areas of need include:</p>
<p>1. Characterization - Proposals should focus on improved methods for effective detection, quantification, monitoring, fate and transport modeling of NAPLs and innovative methodologies for sampling, data validation, and human health and ecological risk assessments for explosive residuals at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>2. Emerging Contaminants - Proposals should include sampling and analytical methodologies or innovative treatment technologies for contaminants currently on USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations.</p>
<p>3. Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) - Proposals should describe technologies and/or methodologies that reduce the labor requirements, sampling and analyses of waste generated, energy requirements, or other costs associated with LTM programs. Such technologies could include new sensors, analytical methodologies, or statistical methods.</p>
<p>4. Pollution Prevention - Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include some quantifiable measure for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component.</p>
<p>5. Remediation - Proposals should demonstrate/validate innovative and/or sustainable technologies for enhanced recovery of mobile LNAPL, removal of recoverable DNAPL, in-situ treatment of residual LNAPL in vadose zone soils, in-situ treatment of residual DNAPL in unconsolidated soils or fractured bedrock environments, or improved treatment of explosives residuals in soil, runoff, and groundwater.</p>
<p>Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I requires completion of a 2 page proposal summary form (white paper), which is found along with instructions attached to this solicitation and can also be obtained at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. Additionally the U.S. Air Force "BAA Guide For Industry March 2008" is attached and on the BAA website. Each electronic form shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 16 DECEMBER 2010. Phase I submittals received after 16 December 2010 per FAR52.215-1(c)(3). Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs are notified electronically via email to submit a Phase II proposal; those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Note: To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required. <br /><br />***Please direct all question of a contracting and technical nature to the Point of Contacts below to help facilitate better coordination. All Q&amp;A will be posted through FedBiz Ops in a timely manner. All other deadlines and information remain the same. ****</p>

<p>This acquisition is to procure&nbsp; (175) Themis Assy, SUPIIe, 1024 MB Memory Modules (MFR# 31-110165-005) which are essential to the System Server Unit (SSU).</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br /><br />Themis USPIIIi is a VME SPARC Single Board Computer (SBC) that is a critical component to the MCE S/W program. Recent MCE S/W enhancements exceeded the current on board memory capacity and memory upgrade was required to maintain operational capabilities. Due to the proprietary nature of the Themis SBC, only the Themis name brand memory is approved and known to be functionally compatible. The USPIIe-USB memory modules are custom designed for Themis. These modules meet the physical constraints of the USPIIe motherboard they plug into. The module design electrically follows the Sun memory interface, but mechanically is specific to the USPIIe board. There are no off-the-shelf or third party modules that meet the physical requirements. The Themis memory modules are the only ones to meet the system performance specification. The increase in memory is to allow us to process data faster with a greater through put to the Operation Module. It allows us to communicate with other Tactical Air Operations Modules (TAOM). If the TAOM cannot perform its primary function then the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) is at risk. If the Operations Module is unable to perform its mission then the Air Control Squadron will not be functional. <br /><br />The custom memory modules are designed only for the ThemisUSPIIe-USB boards. The memory modules are shape and form fit only for the<br />Themis USPIIe-USB boards. The Themis Memory Modules are proprietary and are the only brand approved to be functionally compatible. <br /><br />Themis is the only Brand acceptable to the Government. No other Brand will meet the government needs.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is DTMA-91-Q-2011-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotations.</p>
<p>The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46.</p>
<p><strong>This RFQ is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses.</strong> The NAICS code is 541820 with a small business size standard of $7M.</p>
<p>This RFQ is for the procurement of one Speechwriter for a fixed price performance period of one year.</p>
<p>The primary place of performance is U.S. Department Transportation Maritime Administration Headquarters at 1200 New Jersey Ave, S.E., Washington, D.C. with the exception of necessary local travel and occasional telework as approved by the Director of Congressional and Public Affairs.

<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) works in many areas involving ships and shipping, shipbuilding, port operations, vessel operations, national security, environment, and safety. The agency is also charged with maintaining the health of the merchant marine, since commercial mariners, vessels, and intermodal facilities are vital for supporting national security, and so the agency provides support and information for current mariners, extensive support for educating future mariners, and programs to educate America's young people about the vital role the maritime industry plays in the lives of all Americans. The Maritime Administration also maintains a Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet of cargo ships in reserve to provide surge sealift during war and national emergencies, and is responsible for disposing of ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, as well as other non-combatant Government ships, as they become obsolete.<br /><br />The Maritime Administration's Office of Congressional and Public Affairs must expend significant efforts to promote the use of waterborne transportation and its seamless integration with other segments of the transportation system, and the viability of the U.S. merchant marine. This office uses a variety of methods to inform the public about the Department's initiatives including, but not limited to speeches by agency officials, topic-specific articles, informational brochures, news releases, Congressional testimony, stakeholder briefings, online content and other one-way and interactive communications tools. <br />The Maritime Administration's Office of Congressional and Public Affairs requires the services of a dedicated speechwriter primarily to prepare speeches and talking points for the Administrator and Deputy Administrator, who make a high number of presentations and speeches for the administration, but also to assist in the development of material in these other areas to ensure a uniform agency message. The Administrator and Deputy Administrator speak on a range of topics related to the maritime industry including, but not limited to: U.S. Flag matters, Merchant Marines, piracy, the Recovery Act, ship recycling and environmental stewardship, the RRF, the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy, cargo preference, Maritime Security Program, Title XI, and other administration priorities.<br /><br /><strong>Objective<br /></strong>The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain speechwriter services that will include writing and editing speeches, articles, informational brochures, news releases, Congressional testimony, web content, and other written materials. The consultant speechwriter will report to the Director of Congressional and Public Affairs and will collaborate directly with senior agency officials to write, edit, and circulate speeches for approval. <br /><br /><strong>Functions<br /></strong>Become familiar with MARAD's mission, programs and activities. The contractor will use this knowledge to create written materials to communicate these programs and initiatives effectively to public audiences.<br /><br />Write and edit speeches, news releases, topic-specific articles, publications, web content, Congressional testimony, and other materials as assigned.<br /><br />Interview and work closely with MARAD senior leadership and program experts in order to write effective speeches, talking points, articles, Congressional testimony, and other documents that accurately reflect and effectively communicate the programs and objectives of the organization and its leadership.<br /><br />Review publications and materials written by other authors and make recommendations for improvement, or assume ownership of draft documents and make improvements based on the organization's goals, stakeholder needs, and the highest standards for accuracy and excellence.<br /><br /><strong>Deliverables and Schedule<br /></strong>The consultant speechwriter will produce approximately five speeches per week (as needed) for the Administrator and Deputy Administrator, usually, but not always, shorter than 1,500 words. The individual must be sufficiently flexible to participate in meetings and conversations on short notice. The contractor will be expected to submit fully completed products for printing on tight deadlines with reasonable, but often limited lead time. <br /><br /><strong>Reporting Requirements<br /></strong>The contractor will provide written and oral reports during meetings and upon request. The contractor will also provide written documents fulfilling the above tasks as assigned.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quote Submissions<br /></span></strong>Interested parties shall submit a fixed price quote for services for the period of one year from time award. The response package shall also include the following:<br /><br />1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For a company quote submission</span>: At least two references (for the company) for the same or similar type and complexity of the services required in the RFQ for work performed during the previous two calendar years.

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Shelter and Settlements Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($84,697 - $110,104 - not eligible for locality pay). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.

<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Shelter and Settlements Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.<br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Shelter and Settlements (S&amp;S) Advisor who will provide OFDA with expert technical assistance in all aspects of shelter and settlements sector activities such as assessment, strategic policy and programming development, linkage of shelter and settlements issues, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Shelter and Settlement's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct initial sector-specific assessments and make expert technical recommendations for appropriate activities, both for the initial disaster response phase and for longer-term disaster risk reduction related to shelter and settlements sector activities.

<p>&bull; Provide technical review of submitted proposals and/or concept notes to ensure that proposed activities and programs align with best practice in the shelter and settlements sector.</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and evaluate OFDA-funded shelter and settlements sector activities in relation to other sectors (e.g., livelihoods, Disaster Risk Reduction, WASH, etc.). Work requires extensive experience in and understanding of integration with other sectors (e.g., protection, livelihoods, environment, WASH, health, DRR, etc.), as well as experience and understanding of transitional, recovery, and reconstruction issues related to shelter and settlements.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare written and oral reports on shelter sector activities and issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct or support studies to examine market conditions for building materials and non-housing portions of the building stock in affected areas. Apply new developments in the shelter and settlements sector to OFDA programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate workshops and lead trainings on shelter and settlements to build capacity of OFDA and its partners.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate shelter and settlements sector activities across a wide range of actors (UN, NGOs, governments, etc.) to ensure consistency of programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide shelter and settlements assessments following a disaster and decide on sector strategy and programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), Response Management Teams (RMTs) and assessment teams. Responsible for leading teams or guiding and coordinating the work of other technical staff in the shelter and settlements sector.</p>
<p>&bull; Work entails engagement and representation at local, national, international, and academic fora, and with host country officials and civil society organizations, as well as other related activities, to include training and publication as part of education and outreach.</p>

<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS BAA ANNOUNCEMENT IS MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE NEXT RESPONSE DATE FOR PHASE I SUBMITTALS. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 8 DECEMBER 2008. THE PROCESS IS THE SAME AS ORIGANLLY STATED IN THE MARCH 27, 2008 ANNOUNCEMENT. A TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT IS PROVIDED, MS ERICA BECVAR, AFCEE/TDV, 210-536-4314, e-mail </strong><a href="mailto:erica.becvar@brooks.af.mil"><strong>erica.becvar@brooks.af.mil</strong></a><strong> .</strong></p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Restoration Branch, Technology Transfer Office (TDV) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open for one year and will be advertised annually. This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Air Force (AF) operations and apply to Air Force installations worldwide. The key focus of this effort is to further develop demonstration/field-tested remediation, contaminated site characterization and monitoring, and pollution prevention technologies and methodologies that serve as an innovative means to save money and time while achieving compliance with all air, soil, and water regulatory requirements and Air Force policies and technical guidance. The goal is to identify more technically advanced, efficient, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions than are currently available. Such technologies and methodologies should aid the US Air Force in reaching the remedy-in-place (RIP) goal of 2012 or optimizing current remediation or monitoring systems already in place. The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase. The remedial technologies areas of interest include, but are not limited to, effective dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) characterization, monitoring, fate and transport, detection, and remediation; improve/optimize remediation and long-term monitoring (LTM) technologies; assessment and mitigation of hazards associated with vapor intrusion; remedial techniques and methods to more effectively treat soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents; implementation of rapid site characterization through definitive field-based analytical methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi VOCs, and other common contaminants. Additional areas of interest include innovative pollution prevention techniques, innovative site characterization approaches and tools, new and innovative quality assurance methodologies, and innovative monitoring and optimization systems for existing remediation operations (e.g., pump-and-treat) including sensors and data management systems. Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I Offerors submit proposals by completing a short questionnaire on the AFCEE BAA web page developed specifically to facilitate proposal submittal in the BAA program. The requested information includes: description of the technology (synonymous with methodology, as applicable) being proposed and a discussion of the technical benefits to include the type of site and specific problem addressed; contamination and media treated; description of how project supports the Remedy-in-Place (RIP)/Response Complete (RC) Goal of 2012; qualifications of the offeror; estimated cost range of the demonstration/field testing of the technology; and approximated time to complete the proposed effort. Limits to the length of each section are noted in the web-based proposal form. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 8 December 2008. Phase I submittals received after&nbsp;8&nbsp;December 2008, may or may not be evaluated. However, these proposals will be held for possible action until expiration of this BAA. The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the same selection criteria used to evaluate Phase II proposals. It is critical that the offeror convey the above information accurately and concisely so that proposal evaluators can judge the merits of the proposed demonstration/field testing of the technology. Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II. Offerors whose proposals are not selected for Phase II are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link. To be eligible for award submission of Phase I is required. Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information: Technology or methodology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration/field testing, pilot-scale or treatability studies. The technology or methodology must be described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application. The proposal shall include the types of contaminants treated, the media (i.e., soil, groundwater) treated, and any limitations known to affect the application of the technology or methodology. Benefits to the USAF of using the proposed technology or methodology. This should include a comparison with existing technologies or methodologies used to treat the same contaminants, and how the proposed technology or methodology improves cleanup over existing technology or methodology and/or lowers the cost of environmental restoration/prevention. The objectives of the proposed technology or methodology demonstration/field testing, the tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration/field testing, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for the demonstration/field test.

This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Air Force (AF) operations and apply to Air Force installations worldwide. The key focus of this effort is to further develop demonstration/field-tested remediation, contaminated site characterization and monitoring, and pollution prevention technologies and methodologies that serve as an innovative means to save money and time while achieving compliance with all air, soil, and water regulatory requirements and Air Force policies and technical guidance. The goal is to identify more technically advanced, efficient, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions than are currently available. Such technologies and methodologies should aid the US Air Force in reaching the remedy-in-place (RIP) goal of 2012 or optimizing current remediation or monitoring systems already in place. The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase. The remedial technologies areas of interest include, but are not limited to, effective dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) characterization, monitoring, fate and transport, detection, and remediation; improve/optimize remediation and long-term monitoring (LTM) technologies; assessment and mitigation of hazards associated with vapor intrusion; remedial techniques and methods to more effectively treat soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents; implementation of rapid site characterization through definitive field-based analytical methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi VOCs, and other common contaminants. Additional areas of interest include innovative pollution prevention techniques, innovative site characterization approaches and tools, new and innovative quality assurance methodologies, and innovative monitoring and optimization systems for existing remediation operations (e.g., pump-and-treat) including sensors and data management systems. Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I Offerors submit proposals by completing a short questionnaire on the AFCEE BAA web page developed specifically to facilitate proposal submittal in the BAA program. The requested information includes: description of the technology (synonymous with methodology, as applicable) being proposed and a discussion of the technical benefits to include the type of site and specific problem addressed; contamination and media treated; description of how project supports the Remedy-in-Place (RIP)/Response Complete (RC) Goal of 2012; qualifications of the offeror; estimated cost range of the demonstration/field testing of the technology; and approximated time to complete the proposed effort. Limits to the length of each section are noted in the web-based proposal form. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 8 December 2008. Phase I submittals received after&nbsp;8&nbsp;December 2008, may or may not be evaluated. However, these proposals will be held for possible action until expiration of this BAA. The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the same selection criteria used to evaluate Phase II proposals. It is critical that the offeror convey the above information accurately and concisely so that proposal evaluators can judge the merits of the proposed demonstration/field testing of the technology. Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Calorically Restricted Rodents <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-146R
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement was previously synopsized as 541712, but is now being corrected to 112990.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to continue to maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined, calorically restricted rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony was initially developed and maintained within controlled barrier environments where the environmental conditions are defined and the animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.<br />Caloric restriction, in which the calories are restricted to maintain a stable adult body weight but all other nutritional needs are met, is the only proven intervention to extend lifespan and improve health. Calorically restricted rodents are used to investigate the cellular and physiological biology of normal aging. A colony of aged, calorically restricted laboratory rodents, of defined genetic backgrounds and health status, is an integral part of the NIA's program of research on aging.</p>
<p>Under the current contract mechanism, the original expected duration of the colony is nine years, however, a two (2)-year extension was executed because the NIA needed more time to evaluate the use of the colony before deciding on renewal of this resource.</p>
<p>Development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase took approximately three (3) years. Once the breeding colony was up to its required size, animals began entering into the caloric restricted colony and entries are slated to continue through year 9 of the contract.</p>
<p><br />The animals are housed in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For these reasons, the existing colony cannot be transferred to a new Contractor.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the caloric restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br /><br />The Statement of Work consists of these major phases: A. Breeding Colony Development; B. Breeding Colony Maintenance; C. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D. Feeding Protocol; E. Environmental Requirements; F. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring, G. Shipment of Animals to Investigators; H. Cost of Animals to Investigators; and I. Reporting Requirements;</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire at the direction of the Project Officer breeding stock and shall re-derive the stock by cesarean section or embryo transfer. The Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. Foster mothers shall be of a strain that is easily distinguished from the NIA strains by both color and genetic markers.</p>
<p>II. Breeding Colony Maintenance</p>
<p>Re-derived foundation colony animals shall be entered into the barriers without contamination by pathogens or parasites and shall be maintained as such. Discrete space shall be provided for the breeding and aging colonies within each barrier. Breeding colony animals shall be removed from the barrier only for monitoring of genetic purity or colony health, or for other purposes as directed by the Project Officer. In both colony segments, no animals other than mice and rats shall be housed within the barrier and no other types of activity other than colony breeding and maintenance shall be permitted in the barrier rooms used to breed and maintain the NIA colony. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies. Breeding colony maintenance shall conform to the following requirements.</p>
<p><br />III. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony</p>
<p>A. Rodents shall be weaned at 3 - 4 weeks of age and shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth. Animals born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />B. Weaned rodents shall be housed individually and fed ad libitum until the commencement of the caloric restriction regimen. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall include the strain, gender, feeding protocol (AL or CR when assigned), and date of birth.</p>
<p>IV. Feeding Protocol</p>
<p>A. Ad libitum (AL) fed animals assigned to the aging colony shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount. The kind of ingredient shall be absolute; the percentage of the kinds of ingredients may vary dependent on nutrient content, provided the final formulation post-autoclaving remains consistent with NIH31 diet. NIH31 shall be made in random weight pellets appropriate for feeding mice and rats.</p>
<p>B. Calorically restricted (CR) animals shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet but is enriched 1.67-fold for all vitamins and minerals such that 40% restricted calorie intake provides 100% of the vitamin and mineral intake of ad libitum fed animals. This diet is called NIH31-Fortified. NIH31-Fortified shall be provided in known-weight pellets from 2.5 to 5.0 grams in 0.5 gram increments. The diet shall be of a consistency that prevents excessive crumbling of the pellets.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall measure food intake in the first cohort (DOB) of each strain and gender entered into the aging colony, to verify that food intake in the new colony is consistent with the levels on which the feeding protocol is based. Food intake shall be measured by providing an excess number of food pellets of known weight each day and weighing the food remaining the next day. Food intake shall be measured daily for the entire cohort from the age of 5 weeks through the age of 12 weeks. The data shall be compiled in an Excel spreadsheet and the up-dated spreadsheet shall be provided to the Project Officer weekly.</p>
<p>V. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p><br />VI. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, diet and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report. <br />B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. <br />C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p><br />VII. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />A. Animals from the aging calorically restricted rodent colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary for the animals, prepared under VI.B. above, shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VIII. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Animals produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each animal to the investigators shall be determined by the Project Officer. The current charge is $6.00 per month of age per mouse and $12.00 per month of age for rats; these costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs and the cost of food ordered. Current charges for food are $2.00 per Kg for NIH31, $10.00 per Kg for NIH31-Fortified, and a flat fee of $12.00 per food type per shipment if the food is shipped by truck with the animals. If food is shipped by common courier, the investigator will pay the prevailing rate.</p>
<p><br />IX. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>A. Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, genetic purity, environment or environmental control, and any differences noted between barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender, diet and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six-month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report, A weekly up-date of the food intake measurements during the initiation of the aging colony and a complete quarterly health monitoring reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term F-344 Rat Colony <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-147R
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement was previously synopsized as 541712, but is now being corrected to 112990. Please note above the new date for submissions is November 19, 2010. Capability statements initially submitted must be re-submitted as the corrected NAICS code could effect eligibility.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. This colony is intended to replace the existing aged F344 rat colony developed under NIA contract N01-AG-4-0008.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is ten years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Project Officer. During years 3 through 8, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 9 and 10, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 9 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year ten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be in helicobacter-negative barriers. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the agingcolony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development<br /><br />All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding rats and all rats entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government.</p>
<p>The numbers of breeding rats to be maintained shall be at a level that permits the entry to the aging colony of male and female weanling rats at the rate directed by the Project Officer. Each barrier shall house approximately one half, by age and gender, of all animals entered into the aging colony. The Government may alter the number of entries as research demands change during the performance period. Alterations in the number of rats entered require the specific written approval of the Contracting Officer. The initial aging colony entry levels shall be 1000 males and 300 females per month to be split approximately equally between the two barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />II. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>A. Rats shall be weaned at approximately 4 weeks of age and each rat shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth using codes specified by the Project Officer. Rats born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Weaned rats shall be separated by sex at weaning and held in lots of 2-5 animals per cage. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall be color coded by year to identify age cohorts. Recombination or consolidation of cages is prohibited unless approved in writing by the COTR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p><br />IV. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on rats unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. Selection of animals for monitoring shall be evenly divided between colony segments and represent both genders. Thirty (30) rats shall be submitted for routine health monitoring each quarter unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer. Shipping and laboratory fees shall be chargeable to the contract. Rats to be submitted for routine monitoring shall be a minimum of 4 months old. Approximately half of the rats tested each quarter shall be 4-12 months old and the other half 12-20 months old. The schedule for health monitoring shall be developed by the Contractor and shall require the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p><br />V. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />A. Animals from the aging F344 rat colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary prepared under V.B. above for the animals shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VI. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Rats produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each rat to the investigators, consisting of a basic acquisition cost plus a maintenance charge determined by age of the rat at shipment, shall be determined by the Project Officer. These costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs. Total cost (as charged to the consignee) of animals (acquisition, maintenance, crate, water source and shipping charge) which are not useable when received by the consignee due to negligence on the part of the Contractor or subcontractors, shall be borne by the Contractor and are not chargeable to the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, environmental control, genetic purity, or any differences noted between the barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report shall be submitted to the Project Officer in accordance with a format approved by the Project Officer. Electronic transfer of the census in Excel spreadsheet format is the preferred means. The weekly census report is due to the Project Officer no later than one week (7 calendar days) from date of census. Access to a "real-time" electronic inventory may take the place of the weekly census report subject to approval by the Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with existing standing colonies of aged, genetically defined F344 rates for use by investigators in studies of aging, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified F344 rat colony; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Hybrid Rats <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-148R
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The NAICS code for this requirement was&nbsp;previously synopsized as 541712, but is now being corrected to 112990.&nbsp; Please note above the new date for submissions is November 19, 2010. Capability statements initially submitted must be re-submitted as the corrected NAICS code could effect eligibility.</span></strong></p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid (F344BN F1) rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. This colony is intended to replace the existing aged colony developed under NIA contract N01-AG-5-0006.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged BN and F344BN F1 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is nine years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Project Officer. During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year 9.</p>
<p><br />This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be in helicobacter-negative barriers. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire, when necessary, F344 and BN breeding stock as directed by the Project Officer. All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding rats and all rats entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government.</p>
<p>The foundation animals for each colony segment shall be re-derived by cesarean section or embryo transfer, shall be entered from isolators into the barrier system without contamination by pathogens or parasites, and shall be maintained as such. The Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. Discrete space within the re-derivation area shall be provided for re-derivation of the rats. No other animals shall be housed within an isolator housing the rats from this contract, other than this contract's animals and foster mothers. Foster mothers shall be of a strain that is easily distinguished from the F344 and BN rats by both color and genetic markers. Health monitoring shall be performed on the colony of rats to be used as foster mothers within sixty (60) days before the initiation of re-derivation and the results of that monitoring shall be provided to the Project Officer within ten (10) calendar days of receipt by the Contractor. This health monitoring shall specifically include helicobacter status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II Breeding Colony Maintenance</p>
<p>Discrete space shall be provided for the breeding and aging colonies within each segment barrier. Breeding colony animals shall be removed from the barrier only for monitoring of genetic purity or colony health, or for other purposes as directed by the Project Officer. In both colony segments no other types of animals other than mice or rats and no other types of activity other than colony maintenance and breeding shall be permitted in the barrier rooms used to breed and maintain the rat colony as specified. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies. Breeding colony maintenance shall conform to the following requirements.</p>
<p><br />III. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>A. Rats shall be weaned at approximately 4 weeks of age and each rat shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth using codes specified by the Project Officer. Rats born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Weaned rats shall be separated by sex at weaning and held in lots of 2-5 animals per cage. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards will be color coded by year to identify age cohorts. Recombination or consolidation of cages is prohibited.</p>
<p><br />IV. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V. Colony Evaluation, Characterization and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on rats that die within the colony unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mutant mice of defined genotypes, including genetically engineered and spontaneously arising mutations, for use by investigators in studies of aging. The word &lsquo;mutant' is used here to refer to transgenic, knockout and spontaneously arising mutant genotypes. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. Each line of mice will be characterized for the specific mutation and control animals will be provided for some lines where needed. This contract will replace the existing colony developed under contract N01-AG-4-0009.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mice of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this contract is eleven years. Four lines were obtained and it is estimated that between 300 and 600 mice per year will be entered into the aging colony for each line.</p>
<p>&bull; Ames Dwarf <br />&bull; Snell Dwarf <br />&bull; C57BL/6-tg (UBC-GFP)30Scha/J <br />&bull; B6;C3H-Tg (Prnp-SNCA)M83/Vle Tac</p>
<p><br />Animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators, such that young animals enter the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period of the contract will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the end of year 9 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population will decline over the final two years of the contract to a point of few animals at the end of year 11.</p>
<p>The colony shall be maintained behind two independent barriers, specific pathogen- and parasite- free, for the entire contract period. The two barriers do not need to be geographically separated. Both barriers shall specifically be helicobacter-negative. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Supply of the Mouse Genotype</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall acquire the genotypes specified by the Project Officer and shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of each of these genotypes which serve as the progenitors for the mice in the aging colony. All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding mice and all mice entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government. Acquisition of lines for this contract colony does not confer any rights to the Contractor to commercialize the lines. The Contractor shall not commercialize any lines of mice acquired for or under this contract.</p>
<p>II Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. Mating, isolation, and primary enclosures shall meet or exceed minimum floor space requirements per mouse, and population size per cage as stated in the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html/index.html). All primary enclosures and bedding type shall require the prior approval of the Project Officer. Mating cages shall be numbered consecutively.<br />B. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space within the barriers for the breeding and aging colonies. The barrier systems or isolation rooms shall be constructed and operated to effectively exclude pathogens, ecto-, endo-parasites as well as vermin.</p>
<p><br />III. Breeding Colony</p>
<p>The foundation animals for each breeding colony shall be re-derived by cesarean section or embryo transfer, shall be entered from isolators into the barrier system without contamination by pathogens or parasites, and shall be maintained as such. The Contractor shall provide discrete space within the rederivation area for the lines and shall not house other animals within the isolators other than this contract's mice and their foster mothers. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies.</p>
<p><br /><br />IV. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>Mice shall be weaned at approximately 3 to 4 weeks of age and shall be group housed in the aging colony with a maximum of 5 mice per cage. Generally, same sex littermates will be housed together or same sex non-littermates of the same line of mice and born within a week of each other may be housed together. Specific housing protocols may be specified by the Project Officer, such as for dwarf mutant mice that require wild-type mice in the cage in order to maintain body temperature. All offspring from the breeding colony shall be entered into the aging colony unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V. Colony Evaluation, Characterization and Monitoring</p>
<p>All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by strain, sex, barrier and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on mice unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the animals were sent for evaluation. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences in mortality between lines shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. Numbers of each genotype, sex and barrier submitted for monitoring shall be determined by the Project Officer. Up to fifty (50) mice total shall be submitted for routine health monitoring each quarter unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer. Specimens from the colonies of mice used to generate foster mothers shall also be submitted for health monitoring each quarter.<br />C The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />Animals from the aging mouse colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as specified by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary for the animals, prepared under V.B. above, and a copy of the genotyping results for the animals shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p><br />VII. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Mice produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each mouse to the investigators, a basic acquisition cost plus a maintenance charge determined by age of mouse, shall be determined by the Project Officer. Initial costs are expected to be $20.00 plus $5.00 per month of age, per mouse. These costs will be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs. Total cost (as charged to the consignee) of animals (acquisition, maintenance, crate and shipping) which are not useable when received by the consignee due to negligence on the part of the contractor or subcontractors, shall be borne by the Contractor and are not chargeable to the Government.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Calorically Restricted Rodents <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-146R
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The NAICS code for this requirement was previously synopsized as 541712, but is now being corrected to 112990. Please note above the new date for submissions is November 19, 2010.&nbsp; Capability statements initially submitted must be re-submitted as the corrected NAICS code could effect eligibility.</strong></span></p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to continue to maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined, calorically restricted rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony was initially developed and maintained within controlled barrier environments where the environmental conditions are defined and the animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.<br />Caloric restriction, in which the calories are restricted to maintain a stable adult body weight but all other nutritional needs are met, is the only proven intervention to extend lifespan and improve health. Calorically restricted rodents are used to investigate the cellular and physiological biology of normal aging. A colony of aged, calorically restricted laboratory rodents, of defined genetic backgrounds and health status, is an integral part of the NIA's program of research on aging.</p>
<p>Under the current contract mechanism, the original expected duration of the colony is nine years, however, a two (2)-year extension was executed because the NIA needed more time to evaluate the use of the colony before deciding on renewal of this resource.</p>
<p>Development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase took approximately three (3) years. Once the breeding colony was up to its required size, animals began entering into the caloric restricted colony and entries are slated to continue through year 9 of the contract.</p>
<p><br />The animals are housed in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For these reasons, the existing colony cannot be transferred to a new Contractor.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the caloric restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br /><br />The Statement of Work consists of these major phases: A. Breeding Colony Development; B. Breeding Colony Maintenance; C. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D. Feeding Protocol; E. Environmental Requirements; F. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring, G. Shipment of Animals to Investigators; H. Cost of Animals to Investigators; and I. Reporting Requirements;</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire at the direction of the Project Officer breeding stock and shall re-derive the stock by cesarean section or embryo transfer. The Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. Foster mothers shall be of a strain that is easily distinguished from the NIA strains by both color and genetic markers.</p>
<p>II. Breeding Colony Maintenance</p>
<p>Re-derived foundation colony animals shall be entered into the barriers without contamination by pathogens or parasites and shall be maintained as such. Discrete space shall be provided for the breeding and aging colonies within each barrier. Breeding colony animals shall be removed from the barrier only for monitoring of genetic purity or colony health, or for other purposes as directed by the Project Officer. In both colony segments, no animals other than mice and rats shall be housed within the barrier and no other types of activity other than colony breeding and maintenance shall be permitted in the barrier rooms used to breed and maintain the NIA colony. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies. Breeding colony maintenance shall conform to the following requirements.</p>
<p><br />III. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony</p>
<p>A. Rodents shall be weaned at 3 - 4 weeks of age and shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth. Animals born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />B. Weaned rodents shall be housed individually and fed ad libitum until the commencement of the caloric restriction regimen. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall include the strain, gender, feeding protocol (AL or CR when assigned), and date of birth.</p>
<p>IV. Feeding Protocol</p>
<p>A. Ad libitum (AL) fed animals assigned to the aging colony shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount. The kind of ingredient shall be absolute; the percentage of the kinds of ingredients may vary dependent on nutrient content, provided the final formulation post-autoclaving remains consistent with NIH31 diet. NIH31 shall be made in random weight pellets appropriate for feeding mice and rats.</p>
<p>B. Calorically restricted (CR) animals shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet but is enriched 1.67-fold for all vitamins and minerals such that 40% restricted calorie intake provides 100% of the vitamin and mineral intake of ad libitum fed animals. This diet is called NIH31-Fortified. NIH31-Fortified shall be provided in known-weight pellets from 2.5 to 5.0 grams in 0.5 gram increments. The diet shall be of a consistency that prevents excessive crumbling of the pellets.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall measure food intake in the first cohort (DOB) of each strain and gender entered into the aging colony, to verify that food intake in the new colony is consistent with the levels on which the feeding protocol is based. Food intake shall be measured by providing an excess number of food pellets of known weight each day and weighing the food remaining the next day. Food intake shall be measured daily for the entire cohort from the age of 5 weeks through the age of 12 weeks. The data shall be compiled in an Excel spreadsheet and the up-dated spreadsheet shall be provided to the Project Officer weekly.</p>
<p>V. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p><br />VI. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, diet and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report. <br />B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. <br />C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p><br />VII. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />A. Animals from the aging calorically restricted rodent colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary for the animals, prepared under VI.B. above, shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VIII. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Animals produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each animal to the investigators shall be determined by the Project Officer. The current charge is $6.00 per month of age per mouse and $12.00 per month of age for rats; these costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs and the cost of food ordered. Current charges for food are $2.00 per Kg for NIH31, $10.00 per Kg for NIH31-Fortified, and a flat fee of $12.00 per food type per shipment if the food is shipped by truck with the animals. If food is shipped by common courier, the investigator will pay the prevailing rate.</p>
<p><br />IX. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>A. Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, genetic purity, environment or environmental control, and any differences noted between barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender, diet and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six-month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report, A weekly up-date of the food intake measurements during the initiation of the aging colony and a complete quarterly health monitoring reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer.</p>
<p>Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with existing Long-Term Colony of Calorically Restricted Rodents, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified caloric restricted colony; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful. Respondents must send two original copies via mail and one electronic copy via email; (4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>responses should be received no later than November 19 , 2010 at 2:00 PM Local Time</strong></span>; (5) include respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (6) send responses to this notice via email to csager@mail.nih.gov The original statements mailed using the U.S. Postal Service should be sent to ATTN: Craig Sager, National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions - NIDA Neuroscience COAC, NIA R&amp;D Contracts Management Section, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Room 8154, MSC 9661, Bethesda, MD 20892-9661.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. This colony is intended to replace the existing aged F344 rat colony developed under NIA contract N01-AG-4-0008.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is ten years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Project Officer. During years 3 through 8, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 9 and 10, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 9 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year ten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be in helicobacter-negative barriers. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the agingcolony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development<br /><br />All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding rats and all rats entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government.</p>
<p>The numbers of breeding rats to be maintained shall be at a level that permits the entry to the aging colony of male and female weanling rats at the rate directed by the Project Officer. Each barrier shall house approximately one half, by age and gender, of all animals entered into the aging colony. The Government may alter the number of entries as research demands change during the performance period. Alterations in the number of rats entered require the specific written approval of the Contracting Officer. The initial aging colony entry levels shall be 1000 males and 300 females per month to be split approximately equally between the two barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />II. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>A. Rats shall be weaned at approximately 4 weeks of age and each rat shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth using codes specified by the Project Officer. Rats born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Weaned rats shall be separated by sex at weaning and held in lots of 2-5 animals per cage. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall be color coded by year to identify age cohorts. Recombination or consolidation of cages is prohibited unless approved in writing by the COTR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p><br />IV. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on rats unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. Selection of animals for monitoring shall be evenly divided between colony segments and represent both genders. Thirty (30) rats shall be submitted for routine health monitoring each quarter unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer. Shipping and laboratory fees shall be chargeable to the contract. Rats to be submitted for routine monitoring shall be a minimum of 4 months old. Approximately half of the rats tested each quarter shall be 4-12 months old and the other half 12-20 months old. The schedule for health monitoring shall be developed by the Contractor and shall require the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p><br />V. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />A. Animals from the aging F344 rat colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary prepared under V.B. above for the animals shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VI. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Rats produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each rat to the investigators, consisting of a basic acquisition cost plus a maintenance charge determined by age of the rat at shipment, shall be determined by the Project Officer. These costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs. Total cost (as charged to the consignee) of animals (acquisition, maintenance, crate, water source and shipping charge) which are not useable when received by the consignee due to negligence on the part of the Contractor or subcontractors, shall be borne by the Contractor and are not chargeable to the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, environmental control, genetic purity, or any differences noted between the barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report shall be submitted to the Project Officer in accordance with a format approved by the Project Officer. Electronic transfer of the census in Excel spreadsheet format is the preferred means. The weekly census report is due to the Project Officer no later than one week (7 calendar days) from date of census. Access to a "real-time" electronic inventory may take the place of the weekly census report subject to approval by the Project Officer.</p>

<DESC>Amendment number 0004 will be posted to the ASFI website on 12 November 2010.  This amendment is necessary due to a significant shortfall in funding currently available for the 'seed' project (Kings Bay Entrance Channel); therefore, the scope of work for this project has been significant reduced by this amendment.  In accordance with FAR 15.206(c), all offerors who submitted a proposal on 29 October 2010 are hereby informed that a revised pricing proposal is required in accordance with this amendment; however, offerors shall NOT re-submit their technical proposals.  The only documents required for submission in response to this amendment are:  (1) Signed copy of the SF 30, Amendment 0004; (2) Page number SF1442-A1, Addendum to the Standard Form 1442; (3) Section 00010A, Line Items and Pricing Schedule; (4) Letter stating whether or not the offeror has equipment available for the Kings Bay Entrance Channel project; and (5) A revised Subcontracting Plan based on the revised prices submitted.  Responses will be due on 22 November 2010 at 4:00 p.m.  NOTE:  All offerors MUST submit a revised pricing proposal as indicated in the preceding paragraph whether or not they have equipment available.<BR><BR>REVISED DESCRIPTION OF WORK FOR INITIAL 'SEED' TASK ORDER PROJECT:  Maintenance Dredging, 46-Foot Project, Entrance Channel (Cut-1N), Kings Bay, Georgia and Fernandina Harbor, Nassau County, Florida.  Project work consists of maintenance dredging in Cut-1N of the Kings Bay Entrance Channel from Station 100+00 to Station 350+00. Dredging depth in the authorized channel will be required to a depth of 49 feet plus 2 feet of allowable overdepth. Beach compatible material excavated from the channel between Station 100+00 and Station 200+50 and the northern half of the channel (Range 1000 to 1200) from Station 200+50 to Station 230+00 will be placed in the North Beach Disposal Area (D/A-NB) located approximately 3.5 miles from the dredging areas. If excessive erosion occurs along the Fort Clinch shoreline prior to the start of dredging, a portion of the beach-quality material will be placed in the Fort Clinch Disposal Area (D/A-F) to restore protection of the fort structure. Non-beach compatible material excavated from the channel between Station 230+00 and Station 350+00 will be transported and placed in the Fernandina Ocean Disposal Area (D/A-O) located 14 miles southeast of the dredging areas. Incidental work includes endangered species monitoring, sea turtle non-capture trawl sweeping, turbidity monitoring, beach tilling, and vibration monitoring. Only coast guard certified hopper dredges will be allowed to work on this project.  Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.<BR>
