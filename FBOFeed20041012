U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 HORIZONTAL STABALIZER 
STATEMENT OF WORK
27 SEPT 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s horizontal stabilizer  (P/N  MY20164-3, MY20331-16).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide a complete, ready-to-install HU-25 horizontal stabilizer assembly.  The repaired horizontal stabilizer must meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.1.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of horizontal stabilizer repair.  First, a “return to service repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage, replacement of bushings and hardware.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is beyond the scope of a return to service repair and would include the replacement of skins, major extrusions, and fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for inspection, parts and labor.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, original Manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul horizontal stabilizers.
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM :
1.	MY20331-16 drawings
2.	Falcon 20 Maintenance Manual , PUB: 067P, Chapter 55
3.	F20/F200 Structural Repair Manual

b.	CG Technical Orders Horizontal Stabilizer:
1.	CGTO 1U-25A-3 (Structural Repair Manual)
2.	CGTO 1U-25A-4, Chapters 55 (Illustrated Parts Catalog)
e.	Data Availability:
1.	OEM drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the Coast Guard.
2.	Coast Guard specific CGTOs can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act FOIA).Submit a written request to:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This Request for Information is for planning purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION ISSUANCE.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) anticipates the issuance of a solicitation to provide Detention Officer Services at various sites in the Southern California area.  The anticipated start of performance is February 1, 2005.  The NAICS code is 561612 and the business size classification is $10.5 million.  The requirement is for a base period (12 months) and four one-year option periods.  Detention Officers are to provide both permanently identified post manning as well as a “Per call and as needed” armed and unarmed Detention Officers.  Per call Detention Officers shall respond within two hours of telephone notification.  Detention Officers are subject to satisfactory security clearances.  Services include oversight of alien detainees in the custody of Detention & Removal Operations (DRO) to include: adult and family groups in either a holding cell in the detention area, a hospital facility (either as an in-patient or out-patient) or lodged at a Government contracted hotel. Detention services also include escorting the detainee to medical appointments, court appearances and asylum interviews.  Also to provide courtroom inspection of visitor property, monitor CCTV room, fingerprinting, taking detainee intake photos, serving meals to the detainees, monitoring hold room cells and supervising detainee-cleaning crews.  Contractor is responsible for secure custody of all DRO detainees from the time the detainees are accepted for custody until an authorized Government official properly removes them from custody.  Adequate secure custody of detainees requires physical control of detainees at all times.  Services are required 24/7.  DHS is interested in determining whether any 8(a) vendors are capable of meeting the requirements.  However, all interested parties are encouraged to reply.  Contractors should submit geographical areas where they can provide detention services.  The current requirement is for Detention Officers in the Los Angeles, San Diego, and El Centro areas.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking small and minority business firms with the capability to continue to operate and maintain the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (ARP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. In 1998, recompetition of the current seven-year contract was not considered for the small business /8A set-aside program because capability statements from small businesses failed to demonstrate their ability to meet the Government’s requirements. Award was made to a large business firm. The current ARP contract is operated by the incumbent contractor under Contract N01-AI-85332 with McKesson BioServices, located in Rockville, Maryland.  The ARP is a unique and versatile worldwide resource of critical reagents not otherwise readily available for the HIV/AIDS research community.  In 2002, the ARP contract was amended to provide reagents for other infectious diseases.  In addition to HIV/AIDS reagents, the ARP is currently also providing reagents for hepatitis C virus, anthrax and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus research.  The ARP acquires state-of-the-art reagents, authenticates and produces these reagents, standardized panels, and protocols; and then provides these reagents for the cost of shipping to qualified investigators throughout the world.  The ARP collects information about reagents and standards and disseminates this information through print, World Wide Web, and wet workshops. Additionally, the ARP enhances technology transfer through development and publication of methods, facilitates commercial development of reagents through proactive communication with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and participates as an AIDS Collaborating Center of the World Health Organization-UNAIDS, and United Kingdom’s NIBSC Centralized Facility for AIDS Reagents. During the past year, the ARP has provided over 3,000 shipments of 14,000 reagents to investigators in 66 countries. Successful operation, management and coordination of the ARP requires: (1) knowledge, experience and demonstrated competence in: (a) identification, prioritization, acquisition, and validation of reagents from domestic and international sources; and (b) reagent production, quality control, and storage;  (2) knowledge, experience and competence in packaging/shipping biohazardous and etiologic agents to domestic and international sites; and procuring the appropriate import/export licenses, permits and certifications required by local, State and Federal authorities for handling  reagents; (3) available staff with technical and managerial experience to coordinate effectively operation of the ARP through interaction with the AIDS research community including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, technology transfer officials worldwide, and NIAID; (4) information technology experience in maintaining and updating information on: (a) World Wide Web including a catalog of reagents and  updates ; and (b) a secure database system to track all information that relates to the activities of the ARP, including an inventory of reagents, registration and ordering of reagents by investigators, shipment and receiving of reagents, assay information and quality control; (5) personnel with documented experience in operating an organization of comparable size and complexity to the ARP; (6) ability to work with the incumbent Contractor to safely and efficiently transfer operation of the current ARP to a new location. (7) a Principal Investigator who has the equivalent of a Ph.D. and postdoctoral research experience in biological sciences in order to identify critical reagents for HIV/AIDS and to provide expert technical assistance to the NIAID; (8) staff with writing and editorial experience to prepare a catalogue, newsletter and promotional literature; and (9) availability of adequate facilities, equipment and resources necessary to operate, maintain and expand the ARP; facilities to receive and store hazardous and infectious agents  and maintain their activity and viability; compliance with all standards of safety, guidelines, policies and regulations, including training and monitoring of personnel for exposure to infectious and hazardous reagents. The contractor must have an existing GMP facility and current licenses, permits to work with biohazardous and infectious agents including radioactive materials; and the capacity, capability, and experience to work with NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogens and emerging infectious disease agents (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm; http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Agentlist.asp. The contractor will not be engaged in any activities involving Category A Pathogens that require handling under Biosafety Level (BSL-4) safety and containment conditions http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/pdffiles/4th%20BMBL.pdf  Personnel assigned to this project must be bonded and meet all local, state and Federal Regulations and registrations for access and handling licensing requirements for CDC Category A-C Agents.  This includes the requirements of the Patriot Act http://uscis.gov/graphics/lawsregs/patriot.pdf).  and current and valid registration for access to and possession of  to Select Agents  http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/ (Appendix A to 42 CFR Part 73, http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/42cfr73.pdf and  http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/42cfr73a.pdf;   7 CFR Part 331 and 9 CFR Part 121   http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ncie/pdf/btarule.pdf  and  http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ncie/pdf/agri_bioterrorism.pdf).    It will be necessary to maintain a high degree of physical and electronic security for the ARP including computer systems.  The contractor must keep current with any changes in Select Agent Registration requirements that may be adopted by the U.S. Government.  Some Government furnished property will be available for transfer under the current contract (a liquid nitrogen freezer, radiation counter and computer software).  Site visits may be required to determine the adequacy of the facilities and resources.  While subcontracting is permitted, reagent acquisition, storage, distribution and management of ARP should be performed by the Prime contractor. The Government needs to have direct oversight of the contract in order to ensure quality control and safe handling and distribution of reagents, many of which are biohazardous and infectious. Currently, the ARP has approximately 300,000 samples of reagents stored at 24 degrees C, at -88 degrees C, at 20 degrees C, at -40 degrees C,  -80 degrees C, and at liquid nitrogen conditions. The number of reagents is expected to reach approximately 800,000 during the life of the new contract and 1200 reagents will be shipped monthly, involving approximately 275-300 shipments, of which 15% may be to overseas locations in industrialized and developing countries. Approximately 50-75 incoming shipments of reagents per month will be received. The offeror must have storage space for approximately 500 cubic feet at low temperatures as well as adequate capacity for retrieving, aliquoting and shipping large numbers of reagents per month. It is anticipated that the period of performance for this contract will be a total of seven years. A cost reimbursement contract is expected to be awarded in fiscal 2005 with an estimated level of effort of 16,640 total labor hours.  Interested Small and Minority Business organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  See Numbered Note 25.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.
