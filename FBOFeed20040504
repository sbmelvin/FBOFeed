<DESC>RFP:  306-04-516 Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Afghanistan Transportation Infrastructure, Phase II. 

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will conduct a full and open competition to select a Contractor to implement Phase II of the transport sector element of its Afghanistan infrastructure construction and rehabilitation program. The focus of the transport sector contract to be awarded through this solicitation will be on primary, secondary and tertiary roads.  The contract may also include airport and other transportation infrastructure as well.  Additionally, the transport sector contract will have institutional capacity building, heavy equipment repair, operations and maintenance components, including training.  

Competition for the contract will be open to organizations of any nationality included in ìAuthorized Geographic Codeî 935.  Presently, Code 935 includes all countries except for Cuba, Iran, Laos, Libya, North Korea and Syria.  This solicitation and award selection will utilize the competitive methodology of U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15: Contracting by Negotiation; reference www.arnet.gov/far.  

This pre-solicitation notice is issued on www.fedbizopps.gov for the purpose of alerting interested parties of the upcoming competitive contract opportunity.  The solicitation document, a Request for Proposal (RFP), will be issued on the same website along with this notice and will contain the work statement, anticipated contract terms, proposal evaluation factors, and instructions to organizations interested in submitting a proposal.  The proposal due date identified in this notice is approximate.  The RFP will specify the actual proposal due date which will be at least 30 calendar days after the RFP is posted on www.fedbizopps.gov.  To locate USAID acquisitions on that website, sign on as a ìVendorî, select our agency acronym ìAIDî, and search via the options indicated.  For instance, this acquisition is listed under the overseas mission location of Afghanistan.   

The RFP will include as an attachment, a list of firms that have expressed interest.  If your organization wishes to be included in the list, please send an e-mail request to the USAID contracting officer: cmallay@usaid.gov.    
  
Additional Information:  A Requirements-type of task order contract is planned where, as each project is identified, work will be authorized and funded via a negotiated task order issued under the contract.   The transport sector contract is expected to have an ordering period, including options, of 3-5 years and is expected to cover all activities required to construct and rehabilitate transportation sector infrastructure including as-found condition assessments, actual and projected traffic analysis, general design, cost estimating, preparation of technical specification and bid documents, and sub-contracting out and supervision of the implementation of approved projects in accordance with the contract, including appropriate flow-down of U.S. Federal and USAID contract clauses.  In subcontracting out the implementation of approved projects, preference will be given to Afghanistan firms and the use of Afghanistan labor.

This RFP will be one of three that together will comprise Phase II of USAID infrastructure rehabilitation and construction efforts in Afghanistan.  The other two RFPs and contracts are expected to be similar in general type and methodology, but will be managed separately and will cover two different sectors.  One of these will be an RFP for a contract having as its primary focus the construction and refurbishment of public buildings such as schools, clinics, hospitals, national and provincial government offices, and universities.  The other RFP will be for a contract having as its primary focus energy and water related infrastructure including power generation plants, power transmission and distribution systems, dams, reservoirs and canals.  The pre-solicitation notices for the public building sector and combined energy/water sector will be separately published in www.FedBizOpps.gov and that is expected to occur in May 2004 or as soon as possible thereafter.  Each of the three primary contracts (transport, public buildings, energy/water) will likely include the other two areas as secondary areas of responsibility if and when required by USAID on a project-by-project basis and under circumstances to be suggested in the RFP and described in the contract.     

The USAID/Pakistan contract office will issue the RFP that is the subject of this notice and will be responsible for all pre-award activities.  Upon award of the contract, the principle contracting office for the contract will be USAID/Afghanistan.

<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing its plans for the acquisition of Security Guard Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these Security Guard Services will require the contractor to procure armed guard services which provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, information, facilities, United States government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage, and terrorism.  Requirements are further defined in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The current version of the SOW is provided as a separate document under this announcement. Services will be performed at the MMAC.  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page. This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options. The procurement action resulting from this Announcement/SIR1 is contemplated as a set-aside for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA‚Äôs 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) vendors that are certified under the SBA in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this Announcement/SIR1.  However, the FAA reserves the right to allow SEDBs from other areas to be considered in the event a sufficient number of SEDBs fail to meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR1.  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services - $10.5/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA within Area VI an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor‚Äôs eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor‚Äôs eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor‚Äôs information.  Any statement included in a vendor‚Äôs response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 8 pages (8-1/2‚Äùx11‚Äù, printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor‚Äôs response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor‚Äôs submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor‚Äôs eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an ‚Äúacceptable/unacceptable‚Äù basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 1.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents ‚Äúhow well‚Äù an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has ‚Äúdone it.‚Äù  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have five years experience in performing security guard services as identified in the attached SOW.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendor‚Äôs documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor‚Äôs performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 75 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, etc. Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to: Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center NAS Contracting Division Attn:  AMQ-210/Phyllis Townsley Room 321, Multi-Purpose Building 6500 South MacArthur Blvd. P.O.

If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor‚Äôs response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. AMS Clause, 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting, AMS Provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, and AMS Provision 3.9.1-3, PROTEST, are applicable to this SIR.

<ARCHDATE>05142005
<CONTACT>Larry  Jackel, Program Manager, IPTO, Phone xxx xxx-xxxx, Fax 703 696-4534, Email xxx@xxx.xxx
<DESC>Learning Applied to Ground Robots (LAGR) BAA04-25.  The Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for a two-phase program. The LAGR program is pursuing development and demonstration of a new generation of learned perception and control algorithms for autonomous ground vehicles.  In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the LAGR Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm for further information. The LAGR PIP contains additional details regarding the Program Objectives, Program Description, Test and Evaluation, Program Scope, General Information, Submission Process, Reporting Requirements and Procedures, Proposal Format, Evaluation and Funding Processes, and Administrative Addresses.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA. The envisioned outcome of the LAGR program is a revolutionary methodology for developing autonomous navigation software systems. Current systems typically rely on hand-crafted, hand-tuned algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance.  In LAGR, algorithms will be created that learn how to navigate based on their own experience and by mimicking human teleoperation.  It is expected that systems developed in LAGR will provide a performance breakthrough in navigation through complex terrain.

Phase I is an 18-month effort to develop learning methods that enable learned navigation systems for autonomous travel through outdoor terrain. Performer teams will receive a baseline system as Government Furnished Equipment, consisting of a mobile base, a state-of-the-art system for autonomous navigation including sensing, computing, and software, with total weight less than 200 pounds.  On an approximately monthly basis beginning approximately three months into the period of performance, performer teams will upload their software to a central facility.  There, a staff of independent DARPA-designated operators will download the code into a functionally identical vehicle system, and run it.  The criteria for Phase I is for the learned system to travel ten percent faster than the baseline system, driving the same vehicle on the same course under the same conditions.  Phase II is an 18-month effort whose objectives are to (a) continue development of learning methods promising revolutionary advances, and (b) port successful methods to a high-mobility vehicle named Spinner weighing several tons.  The criteria for Phase II are (a) for the learned system to travel twice as fast as the baseline system, again driving the same vehicle on the same course under the same conditions, and (b) for the learned system to enable Spinner to drive autonomously.  Offerors are directed to Section 2, Program Description, of the PIP for further information. 

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. 

II. Award Information 
The Government anticipates multiple awards ranging from $1.5M to $2M. Phase II funding will be based on achieving the Milestone 1 criteria. The Offeror is expected to provide a realistic technical and cost proposal for best achieving the program objectives within the outlined budget and schedule.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in LAGR technology. 
Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Section II, I. of the proposal, organized by task and year.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement contains all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [NOTE:  See paragraph 6, ìOther Submission Requirements,î for reference to the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
The Offeror may propose to only Phase I, or Phases I and II.  The Offeror wishing to participate in Phase II should include it as an option in their proposal.  In addition, the Offeror may submit only one proposal. The Offeror's proposal should consist of a Cover Page, Volume 1 Technical Proposal, and Volume 2 Cost Proposal.  The Offeror should refer to Section 8, Proposal Format, of the PIP for guidance on how to structure and format their proposal. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL:

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET), June 17, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 04-25, Learning Applied to Ground Robots (LAGR) will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) Friday, April 29, 2005. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, April 29, 2005. While the proposals submitted after the June 17, 2004, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.

4.  Intergovernmental Review ñ N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered  in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Proposers must obtain the BAA 04-25  Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-25  PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information

1.  Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims.  Evaluation will also consider the effectiveness of the system integration and management plan.
 (2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Offerors should apply new and/or existing technology in an innovative way that supports the objectives of the proposed effort.   The proposed concepts and systems should show breadth of innovation across all the dimensions of the proposed solution.  Offerors must also specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics for measuring progress of the effort.
 (3)	Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission:  The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to DARPA/IPTO.  
(4)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.
 (5)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition:  The offeror should provide a clear strategy and plan for transition to military forces (and commercial sector, where applicable).  Offerors should consider involving potential military transition partners, as appropriate, in any proposed experiments, tests and demonstrations.  Offerors should also provide a plan for transition of appropriate technology components and information to the user community.
 (6)	Cost Realism:  The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.
2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Governmentís technical and policy goals.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as ìGovernment Only.î   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).

These forms and forms-filling software are available through the General Services Administration forms library at the following website:  http://www/gsa.gov/.  The following criteria will apply in evaluating proposals:

Past Performance
1. Past performance will receive 100 percent of the non- cost/price factors ratings.  Subfactors A, B, and C are of approximately equal importance. 
A. Quality of Product or Service ñ Quality is defined as the demonstrated ability to meet contract specifications and conformance to standards.  
B. Timeliness of Performance ñ Ability to meet the contract time frames or deadlines
C. Business Relations ñ Business relations are defined as effectiveness of management working relationships and cooperative behavior, such as ability to resolve questions or conflicts between contractor and others.

It will include a determination of the offerors commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 
4. Award may be made from the initial offers without discussions.  However, if discussions are held offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to review the rating.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

6. Basis for Award:  The successful offeror will be that offeror that offers the best overall value for past performance and price considerations.  The best price does not mean the lowest price.

Past Performance Information
A. Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their proposal for both the offeror and proposed major subcontractors:

NOTE:  It is incumbent upon Offerors to provide their past performance information clearly, completely, and concisely.  Providing incomplete past performance evaluation information may result in an Offerors being determined nonresponsive and therefore ineligible for further consideration in the source selection process.

<DESC>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is undertaking the redesign of a system that supports the evaluation of the impact of student loans on the United States budget. The current system, which has been developed over a period in excess of 10 years, is run in a Lotus 4.01 spreadsheet environment. The series of spreadsheets models the revenue impact of student loans by allowing the user to vary assumptions regarding funding and student repayment behavior. The spreadsheet takes, as input, data supplied by the Department of Education which is then manually entered by the user. The system makes extensive use of very sophisticated macros. After some investigation, CBO has concluded that it is not feasible, nor in the best interest of the agency, to import the spreadsheet to a more recent version of Lotus or Excel because some macro functions behave in significantly different ways in later versions. 
The overall project objective is to obtain a system with capabilities at least equivalent to the existing Lotus spreadsheet system, that does not rely on proprietary third-party software and can be maintained by in-house IT support staff once it is fully deployed. Specific CBO project objectives include: (1) Simple English language specification of system functional and technical requirements. (2) Recommendations regarding the technology to be used to support the new system. CBO will entertain a wide variety of technology options including one or a combination of the following: MS Access, Visual Basic, MS Excel, ColdFusion, and MS SQL Server. (3) A tested and working application. 
The contractor shall supply business process and computer software analysis and design skills as part of an overall system development effort. The contractor must be able to demonstrate: (1) Broad and deep (expert level) knowledge of relational technology and Structured Query Language or SQL (to include database design and implementation). (2) Extensive knowledge of structured software development approaches, and understand the advantages and limitations of such approaches. (3) Experience with at least three of the five technology options outlined under project objectives. 
This contract is a time-and-materials and indefinite-delivery indefinite quantity type contract: the Assessment portion of the requirement will be conducted as time-and-materials, and the Conversion portion will be a firm fixed-price task order. Upon contract award, the Contractor shall perform an assessment of the existing system and submit a report providing the determination of the best approach to convert the spreadsheet to a new system. Upon negotiation of a fixed price for the conversion activities, a task order will be issued for that portion of the work. The Assessment report is due no later than August 31, 2004. All work under the contract will be completed by the end of December 31, 2004. 
The Request for Proposals (RFP) is being issued concurrent with this synopsis. See accompanying file(s) for the complete solicitation document and example spreadsheets. Offerors are asked to submit a technical and cost proposal, which will be evaluated utilizing negotiation procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process. Offers will be evaluated on the following factors: (1) Offerorís technical approach to the work; (2) Offerorís experience with and past performance on similar projects from the past 3 years; and (3) Price. The due date for proposals is May 21, 2004. A pre-proposal Q&A demonstration session will be held on May 12, 2004 at the CBO offices in Washington, DC. Attendance at the demonstration is not mandatory, but highly recommended.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates the award of a contract for two years to achieve two major program goals.   First, the program will increase the use of and access to quality child health and reproductive health and services, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, and improve the health of women and children.  The program will build the capacity of NGOs working in Haiti to provide quality health services through the application of best practices and lessons learned during past project implementation.  The program will support decentralization of public sector services and management, as well as public-private partnership for improved services.   The second major element of the contract will contribute directly to the Presidentís Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Goal set in Haiti to provide treatment to 25,000 people, prevent 125,000 new HIV infections and to provide care and support services to 125,000 people with a particular focus on orphans and vulnerable children by 2008.  The HIV response in Haiti will focus on comprehensive programs for prevention, care and treatment, building on the substantial network of NGOs and community-based organizations, as well as existing clinic-based care and treatment programs in the country.   The contractor shall be required to work in close collaboration with all U.S. Government partners in achieving these goals.   All activities proposed shall also have to directly contribute to PEPFAR goals.    Please note that this RFP is for services in Haiti and not the Dominican Republic.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP) Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) intends to award follow-on work to PA Consulting of Washington, DC using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain an interim version of a forecasting model that EPA uses to evaluate the impact of potential air emissions control policies. Under the initial Purchase Order, the Contractor provided expert technical support on the coal supply curves which will  be used in version 2.2 of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). Due to regulatory deadlines, EPA will issue an interim IPM update, which will require adaptation of the Contractor's previously performed work so that it can be incorporated into this interim version of the model.  The North American  Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620. It has been determined that because of the ability of PA Consulting to continue to provide coal experts with a working knowledge of the IPM model and its use of coal supply curves not found among other vendors, it the only  vendor uniquely qualified to satisfy this requirement.

<DESC>This is a draft RFI being posted to alert industry to a solicitation that will be issued in the future and to obtain comment from industry on a draft of the performance work statement intended to be used for the procurement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The U.S. Department of State intends to procure Humanitarian Mine Action and Small Arms/Light Weapons Removal or Destruction Services to plan, organize, train, deploy and operate contractor mine action or small arms/light weapons work parties to locate, destroy or remove mines, small arms and light weapons.  All logistic support for the work parties may be required by the task order.  In certain circumstances contractors may be required to recruit, evaluate, train and deploy local/third-country foreign nationals for mine action or small arms/light weapons destruction or removal operations overseas.  A SECRET facility clearance will be required prior to award of a contract.  A DRAFT copy of the performance based Statement of Work is attached to this synopsis.  The Department anticipates tmultiple wo or three IDIQ awards with task orders competed between the awardees.  It is anticipated that the task orders will be a combination of firm- fixed price and cost- reimbursement.  It is anticipated that A at least one yet to be determined task order will be competed at time of contract award.  Contract type is based on the belief that while the work being performed is risky, the business proposal is not.  The RFP is not complete but a draft of the performance work statement (PWS) is enclosed for comment.  A Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (developed by and implemented by the Government) and incentive plan as appearing  have not been written yet and we welcome comments from industry in these areas.  ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  In accordance with FAR 15.201, this DRAFT RFI is an "exchange with industry before receipt of proposals".  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  There is no FAR requirement for a reply to the questions or comments received from posting a draft PWS.  The Department may choose to answer the questions received but there is no duty to do so.  The Draft PWS may be amended based on feedback provided by industry or further US Government internal review, if warranted. The final PWS will be incorporated into and issued as part of an RFP on or about June 11, 2004.  If industry wants a copy of that solicitation, requests must be submitted in writing.  This requirement will not be reannounced unless this requirement is substantially changed.  It is anticipated that there will be a down-select based on technical experience on contracts of similar size with those most qualified providing full proposals, including oral proposals, with pricing on at least one task order that may be awarded without further discussions.  The closing date for the receipt of offers will be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.  Questions or comments on our anticipated methods and on the draft PWS should be submitted by email only to Yun Frank (FrankYH@state.gov), no later than May 24, 2004.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE RETURNED.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) ñ Orlando, TSD intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) commercial contract to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) on a sole source basis.  The Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) has directed NAVAIR Orlando to incorporate additional capability into the Surface Warfare Officer School ñ Ship Handling Trainer (SWOS-SHT) suite currently being utilized at SWOS in Newport, RI.  Specifically, Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) will be tasked to develop a Full Mission Bridge Trainer module and to integrate this module with the twelve existing desktop systems to create an interactive, total team training environment for ship bridge crews.  This tasking will also include the option to purchase twelve additional desktop systems and a scenario replay lab for future integration into the SWOS-SHT suite.  Additionally, this tasking requires extensive software modifications to incorporate the Anti-terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) functionality required by SWOS.  These modifications will provide the SWOS-SHT suite with additional scenarios and capabilities to train the ship bridge crews on how to recognize and defend against terrorist threats.   This total effort will require software modifications and additional hardware.  The existing baseline software is a proprietary product and is considered to be a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product sold under the V-Ship product line.  Incorporation of the ATFP functionality requires extensive modification of this proprietary baseline.  Additional spares will be required.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  For questions or comments regarding this notice, please contact the referenced specialists.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>BAA04-12, Addendum 5 Special Focus Area: Protein Design Processes. Email: baa04-12@darpa.mil; DUE: September 17, 2004. The Defense Sciences Office is soliciting innovative research ideas in response to two technically challenging protein design problems: 1) creating the ability to make enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions not performed by natural enzymes for the synthesis of chemicals of interest to the Department of Defense demonstrated by designing a protein that catalyzes the regio- and chemo-specific nitration of phenol; 2) creating the ability to rapidly (hours as opposed to weeks or months) make new proteins that inactivate new biological pathogens or toxins demonstrated by designing, in less than one day, a protein that will specifically inactivate human influenza virus.  The problems were chosen because: a) they are of interest to the DoD and national security; and, b) they require the creation of new and revolutionary computational and experimental tools whose development requires a concerted effort by an interdisciplinary team of scientists drawn from the fields of chemistry, math, physics and biology.  Other protein design problems that are equivalent to or exceed the challenges posed here and that share the same critical features cited above would also be of interest to DARPA. This announcement is a call for proposals describing research that will radically change the way protein design is now practiced.  Therefore, successful proposals will have to clearly identify the fundamental scientific and technical issues now faced by the protein design community and describe innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to overcoming current scientific and technical barriers that limit rapid protein design. It is expected that this research will be conducted in phases, with definitive near-, mid- and far-term milestones proposed over a 4-5 year period in order to provide measurable metrics for monitoring success toward this revolutionary and pervasive technology for designing functional proteins. Because of the complicated nature of this research, the submission of a white paper (pre-proposal) is STRONGLY recommended.  The following sections provide background information about the research topic as well as detailed instructions for submitting white papers and proposals to the Protein Design Program. Background. Mature materials and sensor engineering technologies have emerged from fundamental knowledge in materials science, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.  A critical factor limiting the maturation of biotechnology into a robust engineering discipline that can reliably design and manufacture biomaterials, biosensors and bioprocesses in support of DoD is the primitive state of computational tools for bioengineering in comparison to, say, electrical or mechanical engineering.  A major barrier to developing practical computational tools for bioengineering is the inherent complexity of biological materials and systems.  The creation of a robust, bottom-up (e.g., Current Opinion in Structural Biology. 13:490, 2003) protein engineering process would have a pervasive impact on biotechnology that would enable and accelerate the development of many new DoD applications (e.g., catalysts that enhance warfighter performance [nutrition, wakefulness], biosensors, underwater adhesives, biomotors) as well as many unanticipated technologies. A typical soluble protein might contain 20 different amino acid subunits in a 300 subunit-long sequence.  Each amino acid contains 4-5 different elements (C, O, N, H and sometimes S).  The smallest amino acid, glycine, has 10 atoms (MW=75), while the largest, tryptophan, has 23 atoms (MW=204).  A typical 300 subunit-long protein thus contains thousands of atoms in a compact structure whose spatial extent is on the order of 10 nm on a side.  Although our ability to accurately predict the structure of a protein with atomic resolution given only an amino acid sequence is steadily improving (PROTEINS: 23(5), 1995; Supplement 1, 1997; Supplement 3, 1999; Supplement 5, 2001; Supplement 6, 2003), we are interested in the inverse problem: specifying the amino acid sequences that will generate a desired and functional structure.  Solutions to the inverse problem are currently not feasible and might even be NP-hard (Protein Engineering 15:779, 2002). Current approaches to protein design (Journal of Structural Biology 134:269, 2001) primarily involve either top-down approaches via the modification of known protein frameworks (Nature 423:185, 2003) or are limited to the design of protein scaffolds with hydrophobic cores and fixed backbones (Science 282:1462, 1998; Science 302:1364; 2003).  If we are to design functional proteins of the kind specified by the challenge problems posed here, dramatic advances will need to be made in research areas that include, but are not limited to: optimization methods for searching through sequence and structure space; energy functions that are sensitive to local atomic structure and that explicitly handle van der Waals, solvation, electrostatics, and hydrogen bonding interactions;  the incorporation of backbone flexibility and functional groups into protein design algorithms (this will be particularly important for enzyme design as one must design stable structures that are capable of substrate binding, catalysis and product release); use of knowledge-based and informatics approaches to represent and use secondary-structures and folds as composable elements; and loop or turn classification. We believe that major technical improvements in these and other research areas that contribute to protein design will emerge only through the concerted efforts of highly interdisciplinary research teams drawing on state-of-the-art capabilities in mathematics (e.g. geometry, topology, signal processing), physics (e.g., solid state, quantum mechanics), chemistry (e.g., chemical reaction pathways, chemical structure analysis),  and biology (e.g., novel informatics-based approaches to protein structure classification). White Paper and Proposal Information. In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged (but are not required) to submit white papers (pre-proposals) in advance of full proposals.  White Paper Instructions. Please put the phrase Protein Design Process in the title of the white paper. White papers may address any combination of the research areas discussed above but those with a sole emphasis on informatics-based techniques are strongly discouraged. While DARPA does not participate or provide direction in the formation of research teams, in order to facilitate teaming opportunities for interdisciplinary work, DARPA is sponsoring a Teaming Website at the following URL: http://pdp.walcoff.com.  Investigators can use this site to make others aware of their own capabilities and to identify capabilities they seek in potential teammates. The web site will also provide answers to frequently posed questions regarding the solicitation. White papers, not to exceed 8 pages, must provide the following information: 1.A clear statement of the uniqueness of the idea in response to the challenge problem(s) and in the context of the existing state-of-the-art in protein design.  If you choose a challenge problem (or problems) other than the ones in this addendum, you must explain why you believe: a) it is equivalent to or exceeds the challenges posed here; b) it is of interest to DoD; and, c) it requires development of new and revolutionary computational and experimental tools whose development requires a concerted effort by an interdisciplinary team of scientists drawn from the fields of chemistry, math, physics and biology.  We are looking for ideas that will generate revolutionary capabilities if the proposed work is completed successfully over a 5 year period of performance. While distinct goals that target the challenge problem must be identified, the scope of the idea and approach may extend past the 5 year performance period; 2. A concise statement of the scientific and technical challenges, unique approaches, and potential anticipated technical solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This statement should demonstrate that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art; 3. Explicit timelines and milestone achievements by which progress toward the goals can be evaluated.  These milestones should reflect an initial period of performance of 24 months with subsequent milestones reflecting 12 month periods of performance.  Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics of performance; 4.A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding;5. A management plan that describes how the different disciplines represented on the team will be harnessed to demonstrate a solution to the challenge problem(s);
6. A brief summary of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members. White Paper Deadline and Submission Information. If white papers are received by 1600 EST, Friday, July 16, 2004, DARPA will provide a recommendation to submit or not to submit full proposals by Friday, August 20, 2004.  Preproposals received after July16, 2004 may not be reviewed under this addendum. If the authors of white papers choose not to submit electronically, U.S. mail may be used. White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions. To facilitate the submission of white papers, a website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been set up. For more detailed instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to the instructions for BAA04-12 found at the website http://www.darpa.mil/dso. Format and Content of Full Proposals. Follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at: http://www.darpa.mil/dso.  Additional guidelines specific to this addendum are provided below. Please put the phrase Protein Design Process in the title of the proposal. Notwithstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum. Each full proposal should, in addition: 1.Elaborate on the specific information requested in the instructions for white papers by providing sufficient technical details so as to permit complete evaluation of the feasibility of the idea; 2. Include at least two specific and quantitative technical achievements to be demonstrated at 24, 48 and 60 months.  These achievements should permit the evaluation of progress towards solving the challenge problem(s). Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 EST, Friday, September 17, 2004, to the address shown below. Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update to the DHS SPIRIT project and a pre-solicitation notice to announce the anticipated release date of the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  1) All comments on the Draft RFP have been adjudicated and have been considered for inclusion in the final RFP.  As stated in a previous FedBizOpps notice, we are not issuing responses to the consolidated comments; however, a few significant changes have been made to the DHS SPIRIT requirement as a result.  a) Offerors are no longer required to submit unburdened labor rates.  The considerable number of comments received on the required submission of unburdened labor rates for the offeror, subcontractors, and teaming partners caused this issue to be reviewed.  It was determined that the secure submission of this proprietary data presented difficulties that outweighed the benefits of having this data.  b) Offerors may submit letters from Federal agencies other than the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) as written certification of an approved cost accounting system.  It was determined that, in addition to letters from DCMA and DCAA, letters from other Federal government agencies on agency letterhead indicating that the offeror has a currently acceptable accounting system with the approval date referenced in the letter, are acceptable.  c) There are minor changes to the core labor categories due to industry input.  As a result, there are additions to Functional Areas 2 and 3.  The revised core labor categories are provided as an attachment.  d) There are changes to the maximum level of core labor categories ñ the maximum level is reduced from ten to five.  Offerors are still required to propose a minimum of three levels per labor category.  e) Issues regarding the function of the Contractor Program Manager (CPM) have been clarified and this person is no longer considered a ìkeyî person for the contract.  That is, the person is not expected to be a full time position and should be charged to the appropriate overhead pool.  e) The Homeland Security Information Technology Security Program Publication, DHS MD 4300.Pub., Volume I, Policy Guide, Part A, Sensitive Systems, referenced in HSAR 3052.204-70 (in Section H.25 of the draft RFP), is provided as an attachment.  2) Information regarding the final RFP release is as follows: RFP release is anticipated on May 18, 2004.  Questions from industry on the final RFP are anticipated to be due June 2, 2004 with proposals anticipated to be due July 13, 2004.   3) NAICS Codes for this requirement remain 541511, 541512, 541513 and 541519 with a $21M size standard for all.   NOTE:  Due to overwhelming interest in this requirement, no phone inquiries, e-mails or requests to meet ìone-on-oneî will be answered.  Please ensure you are utilizing the FedBizOpps auto-notification feature to receive all updates to this effort.

<DESC>The posting amends an earlier synopsis entitled ìCommunity Outreach Tuskegee Syphilis Studyî which was posted on April 20, 2004, as a potential sole source action to the Tuskegee Human and  Civil Rights Multicultural Center, Tuskegee, Alabama.   

The following information is being provided to better describe the specific tasks associated with this project in an effort to assist alternative sources in determining whether they possess the qualifications to perform the work.  

Much has been written, reported, and documented about the now infamous study, ìThe Tuskegee Syphilis Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male,î which was conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service from 1932-1972. The Syphilis Study Website, currently available on-line at www.tuskegeemcc.org, was the THCRMCCís initial effort at overcoming a lack of public awareness of the program by including archival material from the study.  However, a website alone, without effective outreach and awareness programs, is unlikely to achieve two vital objectives:   to disseminate widely the facts and lessons to be learned from these events and to highlight the ongoing problem of syphilis in current society.  The Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Multicultural Center can meet these objectives by providing target audiences with the capability of using electronic media to view the Center.  This action will stimulate interest in the target audience, facilitate questions and promote interest in visiting the Center.   Where a capability does not exist to view the virtual tour or other material on the Internet, interested parties may request an exportable educational package for use in a formal or informal setting.   Both of these activities will facilitate awareness not only of the original 1932 study, but also of the current hazards of syphilis in our society and in turn, enhance and improve the state of medical research and the health of citizens.   The intent of the current project is to continue efforts of the Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Multicultural Center to preserve the history and lessons of the U.S. Public Health Serviceís Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the Negro male (1932 ñ 1972).  Under this Statement of Work,  CDC will seek to broaden public awareness of the Center and its programs, the syphilis study itself, and the ongoing problem of syphilis  The existing website will be expanded and the associated information system hardware and software updated and maintained as necessary.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau anticipates issuing a competitive solicitation in the first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2005 to acquire an Integrated Dissemination System (IDS) system that will serve as a single point for public access to all Census data (current and future) and data products. The primary goal(s) of this new IDS is to establish a single web information portal that will integrate the many diverse dissemination functions currently spread across multiple Census Bureau organizations and to provide the Census Bureau's continually expanding customer community with effective analytical capabilities and one-stop access to existing and new Census data resources. The Census Bureau expects to award this contract in the fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2005.  Information on this acquisition will be posted on the IDS web site at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html.
  
In preparation for this acquisition, the U.S. Census Bureau will host an Industry Day in Federal Building 3, Morris Hansen Auditorium, 4700 Silver Hill Road, Suitland, MD, 20476, from 1200-1500, Friday, May 21, 2004.  The purpose of Industry Day is to begin dialog with the vendor community concerning this important Census Bureau initiative. The Government will provide information outlining the vision and goals of the new IDS, present a program overview, address the acquisition approach and timeline, and describe current Census Bureau data dissemination challenges.  Government program and contract personnel will be available to respond to questions about the program and the planned acquisition.

<DESC>Market survey for standardized ladder climbing devices.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, is conducting a market survey to identify sources and to increase competition acquisition opportunities for Standardized Ladder Climbing Devic es.  This request is only a market survey, not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  It is for information only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or announcement of a solicitation.  The purpose of this Sources Sought request is to o btain information on ladder climbing devices offering full compatibility and interoperability with existing fall arrest systems at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN.  In the interest of safety and efficiency, AEDC is standardizin g the ladder safety climb devices used throughout the installation.   New ladder climbing devices shall be fully (100%) compatible with the existing base-wide for AEDC, which is Saf-T-Climb manufactured by North Safety Products, and shall also comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1926.501, 29 CFR 1926.502, and ANSI A14.3.  The components of these fall arrest or ladder climb devices consist of several key components which must work together.   A carrier rail is installed permanently to the ladder and a removable sleeve w ith locking device slides up or down the rail. The worker attaches their harness to the sleeve and any slip or fall is stopped by the locking action of the sleeve and locking device. Since the sleeve is removable it is protected from weather and can be ins pected along with the fall protection harness. Should the worker fall, rescue is much simpler because the worker is already equipped with a harness.  The sleeve must be fully compatible with the rail or the system will not work. Standardization with one fu lly compatible system has great advantage. It provides reduced needs for training because only one system is being used; there is only one method for use and one inspection requirement. There is greater confidence among workers because they can practice an d train on the system they are going to use. Standardization results in reduced inventory, every sleeve fits every rail, and greater accessibility thereby ensuring greater use by our workers.   Responses are required fourteen (14) days after publication of  this notice.  Responses should be addressed to:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN:  CESAM-CT-C, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL  36628-0001 and will be directed to Mrs. Michelle Stracener, (251) 694-3865, facsimile (251) 441-6510.  Firms interested in  being considered shall provide manufacturer√¢¬Ä¬ôs name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include necessary backup information and support documentation.  The Government will not pay for an y material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>NASA Kennedy Space Center is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of seeking sources and soliciting information from private industry on an Improved Chemical Protective Ensemble (ICPE), boots and gloves;  or individual ICPE components.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. Product information submitted will not be returned.  Interested sources shall include information regarding the firmís background/experience.  Respondents shall not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.  Materials used for the suit fabric, gloves and boots shall be described as complete as possible.  This RFI is seeking commercial-off-the-shelf or non-developmental technologies for evaluation. The ICPE will be worn in Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health toxic environments of Hydrazine, Monomethylhydrazine, Dimethylhydrazine, Aerozineñ50 and Nitrogen Tetroxide.  The current chemical protective ensemble used for the Kennedy Space Center / Cape Canaveral Air Force Station operations is made from Chlorobutyl Rubber/NomexÆ fabric, has a front entry, incorporates aluminum quick disconnects for the boots and gloves, and weighs approximately 26 pounds. Vaporized air is supplied from a cryogenic breathing air system (back pack) carried on the wearerís back.  The air is distributed to the suit arms, legs, and hood area through a manifold system, unlike a Level A suit where the air is supplied to a SCBA mask.  The visor is PVC or Plexiglas G. For the purpose of this survey, NFPA 1991 Standard on Vapor-Protective Ensembles for Hazardous Emergencies 2000 Edition shall be used as a basis for responding to this request.  GENERAL REQUIREMENT The ICPE shall be manufactured using materials which are compatible, impermeable, flexible, anti-static (electrostatic discharge characteristic), puncture and tear resistant, and flame resistant. The suit fabric shall be white or near white in color and contain a readily identifiable wear indicator layer.  The ICPE shall completely encapsulate the wearerís torso and breathing air system.  The ensemble shall use soft cuff interfaces for the boots and gloves.  The ICPE shall have an expanded back for the current breathing air system.	 The visor shall be compatible with the toxic environments listed, and be scratch and impact resistant. The PVC and Plexiglas visor materials will not be considered.  The exhaust/relief valve design shall prevent a reverse flow of ambient atmosphere into the suit at all times, including when the wearer bends over or assumes a squatting position (thereby expelling a large volume of air) and then rapidly stands up (the volume of the ensemble is rapidly increased). This kind of movement produces a lower interior suit pressure than the ambient air and accounts for the reverse flow. The operational time of the present ensemble is 2 hours.  The ensemble shall be capable of being decontaminated and reused for a minimum of 40 wearings.  As a goal the ensemble shall be easy to don and doff, have good  mobility and dexterity capabilities, be light in weight, and be economical. The mobility and dexterity goal is related to fabric weight and suit design.  Responses to this RFI should reference RFI04-KKN-ICPE and shall include the following information:  1.  Company name, address, POC name, phone number, fax number and email.  2.  Contractor and Government Entity (COGE Code).  3.  Size of business ñ Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantage, 8(a), Hubzone, Woman-Owned and/or Veteran-Owned.  4.  Respondents ability to meet the above criteria. 5.  Any other supporting documentation.   Please advise if this requirement is considered to be commercial or commercial-type product.  Commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. All responses shall be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. local time, Thursday, June 3, 2004, to Ms. Jaime L. Carter.  Contact information is as follows:  Mail NASA/KSC, Mail Code:  OP-MS, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899.  Fax:  (321) 867 2825;  Email:  Jaime.Carter@nasa.gov.	Oral communication is unacceptable.  All technical question maybe submitted within the response. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.

<DESC>The US Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command in Warren, MI is conducting a market investigation for technical information from foreign vendors on a Enhanced Bridge Site Mobility System (EBSMS) for potential use by Army Multi-Role Bridging Compan ies.  The EBSMS will provide future expeditionary forces a wet gap bridge and ferrying capability contained in a single unit.  The EBSMS will combine seven separate functional systems into single unit, reducing the engineering bridging footprint and logist ics burden.  The EBSMS improves expeditionary forces√¢¬Ä¬ô mobility and capability while reducing the engineer√¢¬Ä¬ôs Multi-Role Bridging Company√¢¬Ä¬ôs (MRBC) battlefield footprint from seven systems to one.  Current MRBC wet gap and ferrying requirements  call for over 254 pieces of equipment to construct wet gap bridges.  EBSMS now combines seven separate systems into a single modular unit that is multi-functional.  EBSMS will enable MRBC√¢¬Ä¬ôs expeditionary units to construct a 100 meter bridge in less than 50% of the time, with 65% of the manpower.  The Logistics tail for the wet gap bridging and rafting will provide the biggest reduction in life cycle costs due to the reduced number of systems. The Army is interested in only those systems that are in p roduction and in use by other nation√¢¬Ä¬ôs armed forces.  The Army would like to run limited testing to determine the suitability of existing systems to meet our needs.   This market survey is for informational purposes only and is not a presolicitation notice.  A presolicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated.  All interested foreign firms regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this  request for information.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government.  All information provided will become the property of the US Government and will not be returned to the respondents.  Respondents must submit their product brochures, technical data, or other information concerning performance and cost within 30 days of this publication. POC Questions or responses to this market investigation shall be sent to Mr. Larry McNamara telephone (586) 574-5505, email mcnamarl@tacom.army.mil an alternate point of contact is Mr. James Biga (586) 574-4189, email bigaj@tacom.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>Integrated Installation Information Architecture
<DESC>This Special Notice has been updated to include the Request for Quotation. Statement of Requirement: Commander, Navy Installations (CNI) has a requirement for services to support the assessment, analysis, and planning associated with the development of an Integrated Installation Information Architecture (I3A) for the Navy-wide shore installation infrastructure. Background: CNI was established in October 2003 with a clear mandate to enhance the effectiveness of shore installation management.  The current CNI business environment is comprised of nine major business areas which are further divided into 32 sub-functional areas, each with its own set of applications and data sources.  CNI is working to significantly reduce the number of its applications and associated data sources and servers.  Other major CNI and Navy initiatives are already underway that are impacting the CNI IT environment.  CNI desires to take immediate action to develop a vision for a viable I3A end state in order to ensure that, as the CNI IT environment continues to evolve, all efforts are effectively aligned. CNI Vision: CNI?s future IT architecture (I3A) will support a robust decision support capability.  It will be expected that the I3A enable the transformation of integrated data into management information, provide data accessibility and situational awareness within and across functional areas, and support improvements in business processes by making available output-driven metrics via a significantly reduced number of standard applications.  The foundation of the I3A will be an effective and efficient integration of the NMCI network with the ?to-be? CNI infrastructure. Major objectives of I3A related initiatives include, but are not limited to: 1) standardization of applications to support establishment of common business practices; 2) alignment with Federal/DOD/Navy IT initiatives, mandates, and guidelines; 3) reduction of IT infrastructure costs and the CNI total cost of managing and operating Navy shore installations; 4) enhancement of management decision support systems; and 5) establishment of authoritative data sources. The I3A initiative will be a carefully planned and phased multi-year effort. Business Opportunity: CNI requires industry expertise in the areas of IT architecture, application rationalization, server consolidation, enterprise application and sensor integration to support the transformation of CNI?s ?as-is? environment into a more effective, efficient, and integrated enterprise IT infrastructure (?to-be?).  This business opportunity is a first step.  Contractor support will be required to: 1) conduct an analysis and assessment of the ?as-is? CNI IT environment in order to create an understanding of the relationship between business processes, applications, and organizations; 2) build on this understanding to develop a framework for the ?to-be? I3A; 3) develop a high-level migration plan using ?gap analysis? or other analytical methods to describe the ?way ahead.?  The migration plan will be supported by prioritized, actionable work packages that provide sufficient information for CNI to make implementation decisions.  Specific attention to identification or development of standards or criteria for sensor integration will be required.  The contractor will also perform analysis related to server consolidation planning and develop an approach that enables CNI to initiate actions that align with evolving Navy plans.  During the performance of work, the successful bidder will be required to integrate and work with other government organizations and support contractors engaged in supporting ongoing Navy and CNI IT initiatives. Contractual Approach: The planned acquisition strategy for this initial effort will be a competition among existing GSA Schedule holders, which will result in an award of an FFP order for a six-month period of performance.  At completion and acceptance of the contract deliverables, CNI will assess the viability of the solutions offered and formulate a plan to execute the CNI I3A initiative. Pre-Solicitation Conference: To further publicize and clarify the scope of the CNI I3A initiative, a ?Pre-Solicitation? Conference will be held on Thursday, 25 March 2004, from 1000 ? 1300 at the Crystal City Hilton Hotel.  Further information concerning the CNI IT Initiative and contractual approach associated with this FBO will be presented.  Additionally, a brief presentation of the current CNI IT projects and other identified government IT initiatives which will impact the CNI I3A initiative will be provided.  A question and answer session will follow. Further detailed information on this conference will be posted on the CNI Clearinghouse website.  All prospective offerors are urged to attend this conference.  In order to make the conference as productive as possible, offerors are requested to submit any questions in writing to the Contracting Officer, Code 0215AC, Contracts Division, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, SC, fax (843) 218-5930 or via e-mail (angela.e.carter@navy.mil) so as to arrive at least two working days prior to the conference.  Prospective offerors are requested to submit the names of the representatives who will attend the Pre-Solicitation Conference to Angela Carter (via fax or e-mail address noted above) no later than Monday, 22 March 2004.  Since space is limited, each prospective offeror is requested to send no more than 3 representatives to attend the Pre-Solicitation Conference.

<DESC>Comments are requested on the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for an OMB Circular A-76 Study of Civil Engineering Technician services (CET) in the following 15 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.  Currently, the NRCS in-house workforces of 127 employees within these states are performing these services. Civil Engineering Technician services includes providing services to private landowners throughout the states listed above to include, but not be limited to, field investigations and topographic surveys, inventories of soils, livestock, water resources, collection of data for planning, design and construction of soil and water conservation practices and watershed projects. These services utilize state-of-the-art survey equipment and computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), and include conducting soils investigations, performing designs of conservation practices and watershed projects, providing construction quality assurance and inspection during the construction of these conservation practices and watershed projects; as well as training of other staff and partner agency staff in providing these services to landowners.  In addition, these services include explaining applicable USDA, NRCS programs to landowners and other land users and working cooperatively with local Conservation District staff and other partner agencies.  A determination has been made that the studied services are subject to the Brooks Act, and the procedure for procurement of Architect-Engineer Services will be used. NRCS has requested a procedural deviation from OMB to conduct Architect-Engineer procurement procedures with the OMB Circular A-76 public-private competition process and still awaits final approval.  This is a DRAFT PWS and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a FORMAL RFP, RFQ, or contract.  The DRAFT PWS is available for download from the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov which is the official point of notification to the public.  This synopsis is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  This DRAFT PWS is open for comment until 11:59 P.M.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source purchase order firm-fixed price type to Laboratories At Bonfils 717 Yosemite Street Denver, CO 80230; for an on-going quality control study on Genetic testing of Thai baseline CONRAD specimen.  CDC need to use the same source as previous samples in order to maintain an essential capability for developmental work calling for the practical application of investigative findings and theories of a scientific nature. Although there is some information available with respect to HLA antigens and infectious diseases, the association of the vast majority of the various HLA alleles with susceptibility to and progression of infectious diseases remains unclear. Since there are over 2000 different HLA types and the technology is so labor intensive, it is more cost effective to have the HLA genotyping effort outsourced. Lab at Bonfils is the only known source for HLA typing for both moderate and high resolution that performs the vast majority of HLA typing for bone marrow transplantation (which requires moderate resolution) and is the only group that can provide DNA sequencing for the high resolution typing  for CDC.

<DESC>The title of this program is "Surveillance for Incident Cases of Asthma: Implementing Population-based Models in Health Plans and Managed-care Organizations.î  This program addresses the "Healthy People 2010" focus area(s) Maternal, Infant, and Child Health, and Respiratory Diseases.  The purpose of the program is to establish population-based surveillance for incident cases of asthma using data routinely collected by health plans. This data will be used to supplement the surveillance of asthma by State health departments and CDC and could eventually be part of a national network. Incident asthma surveillance sites will be population-based centers designed to assess the public health impact of asthma, to determine the incidence of asthma and to identify population-based risk factors associated with the onset of asthma. This program is designed to foster development of a physician-based reporting system, specifically, a system for the surveillance of incident cases of asthma utilizing health management plans. These model surveillance systems will help to identify incident cases of asthma to determine trends in the incidence and epidemiology of asthma.

	The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offerorís technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offerorís customers (contracts and/.or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offerorís record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offerorís quote.  The technical quote will be more significant than the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.

<RESPDATE>051104
<ARCHDATE>05262004
<CONTACT>Christopher Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-692-1626, Fax 202-692-1621, Email csmith2@peacecorps.gov - Christopher Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-692-1626, Fax 202-692-1621, Email csmith2@peacecorps.gov
<DESC>Vendor Q&A ñ Combine Solicitation PC04R004 (Peace Corps Overseas Hardware Refresh Project:  Q1: The Govt requests technical proposals (not to exceed 50 pages) in response to the SOW.  The Govt does not indicate specific topics, requirements, or areas of review for the content of the Technical Proposal. In addition, the Govt does not provide any indication of how the technical proposal will be weighted and/or evaluated.  Please provide more detail of technical proposal requirements and an indication of the scoring/evaluation methodology of the technical proposal.  A1: As noted in the 26 APR 2004 notice, parties are referred to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ñ Commercial Items. Similarly, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items, applies (see also FAR 12.206 Use of Past Performance, and FAR 15.304 Evaluation Factors and Significant Subfactors para (e)): The Basis for Award will be Best Value to the Govt; wherein, Technical Service Capability is ìapproximately equal to cost or price.î As evidence of the Technical Service Capability, vendors will be required to submit at least three (3) Past Performance references, detailing services of similar scope and term delivered to Federal or other business clients worldwide. There will be no limit to the length of these references and they will not count against a 50 page maximum Technical Proposal limit. The following is the Past Performance evaluation checklist contemplated: Customer; Contract/Project Title; Type of Agreement/Contract; Contact Name; $ Value; Performance Period; Program Mngr; Subcontractors; SOW Scope; SOW Deliverables; Complexity/Difficulty; Performance/Technical Objectives Achieved; Problem Area Resolution; Significant Accomplishments; Degree of Excellence/Award Fee or Rating (if applicable); Other Evaluation Factors: Quality of Service, Customer Satisfaction, Timeliness, Cost Control, Key Personnel, Project Mgmt.  Q2: Please clarify that the vendor is not required to provide any software loading and/or image development services for the new systems.  A2:  YES, Peace Corps Intl Tech Suppt Div staff will image the equipment at the overseas destination(s).  Q3: Please confirm that overseas shipping costs will be borne by the Govt, and are not expected to be included in the FFP (firm fixed) unit prices of the systems.  A3: YES, shipping costs are to be separate from the equipment price.  Q4: Delivery in 28 calendar days: standard delivery terms for CONUS (continental United States) locations is 30 days. Delivering equipment to remote OCONUS (outside continental United States) locations in 28 calendar days would be a big stretch. The equipment would have to come to a vendorís warehouse (no drop shipment possible) to be tagged and specially packed.  A4: Peace Corps Intl Tech Suppt Div staff notes that the time limit to get the equipment in country is actually 28 calendar days plus the 5 day window which gives a vendor, in effect, 33 days.  Q5: There is no detailed information on the delivery locations within the destination countries, which makes it impossible to predict how long it would take from a shipment to travel from the point of entry in the country to the actual final destination, which elevates the mandatory delivery requirement to an even higher risk.  A5: The delivery locations are the capitals of the countries in question. There are only two exceptions to this ñ Mexico and Bolivia. The vast majority of these have international airports. Peace Corps Intl Tech Suppt Div staff can provide a list of cities if necessary. The vast majority of shipments from their experience shipped airfreight take no more than 3 to 4 days to arrive in country. The full amount of time gives a shipper a full three weeks to process the order and get it out their door.  Q6: Proof of Delivery: the vendor is required to meet with the agency in the destination country for inspection of goods ñ a vendor would have to make arrangements with local companies in the various destination countries to have this requirement met. Plus there is no way to estimate the cost of doing this (meeting, inspecting) without some specific location.  A6: As mentioned in Q&A#5, the destination of the equipment is the capital. The vendor will engage a shipping agent to ship the equipment overseas. The shipping agent should be able to use their local agent in the destination city to perform the inspection. It is the vendorís responsibility to insure that the local shipping agent or another company performs this function.  Q7: Vendor will be assessed a 10 percent penalty if the 5 day delivery window is missed.  A7: IF the 5 day delivery window is missed, a 10 percent reduction will be applied to the invoice for that country. The vendor can win back the reduction simply by performing 10 subsequent shipments on time.  Q8: Missing or damaged equipment is required to be replaced at the vendorís cost in nor more than 10 days.  A8: Correct; if bad equipment is sent, it needs to be replaced immediately so as not to impact Peace Corps deployment of new equipment. An estimated loss/replacement factor should be stated in an offerorís proposal.  Q9: Does the limit on shipping ($12,000) include the cost to get the shipment from the port of embarkation to the final destination? For shipping costs above $12K, written approval from Peace Corps is required to proceed ñ does this waiting time count towards the delivery time?  A9: YES, the vendor should be able to forecast the shipping cost in advance to avoid delays (X computers = X kilos to Y location). A simple e-mail message or telephone call indicating that the shipment will exceed the $12K threshold is all that Peace Corps Intl Tech Suppt Div staff requires ñ their experience has been that only one or two countries listed exceeded the $12K limit during the initial deployment.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER:  PROC0400151 ñ AMENDMENT NO. 4.

This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to include the following Questions and Answers regarding this synopsis/solicitation:

Question No. 1.  Does the page count of 20 include:
         -   Cover Letter
        -    Reps. and Certs.
-	Pricing Information.

 Answer:  The 20 page limit does not include the: Cover letter, Representations and Certifications (52.212.3) and the examples pages for the 10 largest sales. Any lists, including brochures or catalogs, describing products which the company may offer to comply with Factor  (1) ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products, is included in the 20-page limit and will count toward the 20 page limit.

Cover letter or Introduction letter is not included in the 20-page limit and will not be considered a part of the proposal; therefore it will not be evaluated.   

Question No. 2.  Does the completed 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications) (13 pages long) count towards the 20 page limit?  Also, the PO's tied to the top ten largest deals in amendment 03, question 7...they don't count towards the page limit, correct?

Answer:  No, 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, does not count toward 20 page limit.
No, the copies for the 10 largest sales do not count toward the 20-page limit. (See No. 1 above).

Question No. 3. This references Schedule 70.  We are considered a small business under 500 employees on our GSA schedule.  Is our GSA Schedule certification the determining factor for us to qualify....

Answer:  No, the GSA certification is not the determining factor to qualify.  This acquisition lists Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, only as an example of types of Information Technology (IT) products found under this schedule, which the USPTO may acquire under the awarded Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  The NAICS for this requirement is 443120.  The small business size is 500 employees.  Companies will determine their existing business size at the present time according to the criteria of the NAICS 443120.

Question No. 4.  You state that all you will be buying is peripherals.  Yet on your sample product listing you show Sun product as well as servers.  Can you clarify this please?

Answer:  The USPTO is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle, which offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software, and licenses and maintenance like those that are found under Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services.  Servers are one of the many commercial items included under Schedule 70, which may be purchased.   See the synopsis/solicitation at FedBizopps or the USPTO website: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm
for additional information.

Question No. 5.  The proposal is supposed to be 20 pages. Are the reps and certs in addition to the 20 pgs, or do they count as part of the 20?  

Answer:  See Answer No. 1 and No. 2 above.

Question No. 6.  Does the table of contents and introduction letter count as part of the 20 pages?

Answer:  No, the table of contents does not count as part of the 20 pages. 
For introduction letter, see Answer No. 1 above. 
 
Question No. 7. Can you please clarify the due date of the above mentioned RFP? The General Information section of the FED BizOpps advertisement states a due date of May 10th, however the last paragraph of the advertisement states a due date of May 6th, please advise us as to the correct due date.

Answer:  Amendment No. 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151 clarifies that the closing date for the receipt of proposals is 1:00 pm (EST), May 10, 2004.

Question No. 8.- Can you clarify whether the 20 page count limit is inclusive or exclusive of pricing tables?

Answer:  See Answer No. 1 and Answer No. 2 above.
Question No. 9.  May we be allowed extra pages in our submittal for the supporting documentation for the Federal sales examples?  With 10 examples in a spreadsheet, and meeting the requirement to provide copies of purchase orders and invoices supporting those examples ñ we would likely exceed the limits of 10 pages for pricing/20 pages totals for our response.
Answer:  See answer No. 1 and Answer No. 2 above.
Question No. 10. - May I confirm that the required certifications and representations would be considered an attachment, and not be required to conform to the page limitations of our response?
Answer:  See Answer No. 1 and Answer No. 2 above.
Question No. 11. - To qualify, does the contractor need to have established relationships with 3 current customers with each customer having sales over $100,000 a year (i.e., more than $300,000 total a year) or the 3 combined customers having sales exceeding $100,000 a year?

Answer:  The requirement is in conjunction with ìPast Performanceî, one of the evaluation factors. The synopsis/solicitation at 17(viii) requires offerors to submit, among other items, ìReferences from 3 current customers with whose company has had an established relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year.î  The requirement is for the offeror to submit 3 references from 3 different customers, whom the offeror has sold over $100,000 a year in sales. Each reference provided should reflect sales of over $100,000 a year with that customer.    

Question No. 12. - Most authorized dealerships and authorized resellers are required to commit to specific volumes of sales per year.  For small businesses to become authorized resellers and dealers for wide array of computer hardware and software products, this would be cost prohibitive for small businesses. Is the prime contractor required to have signed reseller/dealership agreements in order to qualify? 

Answer:  Companies are not required to have signed reseller/dealerships agreements in order to qualify for an award under this BPA; however, if you are awarded an order under the BPA, companies will be required to be an authorized reseller or dealer of products at that time.  The USPTO does not intend to award any orders under this BPA for ìgrayî market items.  If a company is an authorized dealership or reseller for a product, the company should state this in their proposal under Factor 1 (ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products) in their capabilities statement.    

Question No. 13. - Does the prime contractor have to provide the 3 current customer references or can the prime contractor and teaming partners combine to satisfy this requirement?

Answer:  The prime contractor must be able to provide 3 current customer references in order to satisfy this requirement.

Question No. 14 - Is the prime contractor required to submit examples of its 10 largest sales or can the prime contractor and teaming partners combine to satisfy this requirement?

Answer:  The prime contractor is required to submit examples of the Offerorís 10 largest sales occurring in the last two years, which represent the types of IT products that the company has sold. This requirement should not be confused with the submittal of the 3 past performance references (Question No.11) from current customers with whom the company has had sales for $100,000 or more. 

Question No. 15.- What other IT contracts are in place, whose products could not be procured on this vehicle? (eg workstations, servers, SANS, etc)? 

Answer:  The USPTO has established contracts in place which includes desktops computers, laptops, monitors, printers, and PDAs.  

Question No. 16. - Offerors are required to submit examples of prices, discounts, or volume discounts for similar types of IT products in conjunction with evaluation factor No. 5 (Price).  Offerors are required to submit examples of its 10 largest sales, which represent the types of IT products, that the company has sold to the federal government community in the last two years.  Can Offerors submit sales, made to other than to the federal government community, as examples of its 10 largest sales?  

Answer:  Yes, Offerors may expand the scope of its examples to include other than the federal government community. 

Question No. 17. - 17 (viii) Offerorsí entire proposal, including catalogs and brochures, shall not exceed 20 pages in length.  Currently, your requirement states that there is a 20-page limit. Ten pages are set aside for company capabilities.  The remaining ten pages will easily be filled with our product catalog, pricing structure, warranty information, and delivery terms. Can the required Past Performance and Certs and Reqs be an attachment to the submitted proposal?

Answer:  See Answer No. 1 & 2.

Question No. 18. - Ref : 17 (xii) Section 508 Compliance - Since we donít know the specific requirements PTO will have, it is impossible for us to certify 508 compliance as compliancy is specific to individual products.  Is this something that would be done on an order-by-order basis after the BPA is issued?

Answer:  Yes.  Although there is a Section 508 certification requirement which applies to this BPA, certification will be required on an order-by-order basis.  

Question No. 19. -  ìRe: The Q&A question 1 (Amendment 3). What is the NAICS small business size for this requirement?  Answer: The NAICS is 443120 for the requirement listed in synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151. The small business size is 500.î  ìA number of companies are considered small on GSA Schedule but currently have over 500 employees.  Most RFP's require the certification of business size at the time of proposal submission.  This offeror request the Business size certification be at time of proposal submission.î

Answer:  Amendment 3, Question No. 4 states that this BPA is an award that is being made by the USPTO.  This procurement does not have any connection to GSA schedules, other than Schedule 70 is mentioned as an example of products that could be acquired under the USPTOís BPAs.  You are correct in that the business size would be determined at the proposal submission.
