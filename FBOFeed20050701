<DESC>The Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV) is a partnership-based conservation program under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that promotes the conservation of sea ducks by providing greater knowledge for effective management.  The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the SDJV, administers grants, purchase orders, and contracts on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance both our and the general scientific community's understanding of sea duck biology and ecology and is seeking proposals from interested parties.  To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  Currently the only source of general funding is U.S. Congress-appropriated funds directed to USFWS for SDJV use -- we are expected to demonstrate effective leveraging of these funds, preferably with non-U.S.-federal resources.  Awards will be issued via purchase orders, cooperative agreements, intra- or inter-agency agreements based on a Service analysis of the nature of each selected project in light of the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 (31 USC 6301-6308) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 17.5. Federal assistance awards (grants and cooperative agreements) will be administered under the direction of 43CFR12.

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation is to acquire the services of a professional Soil Scientist to finish building a NASIS type database for the Fishlake National Forest; this task will involve preparing Form 5 / Soil Interpretation Records from soil profile description forms and subsequently transferring all of this technical information over into the NRCS / NASIS database.  This action will allow the FS to eventually migrate these records back into our own NRIS database.  Specifically, a total of 159 soil descriptions will be selected by Fishlake National Forest / Soil Scientist - Michael D. Smith for this inquiry; all of the information listed for 1) landscape, 2) climate, 3) estimated soil properties, 4) existing vegetative communities and 5) geology will be re-entered into the NASIS ( 5.3 ) database.  In addition, the current taxonomic classification of each soil type, according to the USDA - Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy (1999), will be placed into the NASIS database.  This action will allow the NRCS computer programs to generate a listing of both suitability and limitation ratings about the potential of each soil type for recreational developments, building developments, sanitary facilities, construction materials and the management of water for urban settings, farming operations and domestic livestock.

Contractor shall be experienced in analyzing, interpreting and recording soil properties and site characteristics on Form 5 / Soil Interpretation Records followed by using data entry techniques in order to input both detailed and technical information about Forest Service / Soil Survey Projects into the current NRCS / NASIS ( 5.3 ) Database.  

All remaining field documentation for the Richfield and Loa Ranger Districts will be transferred into the NASIS Database according to the current National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS ) standards and guidelines.  All of this land resource information needs to be included within NASIS in order for the Fishlake National Forest to have a complete database for its Fremont-Monroe-Salina / Soil Survey Area.     

The contractor shall furnish all the labor, transportation and incidental items required to complete this project.

<SOLNBR>DE-RP30-05EW02000
<RESPDATE>082905
<ARCHDATE>09282005
<CONTACT>Karen L Bahan, Contracting Officer, 513-246-0555, karen.bahan@emcbc.doe.gov;Karen L Bahan, Contract Specialist, 513-246-0555, karen.bahan@emcbc.doe.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION LAND DISPOSAL OF GREATER-THAN-CLASS C LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE I.  OBJECTIVE FOR THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking industry input to identify commercial capability for the disposal of greater-than-Class C (GTCC) low-level radioactive waste (LLW) and certain DOE waste, with characteristics similar to GTCC LLW, that do not have a path forward for disposal.   This capability could also include treatment or other processing of these wastes to meet existing LLW disposal requirements. Identification of commercial capability will enable DOE to consider these capabilities for potential inclusion in the Disposal of Greater-Than-Class-C Low-Level Waste Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that DOE plans to initiate in late 2005.  Therefore, vendors that submit a response to this request for information may have their proposed disposal capability evaluated further during the EIS scoping, screening, and development process.  The EIS may also analyze the potential environmental impacts of disposing of these wastes at one or more Federal facilities. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals. II.  GENERAL INFORMATION Section 3(b)1(D) of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (LLRWPAA) assigns to the Federal Government responsibility for the disposal of GTCC LLW generated by U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees.  The LLRWPAA also specifies that GTCC LLW, which is designated a federal responsibility by subparagraph (b)(1)(D) of the Act, be disposed of in a facility licensed by the NRC and that the NRC determines is adequate to protect public health and safety. GTCC waste is LLW generated by NRC-licensed facilities with concentrations of radionuclides that exceed the limits established by NRC for Class C radioactive waste, as defined by 10 CFR 61.55.  Categories of GTCC LLW include:  (i) activated metals from nuclear power plants;  (ii) sealed sources that exceed Class C limits for waste classification; and (iii) other wastes, such as glove boxes, fuel fabrication equipment, and trash resulting from manufacture, research, utility, medical, agricultural, and industrial sources.  A 1994 report prepared for DOE by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory estimated the existing and projected packaged volume of commercial GTCC LLW at approximately 1,000 to 9,000 cubic meters (Greater-Than-Class C Low-Level Radioactive Waste Characterization:  Estimated Volumes, Radionuclides, and Other Characteristics, DOE/LLW-114, Revision 1, September 1994, http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10110584-cEr1aV/webviewable/). DOE is also reviewing its waste inventories with a view toward including those wastes with characteristics similar to GTCC LLW and which otherise do not have a path to disposal in the scope of the EIS.  DOE will inform vendors and other interested parties on the results of its waste inventory review and whether it has decided to include such waste in the scope of the EIS. The NRC regulations at 10 CFR 61.55 state that GTCC LLW â€œmust be disposed of in a geologic repository as defined in part 60 or 63 of this chapter unless proposals for disposal of such waste in a disposal site licensed pursuant to this part are approved by the Commission.â€  DOE could potentially use a number of systems for the disposal of GTCC LLW, including enhanced near surface disposal, intermediate depth disposal (30-200 meters depth), and deep geologic disposal, provided such methods are determined by NRC to be protective of public health and safety and can be licensed by NRC.  Different disposal configurations may be appropriate for the different categories of GTCC LLW (i.e., sealed sources, activated metals, other GTCC LLW).  At a minimum, performance objectives and requirements similar to Part 61 are expected (although the final licensing requirements are not known at this time). On May 11, 2005, DOE published the Advance Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Disposal of Greater-Than-Class C Low-Level Radioactive Waste in the Federal Register (70 FR 24775) (http://www.eh.doe.gov/nepa/pub_noi_toc.html). III.  AREAS TO ADDRESS IN SUBMISSION Vendors possessing expertise and successful past experience and performance in the management and disposal of radioactive waste in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulatory requirements are of particular interest. Interested vendors should submit a capability statement in response to this Request for Information.  The capability statement should include, at a minimum, the following information: 1. Name of company, including a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; 2. Company address; 3. Company size (please specify as either-Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), Hubzone Small Business or other); 4. Discussion of vendorâ€™s ability to perform the type of services described above including:  i) technical discussion of the proposed treatment and/or disposal system and key design concepts;  ii) treatment and/or disposal location, site ownership and control of the treatment and/or disposal location, and environmental setting, if available (if a vendor is unable to identify the proposed location at this time, an explanation of why it cannot provide this information and when this information will be available); and iii) estimated cost and duration for site-selection (if required), site characterization, licensing and permitting, construction, operation, and closure of a new facility or modifying and licensing of an existing facility for GTCC disposal. Additionally, the systems analyzed could include treatment or other processing of GTCC LLW to meet existing LLW disposal requirements.  Additionally, to facilitate analysis of no action alternatives within the EIS, vendors should include handling and storage capabilities, as appropriate.  It is understood that limited design information will allow only order-of-magnitude cost estimates to be developed. 5. Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude; 6. Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel; and 7. Identify and clearly mark any proprietary data. Please submit a capability statement by Close of Business 4:30 PM, on, August 29, 2005, to Mr. James Joyce, U.S. Department of Energy, EM-10/Cloverleaf Building, 1000 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, DC 20585-2040, by mail, express service delivery, or electronically (to james.joyce@em.doe.gov). DOE may ask vendors to clarify information provided in their capability statement or submit additional information.

<DESC>The Department of Energy, Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory (RESL), has the requirement for rotary evaporator system.  This system is to be used for preparation of performance evaluation soil standards in support of the Mixed Analyte Performance Evaluation Program.  Limited laboratory space requires that the system be free standing and compact in design.  The system must also be mounted in a portable fashion so it can be easily moved from storage location to use location with a minimal of effort.  The system must be fully self-contained to include; support cart, water chiller, rotary evaporator unit, associated glassware, and vacuum support pumps.  The sample flasks must be baffled to achieve adequate mixing of the soil during the evaporation process.  The evaporation flask neck must be large enough for a man with large hands to be able to place his hand within the flask for scraping soil from the sides of the flask after drying.  The system must be fitted with a system of adding solvents to the flask during operation, without disassembly.  The system must be automated for unsupervised operation and fitted with automatic shutoffs in the case the bath should run dry.  All these requirements are crucial and none are negotiable.  The specifications are attached.  The Buchi Rotavapor R-220 rotary evaporator system is the only known product that meets all these requirements.  Interested parties that believe they can provide an instrument that fulfills the requirements may respond to this request within ten days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  All quotes must be submitted by e-mail to the contract specialist listed below.

GSA also intends to use Building Information Model (BIM) technology during the design and construction of this project, and seeks construction firms with experience with BIM technology; however, this experience is not required.  The BIM will be included as a sub-factor during the Request for Proposal (RFP) submission evaluations.  The building is approximately 9,803 gross square meters (gsm) or 105,520 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 11,517 gsm or 123,970 gsf including 41 interior parking spaces.  The proposed facility will provide space for multiple agencies including U. S. District Court, U. S. Bankruptcy Court, Social Security Administration, and several other executive agency offices. The proposed facility will be constructed in downtown Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $30 million to $40 million for the combined services (pre-construction and optional construction phase services).  This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis. The North American Industry Classification System Code(s)(NAICS) for this procurement is 238990 with a Size Standard of $27.5 million.  The project will be designed and constructed in Metric Units of Measure. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.

The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall possess a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of this facility.

<DESC>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, Disaster Prevention Response Branch intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with Foundation Coal Company's Emerald Coal Resources LP for the drilling of three experimental boreholes on the surface above longwall B3 prior to undermining.  The purpose of the cooperative effort is to obtain specific reservoir, geomechanical and lithological data for ongoing numerical modeling efforts which are designed to predict methane emission levels into the underground environment prior to mining.   

BACKGROUND

As part of its mine safety research program, NIOSH’s Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has initiated a reservoir modeling effort to better understand the interaction of the various geotechnical factors influencing methane flow within the underground longwall mining environment.  Numerical models can offer the coal mining industry versatile solutions for their methane-related problems and answer specific questions related to methane control without exposing the work force to potentially hazardous methane concentrations.  This methane prediction technology is complex and needs to be created through extensive research and development.  

One critical aspect of this modeling approach is that the models require real, accurate input data and calibrations based on monitoring data to achieve reliable predictions of methane movement and emission.  The developed modeling scenarios can be somewhat site-specific where a model developed for one mine may not be readily used in another mine, unless some changes in the input data are made.

During the last 10 years of NIOSH collaboration with Foundation Coal (formerly RAG, Inc.) in methane control research, an extensive database was created.  The proposed borehole monitoring experiment is part of a numerical modeling initiative to develop the ways to better control methane for an enhanced underground workplace safety. Therefore, specifically for modeling research, the proposed study is critical for enabling NIOSH researchers to obtain vital parameters that cannot be obtained otherwise. These data will help them to further improve their modeling techniques and the predictive capabilities of the final products which will ultimately be widely applicable, once the research model is sufficiently developed.  Performing this experiment on Foundation Coal’s property is essential for making this research a continuation of previous field and modeling studies.  	

This announcement is being issued for informational purposes only; a request for quotation is not available.  To consider this effort for competition, another organization would need to demonstrate that they would have data available and a mining location for boreholes that would provide a proper environment for predicting methane emission levels prior to underground mining.  Responses shall be submitted to Margaret Mooney at zia3@cdc.gov and responses must be received within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  If any responses are submitted in response to this presolicitation notice and the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responders of this notice.  A subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12, Commercial Procedures.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has an on-going requirement for Scramjet Flow Path Technology Research. The scope of the proposed contract is to provide and maintain the capability for the design and fabrication of aero-propulsion test hardware, the operation and management of specialized test facilities, and the testing of hypersonic propulsion flow path concepts at duplicated flight Mach numbers from 4 to 20.  The work under this contract will provide for:  (1) the operation and application of shock-heated and comubstion-heated test facilities and supporting equipment to conduct test and evaluation of hypersonic aero-propulsion flow path research at conditions that duplicate flight across the atmosphere from static sea level to near orbital.  Specifically, as part of this activity, is the operation and management of the Government Furnished Hypersonic Pulse Facility (HYPULSE) in either shock-expansion tunnel, or reflected-shock tunnel configurations.  (2) The acquisition of facility and propulsion flow path data and the application of data processing tools to provide well defined test conditions and performance of test articles.  These data include, but are not limited to visual and laser-based diagnostic techniques. (3) The conduct of hypervelocity aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic research in a shock-heated tunnel at test gas flows up to Mach 20 simulation. (4) The design and manufacture of research test hardware consisting of specialized aero-propulsion test facility components and engine flow path components.  Key to the performance of this effort is NASA's HYPULSE shock tunnel facility that can be operated as a shock-expansion tunnel that is unique among hypersonic test facilities in that it can deliver a hypervelocity air test gas flow which closely approximates the air encountred in flight at Mach numbers up to 20. In addition, other Government facilities and test hardware located at the contractor facility provide test capabilities that complement NASA facilities.  Unique among these is the Flight-Accelleration Simulation Test (FAST) facility, which supports other NASA Center's Advanced Reusable Transportation (ART) program.	These apparatus have become integrated into the contractor infrastructure sharing air and propellant supplies, vacuum systems and electrical and data systems. The HYPULSE and FAST facilies are Government Furnished property pursuant to FAR Part 45. The proposed cost reimbursement contract is expected to use indefinite quantity requirements which will be specified by performance based task orders over a five year period of performance.  The performance of certain requirements may be classified SECRET. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from GASL Division of Alliant Techsystems (ATK-GASL) in Ronkonkoma, NY on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii).   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications [are] acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Melbourne, Australia (the incumbent) for the completion of a Phase II clinical trial of pediatric subjects in Fiji under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The incumbent shall provide a continuation of a Phase II pneumococcal conjugate vaccine clinical trial for the enrollment of additional 200-300 subjects.  With the enrollment of the additional subjects, this increase will allow the clinical trial to attain statistically significant and clinically meaningful data.  The incumbent will revise their protocol and study documents to determine a safe and efficacious vaccination regimen for Fiji, using a lesser number of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine doses accompanied by a plain 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to broaden the immune response.  The current US-licensed seven-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) is highly efficacious in preventing vaccine serotype disease.  However, this conjugate vaccine is licensed with a four dose primary series and is expensive, costing approximately USD $200/infant.  If used in the recommended dose regimen, it would consume a large portion of a developing country’s health budget.  Cost is a primary reason many countries have not yet introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and they are seeking alternative regimens that will be both efficacious and affordable.  
The incumbent (University of Melbourne) currently has 228 subjects enrolled in the study. The subjects enrolled in the trial are scheduled to receive their 12-month vaccination in early September 2005.  The incumbent must administer the next dose of vaccine in order to assure the health and safety of the subjects.  If the 12-month vaccination is not administered, there are potential ethical ramifications for the subjects, parents and guardians and their participation in future research.  Moreover, not providing the 12-month vaccination will result in a loss of vital clinical and safety data for the currently enrolled subjects.
The incumbent will work with the NIAID staff to revise a protocol and study documents to complete the Phase II clinical trial, including assaying samples, analyzing results, and generating a final report.  The proposed award represents a continuation of work originally awarded to the University of Melbourne in 2002.  Institutions which believe they have the requisite ability to perform this requirement may provide a capability statement identifying their business type e.g. educational institution, small business, large for-profit, etc. and a contact person and phone number within 45 days of this announcement.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted. Questions regarding this action may be submitted to Liem T. Nguyen on 301-451-3687.

<DESC>Provide Local Telephone Service for DMEA as defined herein.  The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain local telephone communications  service and support.  Included in the contract are provisions for the reuse of the existing PBX and if needed the purchase of and interface between the PBX and new phone service line. 

1.1  Background: Telephone service for DMEA employees and DMEA customers is a vital part of the engineering process.   Long distance is provided for under another DMEA contract and is not a part of this agreement.

1.2  Location: 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA, 95652

1.3 Additional Information: The NPA for DMEA is 916.  The present NXXs for DMEA are 231 and 414.  

2.0 Definitions: The following definitions are given for the purpose of this contract:

demarc:  A demarc (an abbreviation for demarcation point) marks the point where communications facilities owned by one organization interface with that of another organization. In telephone terminology, this is the interface between customer-premises equipment and telecommunications  service provider’s equipment.  A synonym is network terminating interface (NTI)

NPA: Numbering Plan Area (telephony, AKA: Area Code)

NXX: Network Numbering Exchange (in North American Numbering Plan)
     
 3.0 Requirements: 

3.1 Location: The telecommunication circuit shall be installed at 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA 95652. The contractor shall install a telecommunications circuit and provide telecommunications service.  The telecommunication communication circuit shall be installed in room 159.  Installation shall be accomplished so as to minimize downtime of DMEA’s telephone connection and service. Additional work shall be performed at the contractor’s site as needed in support of this contract.

3.2 Current equipment and related information: At present, DMEA uses a PBX switch made by Tadiran. Local telephone service is provided over ISDN via PRI. Reuse of the existing PBX shall be a requirement of this contract.   DMEA uses an Adtran T1 CSU (Ace) as the interface between the phone company circuit and one PRI card installed in the Tadiran switch that accepts the PRI circuit (23 ISDN channels). We have a spare T1 card that was used  with our previous T1 service.   DMEA calls go out from the lower ISDN channels up, and incoming calls come from the higher ISDN channels down. DMEA has never run out of open channels for our calling needs – usually many channels are idle. The number of channels shall not be reduced by this  new contract.

3.3 Work to be performed: The contractor shall install all necessary hardware as required to provide the telephone communication service to DMEA.  The new telecommunications circuit and service shall be fully operational within 30 days ARO.  The Contractor shall submit a Site Preparation Plan to the Contracting Officer within 10 days ARO. The Site Preparation Plan shall identify all changes required of Government-provided space in order to deliver services.  All costs associated with any site changes will be determined and negotiated.  DMEA will approve or request changes to the site preparation plan within 5 business days.   After submission and acceptance of the Site Preparation Plan, further alterations or modifications in the site preparation plan which are directly attributable to failure to adequately identify changes initially shall be furnished at no cost to the Government, and any additional non-recurring and recurring charges attributable to those alterations or modifications shall unless directed by the Government be borne by the Contractor. 

3.4 Security: The contractor is required to provide advance notification prior to conducting any on-site inspection, installation or maintenance.  A two (2) hour minimum notice during normal business hours shall be given.  In general, all installation and maintenance work will be performed by US citizens.  Exceptions to this can be made (1) if no US Citizen is capable of performing the work and (2) with the advance approval of the DMEA director.  Contractor personnel shall provide proof of citizenship in accordance with the DMEA visitor approval process in effect at the time the visit is requested and prior to being allowed entry into DMEA facilities.  During periods of exceptionally heightened security, additional advance notice and background investigations of contractor personnel may be required prior to gaining entry into DMEA. DMEA may at that time require additional minimum notice during normal business hours be given.  Exceptions to these requirements can only be made with approval of the DMEA director.  Exceptions generally require 5-10 working days advance notice.
 
3.5 Applicable standards: All preparations shall be in compliance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Electronic Industries Association (EIA), National Electrical Code, and all state and local codes. 

3.6 Acceptance criteria: The contractor shall develop and conduct an acceptance test that demonstrates to DMEA that all requirements of this contract have been met.  The initial acceptance test shall be conducted and successfully completed immediately after installation of the new telephone communication circuits.

3.7 Special requirements: The following special requirements apply to this contract:

PBX will be reconfigured by DMEA during the cutover to allow outbound calls to be routed out the new service. Downtime during normal work hours (6 AM to 6 PM Monday through Friday) shall not exceed 2 hours total during the change over.

3.7.2 The contractor shall reuse the existing PBX equipment and interface cards to the greatest extent possible.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to (1) evaluate a panel of serological assays that reflect hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress to differentiate among NAFLD, NASH, or cryptogenic cirrhosis, (2) identify protein alterations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis, (3) evaluate noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NASH including but not limited to the use of elastrography, nuclear magnetic resonance, molecular imaging, and (4) provide S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) to perform a randomized controlled trial of therapy of NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis.

The NAFLD Database study – A prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or cryptogenic cirrhosis was created by the NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN), which is currently accruing patients, and ultimately allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of approximately 1,500 patients for 3 years on average.

In addition to the NAFLD Database study, the NASH CRN has developed two treatment trials: (1) PIVENS – to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with either pioglitazone or vitamin E lowers NASH activity as determined from hepatic histology in nondiabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo, (2) TONIC – to determine whether 96 weeks of treatment with either metformin or vitamin E leads to sustained reduction in serum alanine transferase in nondiabetic children with NAFLD compared to treatment with placebo.  PIVENS is currently recruiting patients and TONIC will begin recruitment by June, 2005.

Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease present a variety of opportunities for CRADAs.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to provide s-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) to perform a randomized controlled trial of therapy of cryptogenic cirrhosis.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a CRADA to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include:  1) Exploration of serum markers for fibrosis and serum markers for disease activity to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic variables in the NAFLD Database study.  2) Exploration of the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in adult (PIVENS) and pediatric (TONIC) treatment trials.  3) Evaluation of the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NASH or NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum peroxides in patients with NASH or NAFLD participating in treatment trials.  4) Develop serum/plasma proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis and that would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  5) Use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necro-inflammatory or fibrotic activity in NAFLD or NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NAFLD or NASH.  (6) Evaluation of the role of noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NASH.  (7) Investigation of S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as an antioxidant and therapeutic agent for NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and may make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of the NASH Clinical Research Network is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with NAFLD or NASH using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of NAFLD or NASH and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by the NAFLD Database on adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis including clinical information as well as serum, plasma, liver tissue, and DNA samples.  A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:  1. The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of pioglitazone or metformin or vitamin E in patients with NAFLD or NASH and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.  2. The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  3. The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, Commerce Business System (CBS) Support Center has a continued need for Relocation Manager Module Maintenance for Progressive/UNIX/Windows Platform supporting up to 10 concurrent Users.  The Government intends on procuring the maintenance subscription from ePCS Support Services, LLC, 21351 Ridgetop Circle, Suite 300, Dulles, Virginia on a sole source basis.  ePCS is a small business and is the exclusive authorized federal reseller of Gelcos Relocation Manager.  The Gelco Relocation Manager is a significant component of the mixed systems interfaced with the CBS.  It meets the Governments need for Permanent Change of Station (PCS) functionality and is compatible with the current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, CBS system(s) that the Government has invested time and funds in implementing and operating for an extended period of time.  The Gelco Relocation Manager (RM) interfaces/interconnects to the Governments CBS system and shares obligation, funding, and voucher data, allowing for interoperability between the systems.  The Government owns perpetual licenses for this software. These services that are being obtained herein are associated with maintenance of the licenses owned by the Government. These services include updates to the software product, enhancements, and ongoing rate data.  Only ePCS has access to the Source Code for the software and, as such, is the only firm that can provide the maintenance.  This is a follow-on requirement for providing the software maintenance for the RM COTS product in which the Government anticipates duplication of cost associated with procuring software, interfacing, and training that would not be recovered through competition.  In addition, the Government anticipates that competition would likely result in unacceptable delays and disruption to the continuity of operations associated with the Commerce Business Systems as the result of procuring other software, interfacing/interconnection, and retraining.  This requirement will be for a base year of twelve months and include four Option Years of twelve months each.  The place of performance will be Gaithersburg, Maryland. The NAICS code is 541519 and the size standard is $21 million in annual average gross revenue over the last three fiscal years.  The anticipated award date is on or before September 30, 2005.  See numbered note 22. Information provided in accordance with numbered note 22 shall be submitted in writing to Linda Shariati, CBS Support Center, 209 Perry Parkway, Suite 5, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20877-2143. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this announcement or Government use of any information provided.

STATEMENT OF WORK
INVESTMENT DIVISION
POST-VENTURE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES

PROGRAM BACKGROUND SUMMARY

The Investment Division of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) administers the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program.  SBICs are privately-owned and privately-managed venture capital funds.  These funds are licensed and regulated by the SBA and receive supplemental funding (leverage) from he SBA.  As of April 13, 2005 there were 438 active SBICs, of which 328 receive leverage from the SBA.  These licensees receiving leverage from the SBA are classified as either debenture (numbering 124) or participating securities (numbering 204) SBICs.  

Under the terms of the program, all SBICs must invest in small businesses.  In FY 2004, SBICs reported 4400 investments in 2400 small businesses totaling $2.8 billion.  Participating securities SBICs accounted for approximately half of these investments; however, no new participating securities SBICs are expected to be licensed.  Under the participating securities portion of the program, the SBA may receive distributions from the SBIC in the form of marketable securities (in kind) in addition to cash.  SBA has determined it needs assistance in the management and disposition of the marketable securities it will receive through these distributions.  Participating Securities SBICs currently have approximately $15 billion in capital resources under management.

Objective  

The Investment Division’s objective for in kind distributions is to achieve liquidity as soon as possible while minimizing SBA's risk of loss and giving consideration to the distribution’s upside potential.  To accomplish that objective SBA is seeking to enter into a contractual arrangement with an organization which is knowledgeable about and proficient in the evaluation and trading of thinly traded equity securities and which has experience in the management of venture capital distributions.

Term of the Contract

One year with four one-year options.

Scope of Contract       

The contractor will provide services associated with the management of distributions received by the SBA.  Such services will include, but may not be limited to, conduct of research and valuation activities necessary to advise SBA as to whether securities qualify as “Distributable Securities”, as defined in 13 CFR 107.50, and to develop an appropriate liquidation strategy for each security under management; assumption of responsibility for liquidation decisions on a discretionary basis, subject to SBA’s objectives and direction; trading of securities; establishment and maintenance of third-party relationships necessary to conduct activities under the contract and satisfy SBA’s overall objectives; and preparation of reports to SBA concerning transactions and the status of securities under management.

The contractor will provide SBA with same-day notice by telephone, facsimile, and email of any sale of securities, including price and quantity of shares sold.  The contractor will prepare a monthly activity report containing complete information on each transaction concluded, including any gain or loss on disposition of securities as well as the current market value and the contractor’s estimate of the time frame for each security under management.  The contractor shall deliver this monthly report both in paper copy and electronically in Microsoft Word one copy of this report no later than 10 calendar days after the end of the month.  In addition, the contractor will prepare quarterly and annual activity reports containing a summary of transactions during the period, the contractor’s evaluation of the securities awaiting disposition as of the end of the period, and the costs charged to SBA under the contract, both for the period and on a cumulative basis through the end of the period.  This contractor shall deliver this quarterly report both in paper copy and electronically in Microsoft Word one copy of this report no later than 10 calendar days after the end of each quarter.

Place of Performance/Travel

The contractor shall perform the duties listed herein at its place of business.  The contractor shall travel to the Investment Division’s place of business located at SBA headquarters as requested.  

Confidentiality and Disclosure 

All information obtained by the contractor from SBA and licensees shall be disclosed only to SBA personnel and shall not be used for any reason by the contractor and staff other than performance of its duties required hereunder.  The contract or shall sign a confidentiality agreement to ensure the contractor safeguards the information provided by the SBA or prepared by the contractor with regards to this contract.

All software purchased and databases created and populated for use under this contract will become the property of SBA.     

Contract Award

Evaluation will be conducted and selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) intends to publish a request for proposals to negotiate a competitive contract for a series of technical assistance (TA) training programs focused on aviation security quality control to be conducted in three regions:  (1) the Americas; (2) Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and (3) Asia.  The proposed training programs would be developed in collaboration with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).   Over the course of approximately one year, The training will take place over the course of three days within each region.  The same training session will be offered twice in the Americas, twice in Asia, and three times in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, for a total of seven trainings.

 The objective of this TA is to bring together foreign officials responsible for their nation’s aviation quality control programs.  It will provide a forum to learn and to discuss how quality control can be enhanced in each of their countries and standardized throughout the regions.  The training program would also highlight the benefits to international trade that would result from better securing the commercial aviation sector.  The TA will educate participants on the applicable international protocols, and present methods for achieving a higher level of security to enhance the movement of goods and people.  This activity will also assist USTDA with its efforts to promote trade opportunities for U.S. suppliers abroad.  USTDA anticipates award of a single contract, at a ceiling price of NTE $600,000, based on a cost, plus, fixed-fee basis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries intends to negotiate a sole source agreement with Sti-Co Industries, Inc., of Orchard Park, NY for covert fender mount antennas (Narrow Band, Superband, and Dual Band) for undercover vehicles for our federal customers.  From the fender these antennas look exactly like the original AM/FM antenna that comes with the vehicle and are mounted in the same way as the original antenna, which maintains the integrity of the undercover vehicle.  They are specific to the make, model and year of each car or truck.  These two-way antennas are available in narrow band (factory tuned to our specific frequency), Superband (covering the whole portion of one frequency range) and dual band (transmitting and receiving in portion of two frequency ranges) but still allow for the continued operation of the AM/FM radio and the Motorola police radios being utilized by our current customers.  A justification for other than full and open competition is on file.  No solicitation documents are available and requests for such will not be acknowledged.  The determination not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No telephone inquires will be accepted.  It is anticipated that a sole source purchase order will be awarded as specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Par 13.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Closing date is July 6, 2005.

(2) The fuel cell stack experienced cathode flooding wh ich prevented the chemical reaction between oxygen and the methanol solution. (3) The degrading mechanism was related to the external air manifold design that placed constraints on operation and reliability of the DMFC stack.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation of Bids (IFB) for the award of a firm-fixed contract for Underwater Pipeline Removal at the Arthur Kill Channel Navigation Improvement Project, Contract 2, New York an d New Jersey. The project consists of the removal of pipelines in the Arthur Kill Channel.  Due to the ongoing neighboring construction of the Arthur Kill 41 ft Federal Channel, it will be necessary to remove derelict or abandoned pipelines that cross the channel in Contract AK-2/3. A total of nine (9) steel pipelines and pipeline debris have been identified for removal. These pipelines range in size from 8 to 12 inches in diameter. The condition (cut, open, capped, intact) varies. The total linear footage of pipelines to be removed in each of the pipeline crossing areas has been estimated to be nearly 13,500 linear feet; this is estimated to result in as much as 350 tons of pipeline for removal from the pipeline crossing areas. The pipeline debris zone has been estimated to be as much as 5000 linear feet of pipeline debris weighing up to 100 tons. It is anticipated that the contract will require the use of specialized equipment in order to remove the pipelines in the channel, which are under water and may in  some areas be more than 43 ft deep. In addition due to vessel traffic this will require the existing channel depth to be maintained during and after the construction effort.  The estimated cost range for this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,00 0.00. The selected contractor must complete the work no later than 90 calendar days after the date the contractor receives the Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>This sources sought corrects the response date from June 6, 2005 to July 6, 2005 The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying the specific agency requirements identified herein that may be procured in the near future. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the!  procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research. Information on capable sources are sought for the following requirements:  The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) is currently involved in research and development for Phase II Personnel Transfer Systems Studies, in support of the Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) Program.  The JHSV will be an ocean going vessel that is capable of self-deploying from the Continental United States to an advanced base where it will serve as a high-speed means to transfer cargo and personnel from the sea base to the shore. A critical capability required to enable the High Speed Connector (HSC) concept is the ability to transfer personnel at sea between JHSV’s and other ships.  This capability will enable phased at sea arrival and assembly and enhance force closure of the Maritime Prepositioning Force Future MPF(F) Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB). The primary goal of this effort is to build upon a previously executed industry survey and concept design effort that identified candidate solutions. This effort will build upon the initial phase by building scale demonstrators represe! nting transfer systems between JHSV’s and Maritime Prepositioning Force Future ships in support of sea basing operations.

This task is the continuation of the implementation of the ONE-NET network OCONUS.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.

STATEMENT OF WORK
INVESTMENT DIVISION
POST-VENTURE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES

PROGRAM BACKGROUND SUMMARY

The Investment Division of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) administers the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program.  SBICs are privately-owned and privately-managed venture capital funds.  These funds are licensed and regulated by the SBA and receive supplemental funding (leverage) from he SBA.  As of April 13, 2005 there were 438 active SBICs, of which 328 receive leverage from the SBA.  These licensees receiving leverage from the SBA are classified as either debenture (numbering 124) or participating securities (numbering 204) SBICs.  


Under the terms of the program, all SBICs must invest in small businesses.  In FY 2004, SBICs reported 4400 investments in 2400 small businesses totaling $2.8 billion.  Participating securities SBICs accounted for approximately half of these investments; however, no new participating securities SBICs are expected to be licensed.  Under the participating securities portion of the program, the SBA may receive distributions from the SBIC in the form of marketable securities (in kind) in addition to cash.  SBA has determined it needs assistance in the management and disposition of the marketable securities it will receive through these distributions.  Participating Securities SBICs currently have approximately $15 billion in capital resources under management.


Objective  

The Investment Division’s objective for in kind distributions is to achieve liquidity as soon as possible while minimizing SBA's risk of loss and giving consideration to the distribution’s upside potential.  To accomplish that objective SBA is seeking to enter into a contractual arrangement with an organization which is knowledgeable about and proficient in the evaluation and trading of thinly traded equity securities and which has experience in the management of venture capital distributions.

Term of the Contract

One year with four one-year options.

Scope of Contract       

The contractor will provide services associated with the management of distributions received by the SBA.  Such services will include, but may not be limited to, conduct of research and valuation activities necessary to advise SBA as to whether securities qualify as “Distributable Securities”, as defined in 13 CFR 107.50, and to develop an appropriate liquidation strategy for each security under management; assumption of responsibility for liquidation decisions on a discretionary basis, subject to SBA’s objectives and direction; trading of securities; establishment and maintenance of third-party relationships necessary to conduct activities under the contract and satisfy SBA’s overall objectives; and preparation of reports to SBA concerning transactions and the status of securities under management.

The contractor will provide SBA with same-day notice by telephone, facsimile, and email of any sale of securities, including price and quantity of shares sold.  The contractor will prepare a monthly activity report containing complete information on each transaction concluded, including any gain or loss on disposition of securities as well as the current market value and the contractor’s estimate of the time frame for each security under management.  The contractor shall deliver this monthly report both in paper copy and electronically in Microsoft Word one copy of this report no later than 10 calendar days after the end of the month.  In addition, the contractor will prepare quarterly and annual activity reports containing a summary of transactions during the period, the contractor’s evaluation of the securities awaiting disposition as of the end of the period, and the costs charged to SBA under the contract, both for the period and on a cumulative basis through the end of the period.  This contractor shall deliver this quarterly report both in paper copy and electronically in Microsoft Word one copy of this report no later than 10 calendar days after the end of each quarter.


Place of Performance/Travel

The contractor shall perform the duties listed herein at its place of business.  The contractor shall travel to the Investment Division’s place of business located at SBA headquarters as requested.  

Confidentiality and Disclosure 

All information obtained by the contractor from SBA and licensees shall be disclosed only to SBA personnel and shall not be used for any reason by the contractor and staff other than performance of its duties required hereunder.  The contract or shall sign a confidentiality agreement to ensure the contractor safeguards the information provided by the SBA or prepared by the contractor with regards to this contract.  


All working papers, notes, photocopies and other materials produced and received by the contractor will be kept by the contractor but are subject to review by SBA, its auditors and designees.  All software purchased and databases created and populated for use under this contract will become the property of SBA.     


Contract Award

Evaluation will be conducted and selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  Award will be made to the party whose cost proposal represents the best value to the Government considering quality of the technical proposal and relative cost.


Pursuant to FAR, the SBA reserves the right to award a contract based upon initial responses submitted and without any further discussions with the potential awardees.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE issued by USAID/Cambodia to determine the availability of potential organizations who could implement the ongoing Returnee Assistance Project (RAP).  Input received will assist in determining whether there are organizations willing to manage and implement RAP. 

Interested organizations responding to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice should submit a capability statement that provides sufficient detailed information to allow the government to determine the organization’s interest and qualifications to implement such a project. This documentation should not exceed two pages and may include examples of relevant projects they have implemented, references including title, names, and telephone numbers, and any other relevant information.

This is not a Request for Applications and does not commit USAID to make an award.  USAID does not intend to make an award based solely on submissions or responses to this Sources Sought Notice nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

Written capability statements must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. Cambodia time on July 14, 2005.  These submissions must be submitted by E-mail (ONLY) to Sokunn Mealea Prak at sprak@usaid.gov.  In the Subject line Reference:   Sources Sought Notice: RAP.  Facsimile and Hand Carried submissions will not be accepted.  
OVERVIEW OF RAP PROGRAM
In March 2002, the United States and Cambodia Governments’ entered into an agreement that would authorize more than 1,000 Cambodians with a felony conviction living in the United States to be deported back to Cambodia.  In response to this, the Returnees Assistance Project was created by a group of interested and concerned individuals to assist “Returnees”.

Many of the Returnees lived most of their lives in the U.S. and have little or no cultural connection to Cambodia. The RAP project was designed to assist the Returnees to re-assimilate back into Cambodian society.  The RAP program aims at assisting in a variety of ways, including providing time bound returnee support services such as: pre-departure orientation information, relative location support, cultural assimilation support, housing referrals, job placement support, vocational training, peer counseling support, substance abuse counseling, etc.   A small number of the returnees typically have acute mental health disorders that may require specialized long-term care.   RAP has already gained important experience and “lessons learned” in assisting approximately 130 returnees to date. 

The RAP implementer would be expected to maintain effective management oversight: establish case management files for Returnees participating in RAP, establish systems to provide the stated services, and maintain financial management systems consistent with USAID regulations. Organizations would have to be registered legal entities able to obtain a direct grant from USAID.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), 1100  New York Avenue, NW, Suite 1090E, Washington, DC 20005 under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  For the past year and a half, NAPA has provided administrative review services to the NIH.  Specifically, NAPA has worked with implementation teams, and other administrative and program areas to facilitate, integrate, and track progress on major change initiatives occurring at NIH; developed the NIH administrative change-management guide to Administrative Restructuring at NIH; and has been involved in the development and implementation plan of many of the completed restructuring activities.  NIH has a need for NAPA to continue providing the administrative review services for a 5 month period with 3-three month options.  These services include:  fact-finding analysis, general reviews and reports of various initiatives; developing project/change-management plans to implement initiatives; analyzing various restructuring proposals and providing advice; assessing implementation progress and recommending corrective actions; providing staffing benchmarks and performance measures; developing a change-management strategy including communications plans; assisting in the coordination and integration of change-management activities with other initiatives; providing benchmarking and best practices information; and providing advice on opportunities to enhance restructuring.  
It is believed that NAPA is uniquely qualified because of the background knowledge it has acquired about how NIH operates, and NAPA’s involvement in helping to improve the operations of the agency.  In addition, the inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for the remaining services that are needed.  Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this notice or by submitting a proposal.  The NAICS is 541611 with a standard of $6.0. Closing date will be 45 calendar days after publication. Any firms capable of responding to the government’s notice of intent must respond in writing by the response date as noted in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO).  Information furnished shall include enough detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.  All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor’s Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date.  If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non-responsive.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<CONTACT>MAJ ROBERT ALLARD, PROGRAM MANAGER, 719-556-2784 LT COL DOUG SMITH, CONTRACTING OFFICER, 719-556-6334
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. The Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) Office wishes to identify potential prime contractors for the MCCC Support Contract acquisition.  The purpose of the MC3SC acquisition is to award a contract to sustain, modernize, and provide operational support to the Mobile Consolidated Command Centers (MCCC) for USNORTHCOM and USSTRATCOM Combatant Commanders, and Joint Staff. The period of performance is anticipated to be mid FY06 - FY10. The MCCCs are comprised of tractor trailers enclosing a secure and HEMP hardened C2 network operations and communications center. The MCCC platform must be sustained to provide survivable and endurable command and control of strategic and space forces for situation monitoring, tactical warning, force management, force direction and decision support. In addition, this contract will provide for internal integration among the systems identified below, as well as for external integration of these systems with other C2 systems (e.g., MILSTAR, DSCS, GCCS, SBMCS, etc.). The objectives of are:  1. The contractor will serve as the principle focal point for interaction of MC3SC systems with "network-wide" C2 systems, such as those above, that are beyond the scope of this contract 2. Integration - Seamlessly integrate new mission capabilities with existing and evolving capabilities.  Ensure interoperability with other Combatant Commanders and component commands and assure flexibility to adapt to changing mission requirements.  3.  Mission Integrity - Assure operational availability and integrity of C2 functions while the systems are migrated into new systems and architectures.  This sources sought is being accomplished in lieu of a pre-qualification.  Subsequent industry feedback indicates that a formal pre-qualification process may not be necessary due to a manageable number of potential primes.  Consequently, the Government requests interested offerors to submit two (2) copies of a statement of their qualifications to CC2SG/PK, 1050 E. Stewart Ave, Bldg 2025, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-2902, Attn: Lt Col Doug Smith. Responses must be received NLT 1 Aug 05.  The intent of this sources sought is to identify potential prime contractors.  Sources interested in being a prime shall submit a qualification package that should not exceed ten (10) one-sided pages, 12 pitch font, one inch margins and include the following information regarding their ability to meet the requirements of a prime contractor on this solicitation: (a) Past experience, including migration to net-centric operations, on projects similar to what is anticipated for the MC3SC Contract and why you believe your company is capable of performing as a Prime Contractor,(b) Demonstrate your understanding of the problems that the MC3SC Contract must address and what potential risks you foresee that would preclude successfully achieving the objectives set forth in the first paragraph and (c) Demonstrated capability in HEMP hardened mobile systems, competency in the operations and sustainment of multi-level classified environments. Key competencies to be considered: systems engineering, program management, security management, logistics and test.  Offerors should indicate their ability to provide TS/SSBI cleared personnel upon contract award.  All work shall be performed largely at the Logistic Support Facility, 3825 Edith Blvd, NE, Albuquerque, NM 87107. Additionally, on-site support shall be required at the operational units located at F. E. Warren AFB, WY and Offut AFB, NB. The Government will assess prospective offerors' potential to be the MC3SC prime contractor based on the qualification packages provided.  Firms considered by the Government to be highly qualified to plan and execute the MC3SC program as a prime contractor will be contacted by the PCO and a list of such firms will be made available on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB).  Firms considered by the Government not to be highly qualified to plan and execute the MC3SC program as a prime contractor will be afforded an opportunity to receive the Government's rationale and provide additional information.  The Government will invite those firms deemed highly qualified to become actively involved in building the solicitation documents.  These documents will include, but are not limited to, the Statement of Objectives, incentive strategies, the evaluation criteria for award, and the evaluation standards.  Therefore, if the number of firms who identify themselves as potential primes in response to this sources sought prove to be excessive, the Government may decide to conduct a pre-qualification effort in order to realize a manageable number of firms deemed best qualified to perform the MC3SC effort.  Proposed subcontractors may participate with their proposed prime contractor in this document developing exercise.  Any interested firm initially judged as not best qualified as a prime will be provided a copy of the solicitation upon request.  Any offer submitted by such a firm will be evaluated without prejudice. Firms should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, whether they qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged, and whether they are an U.S. or foreign-owned firm.  A bidders' library will be available at the time of the source selection. Rules for access are posted on the HERBB http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil under "Biz Opportunities" and "MC3SC Support Contract."  Please note that HERBB will be the primary source of information for the MC3SC acquisition. Interested parties should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service for the "Mobile Consolidated Command Centers Support Contract." This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from interested firms during this phase of acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government official. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ESC Ombudsman is Lt Col Mark Mol,C2ISR Det 5/CC (719) 556-5500. The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have been brought previously to the attention of the Program Manager and/or Contracting Officer and could not be resolved satisfactorily at that level. Please direct any questions on the MC3SC acquisition to Maj Allard, Program Manager, 719-556-2784, email robert.allard@cisf.af.mil, or Lt Col Smith, Contracting Officer, 719-556-6334, email douglas.smith@cisf.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis for a 18-month contract with WE Upjohn Institute for Employment Research (Upjohn).  Upjohn will conduct a study to examine the extent to which former Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients across a number of states apply for and receive unemployment insurance (UI) benefits upon losing their jobs, as well as the reasons for disqualification among those whose applications were denied.  The analysis will also show the link between UI benefit receipt and TANF recidivism, and among state-level trends in unemployment, UI and TANF caseloads.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Upjohn is the only entity with access to the needed data and, is therefore, the only entity capable of performing the study within the required timeframe.  The study will require the use of administrative data with sufficient detail to analyze UI benefit application, receipt and denial.  The data must also contain sufficient observations to track the subgroup of former TANF families who have subsequently lost their jobs and then experienced a variety of UI benefit outcomes.  This necessitates the use of longitudinally-linked administrative records to combine files from the TANF and UI programs, as no existing survey data meets these needs.  Because program parameters for both TANF and UI vary across states, having data that represents more than a single state is crucial to the study.  Currently there is only one source of administrative data that combines records on both TANF and UI program participation across more than one state.  These data are maintained by the Administrative Data Research and Evaluation Alliance (ADARE).  ADARE was established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for the purpose of addressing the lack of interstate data.  ADARE is a consortium of nine state employment security agencies (ESAs) and, for each ESA, there is a research institute partner that is officially affiliated with that ESA for purposes of employment data processing.  The data are not available to the public, nor can they be analyzed by any entity outside of the ADARE consortium.  Within the ADARE consortium, each partner has been assigned the lead on a particular set of issues and associated data.  Upjohn is the partner that has been designated by the ADARE consortium and the DOL to analyze data pertaining to UI benefits.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing that they can meet the Government’s requirement within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole-source award to Upjohn.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541720.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Acquisition Division is seeking potential sources capable of providing professional services in support of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) role in evaluating and managing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and risk arising as a result of foreign ownership, control and influence.  The Government’s primary objective for the proposed acquisition is to obtain professional services to define, implement, manage and support DHS strategies, plans and operations to address risk posed by the foreign ownership, control and influence of U.S. critical infrastructure components.  A resultant contract would require at least the following key services: perform national critical infrastructure vulnerability and risk assessment; develop risk methodologies, theory and algorithms in support of a highly-classified, periodic report for high-level U.S. Government policy and decision makers; support policy and decision making in other related Government programs (e.g., FCC licensing and authorization of foreign telecommunications and information technology service providers operating in the U.S.); and provide long-term and trend assessments of the vulnerabilities and risks accruing from foreign operation, control and influence of U.S. critical infrastructure entities.  Activities will derive from the analysis and assessment of both open-source and highly-classified information sources covering the full spectrum of technological and other related activities in such fields as: aerospace engineering and production, biology, computers, defense systems, energy production, finance and investment, information technology, marine systems, microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, etc.  The short timeframes (30 to 90 days) permitted by statute and regulation to complete these activities require that sources employ or have immediate access to critical infrastructure specialists with expertise in all critical infrastructure and key resource sectors and have current TS/SCI clearances.  Specific tasks include, but are not limited to, preparation of research and analysis summaries and reports; developing and implementing program strategic and tactical metrics and supporting documentation; coordinating program efforts with Government and private sectors, development and use of automation tools to optimize program effectiveness; and developing documentation in support of program related goals, objectives and performance measures.  The proposed acquisition will be for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  This sources sought synopsis represents a market survey and is not a Request For Proposals or Invitation For Bids.  Interested sources are invited to submit a statement of capability to include company name, address, and point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, facsimile number, and business size (indicating whether you are a large or small business for purposes of the assigned NAICS code).  Written responses must be received no later than 14 Jul 05, 4:30 PM (EDT).  Responses may be emailed to the point of contact designated below.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the development and evaluation of the Sensing and Intelligent Decision-Making Capabilities of the Concept Demonstrators for Ageless Aerospace Vehicles. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), who is the only know responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  CSIRO is the only known vendor that possesses the customized, one of a kind concept demonstrator required for this effort.  CSIRO's approach includes a unique coupling of remote bond strength sensing with advanced telecommunications.  CSIRO has developed concepts under software simulation which have been implemented on a hardware platform.  It would take substantial duplicaton of time and money for another company to develop an acceptable approach and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested parties may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing   to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 11, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon the responses received to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been approinted.

<SUBJECT>B -- Analysis of Farm ExposureEstimation and LungBurden Measurements
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the University of Calgary, in the amount of $32,000 for follow-on analysis for Farm Exposure Estimation and Lung Burden Measurements. CDC believes that University of Calgary is the only organization that can meet the NIOSH requirements.
The University of Calgary has custodial property rights to the original data and lung tissues required for analysis and extension of the database developed in a previous contract. The University of Calgary has the demonstrated expertise required for these follow-on analyses, which include specialized lung tissue and particle analysis techniques and airborne particle exposure assessment in Alberta farmers.  University of Calgary and staff developed a database for NIOSH containing exposure and health effects data in a specific cohort of Alberta farmers and non-farmers; they also performed specialized analyses of lung tissues. 
This order is intended to build on data and analyses developed by University of Calgary (1)  developing a job-exposure matrix to estimate individuals’ particle exposures during farming, and (2) measuring the particle burdens in lung tissue, by both stereological imaging and mineral content analysis.  These follow-on analyses are intended to provide the complete data needed by NIOSH for a study investigating exposure, dose, and response relationships of inhaled particles, and evaluating lung dosimetry models.  
The follow-on analyses requires an in-depth understanding of the source data and the methodology used, as well as understanding how the additional analyses will be integrated to provide the complete data needed by NIOSH.  University of Calgary has the detailed understanding and expertise in the specific areas needed for the follow-on work, including numerous publications on these specific topics, and has demonstrated successful completion of the previous contract on which this follow-on work is based.  CDC believes that University of Calgary is the only organization uniquely qualified to perform this requirement.  Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide this service described above should submit a capabilities statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the service.
The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please send your documentation to Ronnie Francis at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or by e-mail to efi8@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion on of the government.

"TREATMENT PLANNING FOR IMRT" from the Report of the IMRT subcommittee of the AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee, Medical Physics, Vol. 30, No. 8, August 2003. --Verify that the Planning System (e.g., Pinnacle-3 RTP System) accurately models head scatter, penumbra, and transmission. --Inverse planning appropriately generates leaf-sequencing patterns for each field, and translates it to delivery instructions for the Linac. --Based on CT scans of cylindrical phantoms with regions of known electron density, determine the conversion from CT number to relative electron density for all CT scanners used by Radiation Therapy; --Check and verify the accuracy of the RTP Systems heterogeneity corrections using heterogeneous test phantoms; --Recommend how to handle contrast agents or streaking artifacts that may assign undesired CT numbers to voxels and inappropriately influence the dose calculations; and --Recommend which types of plans need heterogeneity corrections. --Evaluate the performance of the optimization (e.g., inverse planning) algorithms with respect to target dose uniformity vs. dose shaping (e.g., steep gradients) near critical structures. --Using cylindrical ion-chambers, small volume chambers in high dose gradient areas, and/or CR plate images, as appropriate, for a series of open fields on a flat phantom, confirm that the CAX PDD and off-axis profiles match expected values; --Apply a simple modulated shape to plans using gantry, collimator, and couch angles and translational shifts, and confirm that these geometric motions are properly implemented and understood; --For a series of simple intensity patterns (e.g., wedge, pyramid, or well), measure the dose/mu at multiple points in low gradient regions with an ion-chamber and MapCheck device, and dose profiles at multiple locations and directions with the CR plates and/or MapCheck, as appropriate; --Apply a simple intensity pattern to multiple beams (e.g., 5 to 7 axial beams) irradiating the flat phantom at different angles. This tests the planning and delivery for a summation of simple fields. Vary the central section intensities to test the planning and delivery over a range of conditions; --Design a series of tests of idealized targets in the flat phantom to be treated with multiple fields. Measure the dose with the ion-chambers, MapCheck, and/or CR plates, as appropriate; --Evaluate dose calculation accuracy in the presence of heterogeneities using simple geometry; and --Test simple and complex targets in heterogeneous and anthropomorphic phantoms. --Ion-chamber measurements in low gradient areas of single beams should agree with the plans to within 2% to 3%. For more complex irradiations typical of patient treatments, measurements in high dose, low gradient regions should agree with the plan to within 3% to 4%. --Develop an understanding of the dosimetric uncertainties so that clinical plans can be meaningfully evaluated, especially with respect to critical structures. Provide a detailed description to Radiation Therapy of these uncertainties. --Measure/provide any additional IMRT (e.g., Inverse Planning) data required by latest version of Philips/ADAC Pinnacle-3 RTP System (currently v.7.4). 7.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-5020. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-4 dated 6/8/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase approximately 1 (one) lot of custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips using the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix is compatible with the Affymetrix systems in place at Frederick, MD and Hamilton, MT. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six (6) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

CLAUSES: 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) - This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003); 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Oct 2003) –Tailored, and 52.247-34 F.O.B. Destination (Nov 1991). Upon request, the contracting officer will make their full text available.  Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this /these address(es):www.arnet.gov.  52.252-6 Authorized Deviations In Clauses. (Apr 1984). (a)  The use in this solicitation or contract of any federal acquisition regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(deviation)" after the date of the clause. (b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any [insert regulation name] (48 CFR [ ]) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(deviation)" after the name of the regulation. The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition. 52.212-4 Contract Terms And Conditions – Commercial Items (Oct 2003) --Tailored. This clause, 52.212-4 is tailored as follows.  Paragraph (t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is deleted in its entirety.  In lieu of paragraph (t), Contractors shall follow the requirements in the clause 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) - Deviation, which is incorporated in full text as an addendum/attachment to this order.  The following provisions at FAR Part 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (APR 2005) apply to this acquisition:  (b)(5), (b)(14), (b)(15), (b)(16), (b)(17), (b)(18), (b)(19), (b)(20), (b)(23), (b)(26), and (b)(32). 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003)-DEVIATION -- SSA is in the process of establishing the necessary interface between its financial system and the CCR database.  During this transition period, the agency is going to temporarily deviate from the requirement to use the CCR database as its source of information for EFT payments.  Therefore, this contract includes the clause at 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999) in lieu of the clause at FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003).  This is the only deviation from the requirements of this clause, 52.204-7.  The Contractor shall comply with all other requirements for CCR registration in the clause. This clause, 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) is revised to reflect this deviation.  The revised sections are shaded. (a) Definitions.  As used in this clause—Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by (D&B) plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.  (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)  This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that– (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active”. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2)The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS + 4 number that identifies the offeror’s name and address exactly as stated in the offer.  The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1)An offeror may obtain a DUNS number— (i)If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii)If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.  Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.  (g) (1) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name or division name, (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, the Contractor shall, after all of the requirements in FAR Subpart 42.12 are met and a novation or change-of-name agreement has been properly executed, change its name, and update its information in the CCR database.

1.0 Statement of Work
The Office of Coast Survey requires a precise navigation system for its existing Hydroid REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to continue evaluating the vehicle as an effective tool for hydrographic surveying.   The navigation system should include WAAS-enabled GPS and inertial navigation (INS) integrated into the vehicle and a WAAS-enabled GPS equipped acoustic positioning buoy system.

1.1 Background
The Coast Survey Development Lab Hydrographic Systems and Technology Programs is testing the use of  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) for use as a tool to conduct hydrographic surveys to augment the existing NOAA fleet of hydrographic survey ships and launches.  In FY04 a Hydroid REMUS AUV was purchased through a competitive process by OCS in partnership with NMAO to serve as a test and evaluation vehicle.  

Phase 1 testing of the vehicle was performed by OCS personnel during the FY04 field season (June-September 2004).  The primary goal of the testing was to build operational expertise with an AUV.  A secondary goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the vehicle’s navigation system for conformance to standards required for operational surveys.  The Phase 1 test results proved the viability of AUV’s as potential tools for hydrographic surveying.  However, the initial testing revealed that the navigation systems, as originally specified and accepted, would not meet operational requirements for hydrographic side scan sonar surveys (detection and positioning of a 1 cubic meter cubic target within 10 meters accuracy).

AUV’s are an emerging and rapidly developing technology, and in the time since the vehicle was specified and purchased significant improvements to AUV navigation and positioning have become available.  Specifically, the addition of GPS and an inertial navigation system (INS) to the REMUS AUV, along with the addition of GPS to the acoustic positioning buoys should increase the navigational accuracy sufficiently for OCS to continue its evaluation of this technology as a survey tool.

2.0 Objectives
NOAA requires that the existing Hydroid REMUS AUV (S/N 241) be upgraded as follows:

•	Integration of a WAAS enabled GPS receiver into the vehicle’s body and navigation system to allow for accurate positioning of the vehicle while on the surface to update the navigation solution of other onboard sensors, including acoustic navigation and Inertial Navigation System.

•	Modification of the vehicle’s end-cap to allow for integration of new sensors via guest ports.

•	Upgrade of existing Paradigm buoy acoustic positioning system to Gateway buoy system, including addition of WAAS-enabled GPS and acoustic communications on each of two buoys.  This will facilitate the accurate positioning of the acoustic navigation reference buoys and allow for the AUV’s navigation information to relayed back to the monitoring vessel via acoustic modem and radio.

•	Integration of an Inertial Navigation System (INS) into the vehicles navigation system.  This will allow the vehicle to accurately navigate between acoustic or GPS position updates.

•	Delivery of the modified vehicle will be no later than 6 weeks after the successful offeror receives the order and NOAA’s REMUS AUV.

Additionally, NOAA requires training on the new systems at the manufacturer’s facility to ensure correct and effective use and maintenance.  Training should be conducted concurrent with the delivery of the modified vehicle.

See below for questions and answers.

	
		

Question: 1) Is there a reason why you have mentioned Nissan X-Terra?
- The Nissan X-Terra is made for the US market only, and is not suitable for the African Continent. 
- There are no spare parts available for this specific model in Swaziland.
- The Nissan X-Terra does not comply with the specifications required for this country.

Question: 2) Does the engine have to be petrol engine, or is it possible to quote Diesel? 

Answer:  2 )A Petrol Engine is the only acceptable engine.

  
Question: 3) Does the vehicle have to be equipped with HAC(high altitude compensator)? As far as I understand, there are no petrol vehicles equipped with this?

Answer: 3) HAC is not required.


Question: 4) Will an AM/FM Radio/CD-Player be acceptable?

Answer:  4) Yes, an AM/FM Radio/CD-Player is acceptable.


Question: 5) Is it necessary to include a protection plate underneath the motor? 
 
Answer: 5) A Protection plate underneath the motor—if available.


Question: 6) Is it for a single vehicle or multiple vehicles?

Answer: 6) ADF is requesting one vehicle.


Question:  7)  We are confuses as the NAICS size for the solicitation is $24.5 Million.

Answer: 7)  Offerors are to use the NAICS size standard to determine whether it is a large or small business.  If the average annual receipts for the last three years is less than $24.5 million, the offeror should certify that it is a small business.

<DESC>This is amendment 0002.  Questions and answers could not be attached through Fedbizopps so they are provided herein as follow:

Q 1.) Are the items outlined in “Section III Tasks” minimum mandatory requirements, or would FEMA entertain a response from a contractor that was comprehensive, providing for 5 day, once a day news summariy coverage, yet not provide for 7 day coverage of news summaries?

A.1.) The tasks listed are minimum mandatory requirements.  While under typical operations , we only require five day (M-F) support, during periods of heightened disaster activity when our operations are functioning 24/7, the summaries must follow suit and expand to 7 days.  Its not a problem to deliver to one point of contact at FEMA, who would then deliver to the designated distribution list of FEMA officials.

Q.2.) How important is timeliness versus other requirements?

A.2.) We monitor wires for breaking news internally. Our primary requirement with this contract is to meet the need to provide daily summaries of media coverage to FEMA leadership.

Q.3.)  What are FEMA’s media priorities in terms of sources? (i.e. Can you provide a list of the major sources by media types that are “must haves”?)

A.3.) As part of the best value determination, we will look at the depth of sources that a contractor accesses.  We would like as much coverage as possible, bearing in mind that other considerations as well.  In brief, however, our media priorities in terms of sources would be a national print (both newspaper and magazines), broadcast and online media as well as local and regional print, as available, broadcast and online.

Q.4.)  How many FEMA employees would need access to the news summaries, full text of the articles contained in the new summaries and e-mail alerts, etc? How many outside of FEMA could potentially require these services?

A.4.) The news summaries, including full text of articles, are distributed daily to 165 FEMA employees.  We don’t currently use e-mail alerts, but would likely distribute to a similar number of employees, depending on the level of interest. We don’t currently distribute our news summaries/clips outside of FEMA>

Q.5.) Does FEMA currently have all of the capabilities as defined in the RFP for Media Clipping Services?

A.5.) We do not currently have the weekly summaries as described in part of task#3 (we do have the archive in that task, however,)
Q.6.) If so, Is it performed  by FEMA employees or is there currently a contractor that performs these services for FEMA?

A.6.) A contractor is in place.

Q.7.) How does FEMA intend to address copyright issues?

A.7.)  That would be worked out by the Contractor.

Q.8.) Is there a bidders list? If so, can it be made available to other interested parties?

A.8.) No, the RFP is on FEBIZOPP’s.

<SUBJECT>H -- Analysis of 1000 Urine Samples for Two PAH Metabolities and Two Oxidative Stress Markers
<SOLNBR>RFQ-NCI-50061-NV

<DESC>Amendment-01 for SOlicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV.  OFFERS ARE DUE IN THE CONTRACTING OFFICE JULY 30, 2005 AT 1:00 PM.


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure the analysis of 1000 urine samples for two PAH metabolites (1-OHP, 2-naphthol) and two oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, MDA). The services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance FAR 12  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541380, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

BACKGROUND:  PAHs have shown to cause mammary cancer in experimental animals. Some epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between breast cancer and occupational exposure to PAHs, active and passive smoking, and consumption of well-done meats which contains high levels of PAHs.  Although these are potentially important exposures for breast cancer, the evidence is not clear.  Exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies is based on information from interviews.  Measurements of urinary PAH metabolites in subjects with PAHs exposure in an epidemiological study would reduce misclassification of exposure and provide information on total PAH exposure.  Simultaneous measurements of 1-OHP and 2-naphthol would, therefore, provide better understanding of the total, as well as route-specific, PAH exposure and help clarify the relation of these chemicals with the risk of breast cancer.  There is growing interest in the role of oxidative stress from chemicals like these and breast cancer development because of cross-talk between oxidative stress and hormonal imbalance.  There are, however, a limited number of population-based studies of oxidative stress and breast cancer.  Among several biomarkers of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondiadelyde (MDA) are most frequently used because of their biological importance and the sensitivity of the assay.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall perform the following tasks on 1000 urine samples sent all at one time:  1) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 1-OHP;  2) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 2-naphthol;  3) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 8-OHdG; 4) Analyze 1000 urine samples for MDA; and 5) Provide results of the analyses in an Excel spreadsheet to the Project Officer containing sample ID, test-date, test results and if applicable, quality control data. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITES:  NCI will ship the 1000 urine samples on dry ice. Samples will be coded and will not have any personal identifiers attached.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Offers will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria.  The technical portion 	of the proposal will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  1)  Technical Approach – 50% proposed methods for measurements of urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biomarkers of oxidative stress must be sound and fully described.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to 1) provide Q&A and 2) extend the due date and time for proposal submission.  Accordingly, Amendment 0002 to SB1341-05-Q-0569 is issued as follows:


1.  Question:

Would the end user consider MCV(minimum condensed volume technology)?

Answer:

A minimum condensed volume (MCV) magnet does not meet the goals of this procurement because of the increased reliability concerns with respect to the leak-tight containment of the liquid helium cryogen. We reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of MCV in developing this solicitation. Over the years we have had a number of problems with vacuum integrity of the liquid helium circuit in our superconducting magnets made by various manufacturers. Repairing the vacuum integrity of these systems has been time-consuming, expensive, and occasionally impractical. Our research environment requires frequent relocation of the equipment and operation in spaces that can result in large magnetic forces, both of which are causes for additional stresses in cryogenic containment vessels. For these reasons this procurement is for a cryogen-free (no static liquid cryogens) superconducting magnet.


2.  Proposal submissions must be received by 2:00 p.m. EST on July 22, 2005.



All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation remain unchanged.
