<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled "Social and Economic Assessment of Major Oil Spill Litigation Settlement" for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region. The total period of performance for this project is twelve (non-consecutive) months, with an estimated cost range of $195,000 to $220,000. The period of performance for Phase One (Task Numbers 1-5) shall not exceed 6 months from the date of award. The period of performance for Phase Two (Task Numbers 6-8) shall not exceed 6 months from the resumption of fieldwork after Final Distribution of the litigation settlement. The offeror must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below. INTRODUCTION: The 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) event generated a tremendous amount of public concern about the ecological and social damage to coastal environments and local communities, but in contrast, relatively little attention has been focused on the likelihood of significant social impacts triggered by the post-spill restoration and litigation process itself. Analyses of data collected in spill-affected communities soon after the EVOS event report that existing social problems were exacerbated by the influx of spill clean-up monies and resources, particularly in rural Native communities where access to subsistence resources was diminished and options for alternative economic pursuits were limited. It is not hard to imagine that further disturbances (whether positive or negative) will occur at household, community, and regional levels of analysis as the long post-spill litigation process approaches an endpoint and the final definition and distribution of settlement awards becomes a reality.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY are to collect and analyze data on the major socio-economic consequences of the EVOS litigation settlement for residents of Kodiak Island Borough.  It will investigate and document the effects of the post-spill litigation process among different wealth strata of the population in both urban and rural communities to test the hypothesis that restoration monies and settlement awards will tend to amplify social, economic, and demographic trends and attributes of the awardees in all cases at household, community, and regional levels of analysis. The study will also attempt to formulate general recommendations pertaining to the effective management of potential future oil spills and related litigation settlement procedures.  These major goals will be accomplished through the following intermediary objectives and tasks:  Phase 1:  Compile and summarize existing data and scholarship regarding pre- and post-EVOS socio-economic conditions and trends on Kodiak Island. Continue to monitor annually updated public access data for regional level changes in demographic trends in Kodiak and an appropriate "reference" community throughout the study period. 2. Secure ethnographic research access from appropriate local authorities in two different Kodiak rural communities. Also secure ethnographic research access to the City of Kodiak. 3. Conduct ethnographic fieldwork in all three Kodiak locations. The fieldwork will involve community level participant-observation in relevant public forums, as well as open ended conversations with a minimum sample of 15 community residents (representing 15 different households) in each rural location and a minimum sample of 30 community residents (representing 30 different households) from the City of Kodiak. Thus, a total of at least 60 different households will be sampled across Kodiak Island during fieldwork. Each sample set should also capture equal representation from three different levels of socioeconomic strata: the high end, the median, and the low end (defined by local economic standards). The fieldwork is intended to gather information about how any settlement monies may have already been spent and how they are expected to be spent after a Final Distribution. It will also gather information about recent and expected changes in key socio-economic indicators such as: residency and migration patterns, occupational profiles, patterns of investment and return, specialization vs. diversification in commercial fishing operations, specialization vs. diversification in traditional subsistence activities, fiscal effects, and other selected social practices deemed relevant during preliminary research. 4. Conduct focus-group forums in all three fieldwork locations to supplement and compare with insights gained from step 3 above. It is expected that different community-level concerns and issues relevant to the litigation settlement process will surface in a focus-group forum that go unexpressed at household level conversations. The major purposes of the focus-group exercises are to a) probe for new and additional community-level information; b) review and collectively process major themes uncovered during fieldwork conversations; and c) test and refine major research hypotheses and questions. 5. Analyze the various data compiled above to develop a descriptive comparative analysis of the interim socioeconomic effects and expectations of the litigation experience in each community under investigation. Report the findings at the end of project Phase One (prior to Final Distribution of the litigation settlement). Phase II:  6. After a final litigation settlement is reached, conduct a second round of fieldwork to gather comparable data for the same categories of variables from all three communities. Analyze the data and report the findings at the end of project Phase Two (some months after the Final Distribution of settlement awards). 7. Produce a detailed written summary analysis that is responsive to the original hypothesis and research interests of the project. Report on major insights and general recommendations relevant to the effective management of future potential oil spills and related litigation and settlement. 8. Deliver a preliminary draft of an original scholarly paper about the project that will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. It is anticipated that this manuscript will be a condensed version of the Final Report and Technical Summary completed under Task 7 above, with perhaps a more explicit discussion of theoretical and public policy implications. HOW TO RESPOND:  In order to compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM, Monday, June 17, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:  (A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years. Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and four (4) copies to Sharon Teger, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817. Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia. Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on three criteria of equal weight: (A) Demonstrated experience and expertise of all key technical personnel, especially as regards social research and focus-group facilitation skills, preferably in Alaskan coastal communities. Skills and experience will be evaluated in light of specific tasks to be performed. Evaluation factors include: 1) length and quality of experience for each person assigned to perform specific tasks and analyses; 2) the level and quality of formal education in the disciplines and technical fields necessary, examining the level of relevant education attained as well as, honors, awards, and recognition of previous work; 3) experience conducting similar research and preparing similar deliverables; 4) demonstrated ability to complete assignments in a timely manner, and authorship in relevant peer-reviewed publications. (B) The Project Manager shall have: (1) experience and demonstrated leadership ability required for the coordination of the study process, (2) experience in managing a research team and the interdisciplinary processes required for this study, and (3) ability to control costs and to keep project performance and document preparation on schedule. (C) Demonstrated organizational history of successfully conducting projects of similar size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value; producing high-quality deliverables; and completing similar projects on schedule and within budget.  FOLLOWING REVIEW OF ALL CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS, we will establish a list of those offerors MMS has evaluated as most qualified to perform the work.  A written request for proposal (RFP) will then be forward to those offerors deemed most qualified, instructing them on the written portion of their proposals and possible oral presentation requirements. Questions should be faxed to Sharon Teger at (703) 787-1022 or e-mailed to sharon.teger@mms.gov.

<DESC>The Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee WA has a requirement to clean and rehabilitate six dewatering wells that are an integral part of the riverbank stablization system.  These wells are crucial to the ability to fluctuate the tailbay, therefore having a direct impact on hydro-power generation.  The cleaning process that we desire to use is injecting the wells with Carbon Dioxide which dissolves and dislodges the plugging materials from around the screen and gravel pack.  Afterwards, the wells are opened and flushed to further dislodge materials.  Conventional methods of cleaning these wells by use of chlorine and sulfamic acid has yielded negligible success.  At this time, we anticipate a sole source award to Water Recovery Services, 926 North Lake Road, Spokane WA because they are the only known licensed vendor of this patented process with the knowledge, ability, and equipment to provide this service.   All offerors must provide detailed information and specifications about their processes, equipment, and price reasonableness for adequate evaluation by the Government.  Any respondents should mail their offer and information as requested to: U S Bureau of Reclamation, PO Box 620, Code 7810, Grand Coulee WA 99133-0620.

<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms= .gov;
<DESC>This announcement (0403RP72818) solicits White Papers, of not more th= an five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Rural Bu= siness-Cooperative Service (RBS) of the Department of Agriculture Rural Dev= elopment, relative to obtaining independent third-party financial and techn= ical analyses of certain loan applications and loan servicing actions recei= ved by the Agency for complex, specialized and highly technical projects.  = These projects involve value-added processing energy generation, ethanol, a= nd other production bio-based products.  They also include commercial loanm= aking, especially feasibility study analysis, workout agreements, negotiati= ons, appraisals of specialized capital equipment, and resolving complex env= ironmental issues, and bio-based energy related projects. BACKGROUND:  The = Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program helps create jobs and stimula= tes rural economies by providing financial backing for rural businesses.  T= his program guarantees up to 90 percent of a loan made by a commercial lend= er.  Loan proceeds may be used for working capital, machinery and equipment= , buildings and real estate, and certain types of loan refinancing.  The pr= imary purpose is to create and maintain employment and improve the economic=  climate in rural communities.  This is achieved by expanding the lending c= apability of private lenders in rural areas, helping them make and service = quality loans that provide lasting community benefits.  Changes in the FY20= 02 Farm Bill, encouraging more technical loans, have created an additional = need for technical expertise in the B&I Guaranteed Loan Program.  RBS is, t= herefore, interested in receiving White Papers that define methods of suppo= rt that encompass all of the areas of external expertise necessitated by th= is Program.  RBS anticipates a total budget of up to $500,000 for these tas= ks and a potential level of effort of one-quarter to two person years of as= -required support, which could span multiple fiscal years.  ADDITIONAL INFO= RMATION: As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought=  and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be specifically=  related to the above stated issues. Multi-year funding of projects is acce= ptable.  HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers, not more than five (5) pages in len= gth, an original plus five (5) copies and one (1) electronic copy to be sub= mitted concurrently in pdf or Word format on CD or standard 3 =BD inch disk= ette shall be submitted to:=20 RICHARD P, BOLICK, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE/GovWorks, 381 ELDEN STREET, = HERNDON, VIRGINIA 20170-4817, not later 3:00 PM, EDT June 4, 2003.  WHITE P= APERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shou= ld define the proposed scope of support and include the level of effort.  N= OTE: COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED.  The White Papers shall be eval= uated only on technical merits.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS A COMBINED SOLICITATION - AND IS THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PROVIDED.  PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared under FAR Part 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this request. This requirement is for the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) wants to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical trial that might determine optimal doses and schedules of 2 agents used to support erythropoiesis in patients receiving chemotherapy.  Two agents that stimulate erythropoiesis are currently approved for the treatment of patients receiving chemotherapy who develop anemia.  Recombinant human erythropoetin (epoetin alpha, rHuEPO, Procrit, Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. Raritan, NJ) is indistinguishable from the endogenously produced human protein.  Darbepoetin alpha (Aranesp, Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) is a hyperglycosylated analog with 2 extra oligosaccharide chains at sites of amino acid substitutions, producing a higher MW agent with a longer circulating half life and somewhat decreased binding efficiency. In order to explore the most effective approaches to treating patients with agents that support erythropoiesis, NCI is requesting a contract to perform modeling and trial simulations. Given that the full surface of dosage regimenresponse patterns of the two drugs cannot easily be estimated by a single clinical trial _ indeed it may be impossible, due to the inherent complexities of the dosage regimens for maintenance and recovery periods _ NCI has determined the need for access to mechanistically oriented pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling to enable simulations of different dosage regimens of darbepoetin alpha and epoetin alpha that would predict the range of outcomes that an actual clinical trial might produce.  The goal of the modeling is to estimate the effects of varying the dose and schedule of each drug on clinically important endpoints and to estimate for various trial designs, the width of the confidence interval on the conversion ratio (the ratio of minimum total dosage per week of the two products, darbepoetin alpha and epoetin alpha, that provides a given level of clinical response [see below] in a specified fraction of patients with chemotherapy induced anemia). This modeling-simulation approach will (i) make extensive use of prior data that will be made available to the simulation contractor by both Ortho Biotech and Amgen in agreement with the National Cancer Institute and (ii) allow deviations from protocol to influence trial design, yielding more realistic estimates of design. The clinical response endpoints will be defined by NCI, and will be a weighted combination of clinically important endpoints (e.g., percentage of patients with an increase > 2 g/dL in serum hemoglobin [Hb] level at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 without transfusion, L, the lag time for Hb increase and rate of increase over specified intervals, mean change in Hb from baseline, percentage of patients who require red blood cell transfusions at various time points, etc.). The scope of work is described in detail in the Statement of Work, particularly in sections 3.0 (Scope) and section 4.0 (Specific Tasks). If you are interested in this acquisition, you may locate the RFQ instructions and statement of work documents on the following website: http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp The documents will be available on the govworks website in the late pm of May 20, 2003.  The documents are in Microsoft Wordr The solicitation documents (solicitation instructions and the statement of work) are located at: http://govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp, and identified as: RFQ 1435-04-03-RP-72743,  NCI PK/PD Modeling: Erythropoietin & Darbepoietin , National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis  Important Due Dates: 1.  Technical Questions Due:  June 03, 2003 no later than 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time.  No questions will be accepted after the June 03, 2003 date and time.

<SUBJECT>B--Beaufort Sea Anadromous Fish Overwintering Habitat
<SOLNBR>72732
<ARCHDATE>05192004
<CONTACT>Melissa Rountree Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.Rountree;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) plans to identify Beaufort Sea anadromous fish overwintering habitat. It will identify habitat using remote sensing techniques.  Conclusions will be verified by ground-truthing field work to detect fish presence or absence and the habitat characteristics.  The study is envisioned to be a 2 1/2 year effort.  The study results will be used to help evaluate and mitigate the effects of outer continental oil and gas development.  The most likely potential effects are hypothesized to result from oil spills or ice roads built to supply offshore oil and gas development.  BACKGROUND: Arctic coastal rivers and stream systems are productive aquatic habitats but anadromous fish use may be limited by the amount of suitable overwintering habitat.  Despite the likely importance of these areas in which fish must survive a minimum of eight months a year, the extent of overwintering habitat accessible to anadromous fish of the Beaufort Sea is not known.  Very little scientific knowledge exists on the location, characteristics, and variation of overwintering habitat.  Arctic cisco, Bering cisco, least cisco, humpback whitefish, broad whitefish, Arctic char, grayling, rainbow smelt, saffron cod, and four-horn sculpin are known to overwinter in deep pools of major rivers.  It is assumed that water just outside the shorefast ice is too saline to support overwintering fish because no ciscoes, whitefish or char have been documented to overwinter in Alaskan coastal waters.  However, recent oceanographic studies in Canada indicate conditions which might allow anadromous fish to overwinter in nearshore delta areas within or just beyond the shorefast ice.  Physically sampling all waters for overwintering potential is logistically difficult and expensive.  In past fish overwintering studies, diving and underwater video was found to be an effective but expensive sampling technique for identifying overwintering habitat.  MMS believes the cost of initial location of overwintering habitats can be reduced by using remote sensing technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and other satellite imagery.  Methods to identify unfrozen fresh waters could be improved by studying the shades of grey in SAR images.  Where overwintering habitat is brackish water, however, other remote sensing methods would be needed to help interpret SAR images.  The goals of this study are to use remote sensing technology to identify probable unfrozen habitat, then field verify whether fish use the identified habitats and describe the important habitat characteristics.  The field verification will also determine whether salinities are too high for anadromous fish just beyond (seaward of), and within the shorefast ice zone.  The study area(s)are to be representative of major potential anadromous overwintering habitat, including freshwater, brackish delta waters, and nearshore areas just outside the shorefast ice of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (145o-157o west longitude).  The technical aspects of this study include the following tasks:  Task 1) Stakeholder, Intergovernmental Coordination and Permitting.  The Contractor shall communicate with local residents, Native groups, commercial activities, and environmental interests to minimize local concerns, avoid disturbance to the subsistence use of resources, and maximize the use of local expertise and vessels. The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits in a timely manner for conducting the scientific program.  The Contractor shall also arrange to present the findings to key stakeholders and to MMS staff.  Task 2) Summary of Existing Knowledge.  Identify suspected or probable riverine, riverine-connected, delta, shorefast ice and brackish (seaward of shorefast ice) anadromous fish overwintering sites within five miles of the Alaskan Beaufort coast using local traditional knowledge, scientific and ?gray? literature, and other sources of information.  Collection of traditional knowledge is expected to include individual contacts or talking circle discussions with knowledgeable local residents who are paid for their time and expertise.  Task 3) Use Remote Sensing Data To Estimate Location and Amount of Anadromous Overwintering Habitat.  Remote sensing will be employed to identify overwintering habitat(in the form of sufficient unfrozen water) and plan timing and locations of field ground-truthing in the second and third years.  Activities to be considered by the contractor may include but are not limited to identifying three to five past years of satellite imagery, chosen on the basis of weather conditions and availability, to identify the range and variability in location of potential overwintering habitat and minimum habitat (maximum freezing) periods.  Remote sensing technologies to be considered in tasks 3 and 4 below may include, but are neither required nor limited to, review of current year satellite data, reconnaissance by aircraft radar, through-the-ice fish finder, underwater photography or other innovative technology to finalize location and dates of field verification.  The Contractor shall document how they are going to obtain the necessary satellite imagery.  We are currently exploring options with the National Ice Center (NIC) to provide, in our facility and at minimal cost, contractor access to the SAR imagery in current NIC archives from 1999-2003.  There is no guarantee that this agreement will be ratified by the NIC and MMS.  Task 4) Field Validation and Characterization of Anadromous Overwintering Habitat:  Fieldwork in Years 2 and 3 is anticipated to include, but is not limited to, use of state-of-the-art portable remote sensing equipment to confirm use of representative areas as overwintering habitat; identify species; estimate relative- and, (as far as practical) absolute-abundance and mortality; as well as hydrographic, physical or other habitat characteristics within habitat pockets during the late overwintering season.  Field work is to be restricted to potential sites for anadromous fish (i.e., at least seasonally connected to the river system) and likely to be affected by road building, potential oil spills or other development activities in connection with federal offshore oil and gas leases. The Contractor?s proposal shall recommend and describe a statistically defensible sampling design.  Task 5) Logistics and Permits: The Contractor shall be responsible for communications, field logistics, and transportation of supplies, equipment, data and samples to and from the field in a timely manner.  The Contractor shall specify appropriate logistics and safety measures compatible with proposed field methods under expected weather and ice conditions.  The Contractor shall coordinate with other ongoing studies to maximize scientific gain and minimize cost. The Contractor shall identify and adequately treat potential negative consequences of research activities in relation to local villages, subsistence activities, wildlife populations, wildlife habitats, and other natural resources.  Task 6) Data and Analysis:  All data collected will be analyzed to a) test the hypothesized overwintering locations and b) quantify the biological importance of the overwintering locations.   The estimated funding for this project is $480,000 but is subject to change and will be finalized at the time the Request for Proposal is issued.  The Period of Performance is estimated to be 30 months during FY 2003-2005.  The procurement for this solicitation will be in two Phases:  Phase I Capabilities Statements and Phase II Technical Proposal, Program Management Plan, and Cost Proposal.  Your Phase I CAPABILITIES STATEMENT must detail: (1) Your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience; (2) Your organizational experience and facilities including your organization?s experience and success in managing this type of work.

There will also be an option bid item for dredging one (1) additional foot of required depth.  The option bid item, if awarded, will be awarded prior to commencement of dredging.  The estimated total amo unt of material to be dredged in the base bid is 1 million cubic yards; and base bid plus option will be approximately 1.5 million cubic yards.

Drilling and blasting will not be allowed under this contract.  The disposal area will be located adjacent to the northern shore of Rockland Key.  Maximum distances from the dredging area to the disposal area will be on the  order of 15 miles.  An approved pipeline corridor (water route portion as well as overland portion) will be available to the contractor for placement of dredge pipe.  The contractor should expect that close coordination with environmental agencies will be  required when placing pipeline within the approved corridor so that impacts to environmental resources can be avoided.  The placement of dredged material will involve the partial filling of deep (underwater) borrow pits located at the Rockland Key site. It will also involve an upland site provided for the purpose of dredged material disposal.  The contractor will be expected to include a conceptual method and design for upland containment on the provided site as part of his proposal for this project.  In addition, the contractor will be required to show disposal area design details as part of the submittals required under the contract.  In general, the contractor should expect that a high degree of environmental sensitivity will be required of him by this contract.  This same level of sensitivity will be expected by the environmental community, which will be diligently watching the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s operations, especially with regard to turbidity.  In particular, the contractor should expect to work with re strictions such as areas of no access, areas where anchor placement is not allowed, and special requirements regarding the use of anchor cables, swing cables, mooring lines, etc.  The government intends to use the Request For Proposal method of procurement  for this contract.

Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Contracting Officer will use a trade-off process to determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are slightly more important than price. The following factors will be used to determine best value:  Technical Merit, Past performance, and Price.

Potential contractors are requested to provide information on: current products meeting the needs of the Air force, as described below; a no-cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM); and relevant history and evidence of past performance/capability.  As a minimum, all potential replacement recorders must meet the following criteria:  the recorder must fit within the maximum available space, 5.88 in. W x 4.75 in. H x 6.39 in. D; the power requirement shall be 28 VDC with a max power consumption of 30 watts; it shall be backward compatible with the current A-10 Heads Up display camera; as a minimum, the recorder should be capable of simultaneously recording two video channels (EIA RS-170 B/W or NTSC Color standard), two channels of audio, and two MIL-STD-1553B interfaces, with potential for future growth (i.e. 1760 bus interface, fiber optics, etc.) onto a removable mass memory device; record playback should utilize commercially available computer hardware and software; and the recorder shall also include, as a minimum, a 10-year warranty.  A Market Research Inquiry Day will be held, 17 Jun 2003, in the OO-ALC Contracting Directorate main conference room (Bldg. 1289), 0800 – 1200 with an opportunity for a “one-on-one” meeting with SPO personnel afterwards in the A-10 SPO Conference room (Bldg. 1284), 1300 – 1600.  Interested parties must contact the Contracting Officer, no later than, 4 June 2003 with their intent to attend.  Final vendor RFI responses will be expected by 30 June 2003.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Submarine Communications Program Office, PMW-173, intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC) for the production and delivery of ten SubHDR antenna systems, spares, Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA) Test Station components, and Time-and-Materials (T&M) engineering support services on behalf of PEO (C4I & Space) Submarine Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW-173). The SubHDR antenna system (OE-562) enhances connectivity with Joint tactical commanders and Battle Force commanders, improving Strike Warfare readiness, due to reduction in time to transmit critical mission updates. The SubHDR antenna system enables commanders to communicate with all capital ships in the Battle Force via a common, flexible communications structure including electronic messaging, full motion video and imagery, and enhanced digital voice. This antenna is required for the submarine force to utilize the satellite bandwidth that was placed in orbit from fiscal year 1998 through 2002 by Global Broadcast Services and Milstar.  The SubHDR antenna system provides a quantum leap in battle group connectivity from the current two-way 2.4 kilobits per second, to two-way 256 kilobits per second.  This enables the submarine force to actively participate in battle group operations, providing and receiving near-real time data using the Common Operational Picture, and provide imagery and data to support battle group missions. SPAWAR anticipates the award of an IDIQ/firm-fixed-price contract with quantity discount pricing and multiple ordering periods over the five (5) year life of the contract.  Quantities are estimated at two (2) HDR systems per year, one (1) IMA Test Station, one (1) spares kit per year and the option for eight thousand (8,000) hours of engineering and field support services per year. A SubHDR Antenna System shall be comprised of the HDR antenna system, a dip loop cable, junction box, hull penetrator and RAS kit. Delivery requirements are estimated at one (1) per month beginning fifteen (15) months after effective date of option exercise. Point of contact for this requirement is Mark Lopez, Contracting Officer, (619) 524-7168, mark.lopez@navy.mil See Note 22

Medical review boards update the OIES™ on a regular basis, guaranteeing that users have the most current information;  8) navigational tools specifically designed to enable the user to find exactly what they are looking for without having to read a lot of text; and 9) tracking software that monitors and records usage activity by user, machine, and OIES™ title.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The cur= rent version of the SOW is provided as a separate document under this Scree= ning Information Request (SIR).  If required, the FAA may revise the SOW in=  subsequent SIR releases. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, = involves the announcement/SIR 1 of the requirement.  The second phase (SIR = 2) will evaluate information gathered in SIR 1 as well as other factors ide= ntified in SIR 2.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this annou= ncement/SIR will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remainin= g phase(s) of the down select process will be identified in future communic= ations with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR. =20 The procurement action resulting from this SIR 1 is contemplated as a set-a= side for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Bu= sinesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the Small Business Adminis= tration (SBA) for participation in the SBA=19s 8(a) program at the time of = release of this announcement/SIR.

<DESC>NA The project work consists of dredging portions of Key West Harbor, including the Main Ship Channel,  Cut-A, Cut-A Widener, Cut-B, Cut-C, Cut-C Turning Basin, and Truman Harbor. The contract will be structured with a base bid for dredging to a required dept h of 36 feet with an allowable over depth of 1 foot.  There will also be an option bid item for dredging one (1) additional foot of required depth.  The option bid item, if awarded, will be awarded prior to commencement of dredging.  The estimated total am ount of material to be dredged in the base bid is 1 million cubic yards; and base bid plus option will be approximately 1.5 million cubic yards.  The general types of material expected to be encountered are silt, sand, and insitu rock.  The expected propor tion of rock could approach 40%.  Drilling and blasting will not be allowed under this contract.  The disposal area will be located adjacent to the northern shore of Rockland Key.  Maximum distances from the dredging area to the disposal area will be on th e order of 15 miles.  An approved pipeline corridor (water route portion as well as overland portion) will be available to the contractor for placement of dredge pipe.  The contractor should expect that close coordination with environmental agencies will b e required when placing pipeline within the approved corridor so that impacts to environmental resources can be avoided.  The placement of dredged material will involve the partial filling of deep (underwater) borrow pits located at the Rockland Key site.  The borrow pits are accessible by land only.  Placement of dredged material will also involve an upland site provided for the purpose of dredged material disposal.  The contractor will be expected to include a conceptual method and design for upland conta inment on the provided site as part of his proposal for this project.  In addition, the contractor will be required to show disposal area design details as part of the submittals required under the contract.  In general, the contractor should expect that a  high degree of environmental sensitivity will be required of him by this contract.  This same level of sensitivity will be expected by the environmental community, which will be diligently watching the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s operations, especially with regard to turbidity.  In particular, the contractor should expect to work with restrictions such as areas of no access, areas where anchor placement is not allowed, and special requirements regarding the use of anchor cables, swing cables, mooring lines, etc.  Th e government intends to use the Request For Proposal method of procurement for this contract.  The latest hydrographic survey (including sub-bottom profile data and side scan sonar images) is available at the following web site:  http://www.saj.usace.army. mil/conops/navigation/surveys/hydro.htm  Construction performance period is estimated 182 calendar days to 365 calendar days.  Defined period of performance will be included in the solicitation.  Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100 ,000,000.00 (This includes the Base and the Option).  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Contracting Officer will use a trade-off process to determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are slightly more important than price.  The following factors will be used to determine best value:  Technical Merit, Past performance, and Price.  The solicitation will be issued on  or about June 6, 2003 and proposals will be due on or about July 22, 2003.  Solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.  Interested offerors must register electronically.  The registration form is located at https://ebs1.saj.usace.army.mil/ebs/ AdvertisedSolicitations.asp.

In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

If the Contractor does not feel the survey can be completed safely, the Contracting Officer or their Representative shall be contacted immediately.

There is increasing recognition in the field of the need to identify these competencies and to structure education and training programs for the workforce around the development of these competencies.  The knowledge base regarding workforce competencies remains in an early stage of development.  The concept of competencies is usually not well defined.

The anticipated period of performance for this simplified acquisition is for 20 months.  Interested Small Business organizations, HUBZONE Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Business, 8(a) Small Business should submit and original and two copies of their capability statement.  Will not accept e-mails or facsimiles.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

<DESC>This is a request for information(RFI)and not a request for proposal(RFP). The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has the mission of supporting the acquisition of Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services (EMSS)for Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD U.S. Government agencies.  The intent of this RFI is to obtain market information and determine capabilities of all businesses with the infrastructure to support Equipment purchases and airtime services for DoD and non-DoD Agencies. Information is being sought to provide DoD with a hand-held global satellite communication service that includes voice, data, paging, and FAX capability and provides for expansion for other potential mobile/stationary user equipment configurations, including secure voice and data communications. EMSS provides voice, data and messaging services to Government and Government-authorized subscribers. These services are tied to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) through a Government owned and operated ground station. The Contractor shall ensure that EMSS equipment and airtime services are provided to the Government in a manner consistent with its most favored commercial subscribers for the same commercial service. The Government is interested in minimizing recurring costs to EMSS users while maximizing the utility of the EMSS capability. Lower recurring costs will generally increase the number of users financially capable of using the service.

The Government is interested in receiving answers to the following questions with regard to EMSS services:

1)	Describe the current satellite marketplace specifically in respect to how your company fits into the market; 
2)	How will the EMSS services be priced in comparison to the commercial market;  
3)	Describe your communications infrastructure and area of coverage.  Specifically identify Global coverage from 90 degrees North to 90 Degrees South;
4)	Identify type of satellite equipment used (model, manufacture, type, and technical specifications);
5)	Provide pricing for any MSS services you provide based upon your current price list for commercial customers;
6)	Provide a representative listing of customers to whom you are currently providing satellite services;
7)	Describe what control, if any, you have over the pricing of the satellite services and equipment you provide.
8)	Discuss physical and communications security you're your space and earth segments;
9)	Describe any National security Agency-approved encryption devices that are compatible with your handsets for voice or data traffic;
10)Do you have 2 ground stations capable of leasing
   secure  space to DoD in the U.S;
11)Are Virtual Private Network (VPN)-like capabilities
   in place that could segregate DoD traffic from
   commercial traffic; 
   12)Identify current aviation, marine, scientific,
   homeland security, or military applications your
   services are currently being used for;
   13)What is the subscriber capacity on your space and
   earth segments;
 14)Provide detailed call route diagrams for various
   handset to handset to terrestrial calls;
   15)Discuss how system users can be directly connected to
   the DISN through DoD classified and unclassified data
   networks and the Defense Switched Network (DSN)
   terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure. Include
   a discussion of relevant security issues.

NOTE:  All information received will be kept in the strictest confidence and only used internally by the contracting officer.  It will not be released or shared with any other government agency or any government contractors.  FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation For Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) applies to this RFI. 52.215-3(c) Add the following: Information will be used to assist in planning and development of acquisition strategy by DISA and AQN4 for eventual procurement of these services.

AQN4 will use this information to gain an understanding of mobile satellite services provided.  Interested companies should submit as comprehensive a package as possible. Note: The Government understands vendors may not be able to respond to all requested information, as such, the Government will accept partial responses to this RFI. RFI packages shall be delivered in paper copies and soft copy (MS Word 7.0 or higher), three (3) copies each. RFI packages are due to DITCO/AQN4,Attn: Randolph Grey, 701 Courthouse Road, Arlington, VA.22204 NLT 4:00 p.m. EST, 10 June 2003.

<DESC>NA The US Army Communication and Electronics Command (CECOM) is soliciting information from potential sources for the design, development, fabrication, integration, and test of a Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload for the Army Future Combat System (FCS) Un manned Air Vehicle System (UAVS) or the Army Extended Range/ Multi-purpose (ER/MP) Tactical Unmanned Air Vehicle (TUAV).  The primary SIGINT payload mission will be to electronically map Radio Frequency (RF) emitters that operate within the High Frequency (HF) to Super High Frequency (SHF) ranges on the battlefield.  The SIGINT payload shall include intercept, direction findi ng (DF) and geo-location capabilities.  The SIGINT payload shall be comprised of two components; the (SIGINT Payload on the air vehicle and the Ground Control and Processing Subsystem.  The SIGINT payload should be less than or equal to the FCS UAVS or ER/ MP UAV payload capability of 60 lbs, with a growth path via a modular payload to a fully functional payload at 130 lbs. The Ground Control and Processing Subsystem shall remotely control the sensors on the air platforms, and shall preprocess and display lo cation data. The Ground Control and Processing Subsystem shall be integrated into the Distributed Common Ground Station Army (DCGS-A). The Ground Control and Processing Subsystem must comply with the standards and interfaces established for DCGS-A. The deg ree of processing performed by the SIGINT Payload and the Ground Control and Processing Subsystem is left to the discretion of the vendor. The SIGINT payload shall comply with the Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA).  The concept is for SIGINT Payloads mounted on UAVs to operate in pairs to perform the electronic mapping function; however the system must provide for single UAV operation, in which the system would provide line of bearing data that could be used for geo-l ocation as the aircraft flies. The contractor will be required to provide a payload limited to the 60-pound requirement, and volume and form factors suitable for the Class III UAV.  The contractor will also be required to show how the payload capabilities can be expanded, in a modular f ashion, as the weight and volume limits are raised to the 130 pounds and volume capabilities of the Class IV UAV.

<DESC>NA MARKET SURVEY (not a solicitation for bid)  Market Survey and RFI on RF MEMS and Ferroelectrics Phase Shifters for Phased Array Antennas The U.S. Army RDE command, Research and Development Center, Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate, is conducting a market survey to determine the identity of companies and soliciting White Papers that address the Army Manufacturing Technology (M ANTECH) Program for Affordable Phase Shifters for Phased Array Antennas. The US Army is interested in developing sources for advanced technologies, designs, fabrication techniques, materials, and packaging concepts that can be applied to the large scale ma nufacture of RF Micro-Electro-Mechanical Switches (MEMS) and ferroelectric phase shifter components.  The purpose of the MANTECH Program is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will advance the current state-of-the-art of RF MEMS/ferroelectric phas e shifter devices and increase the cost effectiveness of these devices and related components for the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s development of low cost phased array antennas for SATCOM on the move applications. The U.S. Army RDE command is looking for potential sources to take part in a Mantech Program for affordable phase shifters for phased array antennas.  This Mantech program will address both Ferroelectric and MEMS based phase shifters in separate efforts.  The program will be a multi-year effort with phased deliver ies over the duration of the effort. OBJECTIVE: The Army is pursuing technologies to meet transformation goals of a lighter, faster, more lethal force with integrated on-the-move communications from sensor to shooter.  Affordable Phased Arrays provide the means for this high data rate on-the-move commun ications.  The cost of phased arrays is dominated by the current high cost of packaged MMIC phase shifters.  MEMS and Ferroelectric phase shifters provide a low cost option for these costly items. MEMS and ferroelectric phase shifters will reduce size and weight, power consumption and cost of phased array antenna systems.  The primary objective of this effort is to produce low cost phase shifters with a total packaged cost of less than or equal to $10 minimum, less than $5 objective, with a loss less than 4  dB and operational switching life greater than 10(12th power) cycles.  Systems utilizing these phase shifters are planned for 18.5-21.2 GHz, 27.5-31 GHz and 43.5-45.5 GHz. INFORMATION SOUGHT: This market survey is soliciting technical white papers for the development and demonstration of manufacturing technology processes to enable the low-cost production of MEMS or ferroelectric phase shifters for phased array antennas. The objective of this e ffort is to develop sources to provide products that meet the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s performance reliability, and cost requirements.  Attainment of this objective should result in the ability to produce low-cost (less than $10), MEMS/Ferroelectric tactical grade phas e shifters suitable for DoD weapons systems. Additionally, the phase shifters should withstand the environmental requirements associated with a tactical battlefield.  The offeror should have an understanding of the goals and missions of the DOD Manufacturing Technology Programs with a major emphasis on affordability, life-cycle-cost, and technology transitioning to industry. Accordingly, the white paper should address i n sufficient detail the necessary areas of process improvements that are critical to achieving the above mentioned program goals and objectives, specifically phase shifter cost drivers. Current state-of-the-art and baseline capabilities should be thoroughl y discussed, including manufacturing process improvements required to achieve affordable MEMS/ferroelectric methodology.  Key factors to be addressed, but not limited to, are; a.	Detailed design of MEMS or Ferroelectric phase shifter b.	Detailed fabrication methods/techniques c.	Technical barriers d.	Methodology for overcoming technical barriers and as sociated Risk e.	Packaging f.	Operational Frequency g.	Loss h.	RF power handling capability i.	Power consumption j.	Switching speed k.	Maximum hold down time l.	Operational Lifetime (# switching cycles) m.	Operating Environment n.	Cost of packaged devices (for various quantities and yields) The overall scientific, technical, engineering, and manufacturing approach to meeting objectives and technical requirements should be addressed including; the degree of organization's technological advancement in MEMS/ferroelectric phase shifter component development; background and experience in MEMs or ferroelectric development and manufacturing; listing and description of relevant facilities and equipment (and their location) that would be used during the conduct of this effort. Package design and fabric ation processes must be considered for high volume, low cost phase shifter integration into phased array antenna modules. In addition, this market survey is soliciting MEMS or ferroelectric phase shifter sample devices/materials. The government will conduct independent testing and evaluation of the MEMS devices and materials provided under this effort. Offerors should be prep ared to supply to the Government samples of the devices or test structures that are identical (i.e. from the same lot) to the ones they are using to assess process maturity, device reliability, RF performance, and/or failure mechanisms. Additionally, the g overnment may use government owned or independent laboratories to test and evaluate sample MEMS or ferroelectric materials/devices. In addition, each manufacturer should include license and data rights being offered. Interested companies should submit their white papers and sample devices/materials to the Technical POC below NLT  27 Jun 2003.  An unclassified meeting for all interested U.S. manufacturers of MEMs/Ferroelectric phase shifter devices/materials will be held on Jun 9, 2003, at Booz Allen & Hamilton, 151 Industrial Way East, Eatontown, NJ 07742 (note: no visitor authorizations reqÃ¢Â€ Â™d), from 0900 to 1500 hours. Attendees are required to pre-registrer. Participants who do not pre-register will not be allowed into the meeting.

TOPS is a server-based application (Intel Platform, Sol aris 8 O/S) that requires the clients to access their TOPS server via Secure Shell (SSH), emulation VT220.  The TOPS system, which is a 14-year-old proprietary client server system, is running in a Solaris 8 environment.  TOPS provides a multi-service (Arm y, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corp, Coast Guard), standardized, personal property management information system for DoD.  The evolution of the automated TOPS reduces the manual administrative workload associated with preparation, control, and distribution of documents and maintenance of registers, rosters, and files relating to personal property activities. The standardization of TOPS improves the coordination and control of personal property movement and storage procedures at the lowest possible cost, and enh ances the management control and quality of personal property information.  TOPS provides personal property shipping offices worldwide-automated capability for the following processes: counseling service members and DoD civilians of shipping entitlements, routing and booking of shipments to commercial carriers for movement, store members shipments short-term and long-term, scheduling the pickup and delivery of household goods and baggage, ensures that shipments are reviewed for quality assurance, process bi lling to the multiple finance centers, transmits data from origin shipping offices to destination shipping offices, and supports multiple interfaces with external systems. TOPS supports the yearly shipping of about 600,000 DoD personal property shipments w orldwide.   The application must meet the following requirements; it requires advanced data security with Secure Shell (SSH, port 22) support so that all data exchanges between the terminal emulation client and the remote Solaris server to ensure that all data is fully encrypted and secure; application must be Windows 2000 compliant; it will support access to the TOPS application via the (TCP/IP) Non-Classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (NIPRNET) or LAN; printing functionality is required via th e same session connection; terminal emulation sessions will remain intact during printing; it will offer ease of use for the systems administrator with minimal training; it must be FIPS 140-2 compliant or pending evaluation.  That product that Ã¢Â€Âœpendin g evaluationsÃ¢Â€Â must identify when their products were submitted for evaluation, what LAB, and estimated date evaluation is to be completed.  Minimum information required is Vendor Name, Full Mailing Address, Telephone Number, FAX #, Point of Contact ( POC) Name, POC email address, Crypto module Certificate Number, Validation Date, Name and Version Number of the Product.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Memo of Understanding (MOU) to work with a ROPS manufacturer to design, test, and evaluate the marketability of the automatically deployable rollover protective structure (AutoROPS) for farm tractors that NIOSH has previously designed and tested.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of operators of farm tractors by bringing AutoROPS-equipped tractors into the marketplace. This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the AutoROPS a profitable safety product.  Present ROPS are limited because some tractors are regularly used for both low-clearance (cleaning barns, orchard work, etc.) and unrestricted-clearance operations.  A rigid ROPS cannot be used on tractors that perform such dual operation.  Manually adjustable ROPS have been developed, but these rely on the operator to raise the ROPS to its protective position.  There is currently no form of passive protection, such as the AutoROPS, available on dual-use tractors for protecting operators from fatal injury in a rollover.  The telescoping AutoROPS developed by NIOSH is normally latched in its lowered position for day-to-day use.  If an overturn condition is detected by the sensor, the retracted ROPS will deploy and lock in the full upright position before ground contact.  Static load testing and field upset tests of the AutoROPS have been conducted by NIOSH in accordance with Society of Automotive Engineers standard J2194.  Additionally, timed trials of the AutoROPS deployment mechanism have been completed.  The results of these tests show that the AutoROPS is a viable device that could be used to help prevent deaths due to tractor overturns. Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, may be evaluated by their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the AutoROPS into commercial production.   NIOSH does not promise to sign an MOU with any presented company. While no party promises purchasing or testing, the right is reserved to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. AutoROPS Commercialization Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) (A) Providing significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing the AutoROPS.  This would include defining the cost and usability needs of a target, dual-use tractor market.  Also, assistance will be given in setting realistic product cost objectives and providing suggestions on how the AutoROPS can achieve product cost goals - Required; (B) Fabricating  prototypes for test and evaluation - Required; (C) Providing expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations involving farm populations - Required; (D) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications - Required; (E) Reviewing testing methods and recommending appropriate, new testing criteria - Required; (F) Working with a tractor OEM to provide NIOSH with a tractor so that the SAE J2194 static load and field upset tests can be conducted – Required.   NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas. A company that is qualified and currently is producing ROPS for farm tractors is highly desired. However, past testing and design of AutoROPS is not required. If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided. Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.) Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement. Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period. Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety. Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged. The government has identified July 16th and 17th, 2003 for these presentations to be conducted. The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms as defined by NAICS Code 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting), to provide operational and administrative support for the NIMH Constituency Outreach and Education Program (COEP).  As described on its Web site, http://www.outreach.nimh.nih.gov, this contract enlists Outreach Partner organizations from all 50 States and the District of Columbia, along with national organizations, in a partnership to increase public awareness of mental health issues. This Program is a key element in the broader effort by NIMH to deliver science-based information on mental health to the public, health professionals and other key stakeholders, and thus to improve the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses among all Americans, including underserved populations such as minority groups, people living in rural areas, children and older people.  Specifically the Contractor will be expected to: 1) support, improve, enhance, and broaden the current collaborations; 
2) provide administrative and logistical support, technical assistance, and resources to the Outreach Partners, including training (through annual meetings and teleconferences), as well as possibly developing and distributing mental health educational materials 3) provide communications to the Education Network and Expert Panel, as well as support for activities to connect them with the Outreach Partners; 4) provide electronic communication resources, including web site maintenance/development and listservs; 5) provide Program monitoring and evaluation to determine if collaborations are effective and are meeting NIMH's objectives; and 6) improve and increase outreach to minority and other populations, to help eliminate mental health disparities due to race, culture, age, gender and other factors.  The resulting contract will be "performance based" (also referred to as Performance Based Contracting (PBC)).   The elements of PBC are:  1) performance requirements/tasks; 2) performance/task standards; 
3) method of surveillance/measurement techniques; 4) performance indicators; 5) positive and negative incentives/award fee structure.  The method of surveillance also incorporates use of an award fee evaluation group. Capability statements furnished should demonstrate: (1) professional qualifications of specific personnel (and the organization) in providing mental health based outreach efforts (2) your specific experience and qualifications to perform each aspect of this Contract (outlined above); (3) your firm's status as a small business under NAICS Code 541611.

<DESC>The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Tri-Laboratory community (LLNL, Sandia, LANL, and DOE Office of Science), is seeking sources to gauge the interest of industry and the open source development community in pursuing open source development efforts aimed at needs of the High Performance Technical Computing community in general and the NNSA Advanced Simulation  and Computing (generally known as ASCI) Program in particular. We intend to stimulate development in specific high performance computing areas. In addition, we request information from the industry and open source development communities on efforts outside of our predefined areas that may be of mutual interest.


Review the OSSODA Request for Information (RFI) at http://www.llnl.gov/asci/pathforward_trilab/rfi_rfp.html for further information. 


Inquires or other responses may be submitted via email to Gary Ward at ward31@llnl.gov

The open source development methodology has yielded significant enhancements to the state-of-the-art in operating systems (c.f., Linux OS) and tools (c.f., Apache). Multiple accretions of open software mass have resulted in profitable enterprises that combine these tools into single offerings with support. In addition, there exist many efforts to build clustering tools (c.f., LLNL Chaos, LANL Clustermatic, Sandia CPLANT, NPACI Rocks, OSCAR, and others) that extend the desktop environment to medium and high-performance computing.

The NNSA Tri-Laboratory community has been participating in open source development efforts. Prior to the advent of open source community development methodologies, the Tri-Laboratory community made significant contributions to computer science via public domain release of operating systems, code development tool chains, and applications.

The NNSA Tri-Laboratory community recognizes that open source software is not "free." The cost structure is just different.  This concept is described in more detail in the RFI.  In addition, it recognizes that to be a full member of the open source development communities, financial and effort contributions are required.

<SUBJECT>B -- Meeting to Discuss the National Weather Service plans to collect,  distribute, and archive WSR-88D Level II data; Silver Spring, MD.  June 18, 2003
<DESC>The National Weather Service (NWS) will host a one-day meeting in Room 2358, in the Silver Spring Metro Center (SSMC2), 1325 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3283, beginning at 8:30 am (Eastern) on June 18, 2003.  The meeting discussions will focus on NWS plans to collect, distribute and archive WSR-88D Level II data.  The NWS plans the following meeting objectives:

1.  The NWS will describe the proposed architecture for electronically collecting and distributing WSR-88D Level II data;

2.  The NWS will describe the proposed NWS implementation schedule;

3.  Current and prospective non-NEXRAD agency users of real-time Level II data will be asked to comment on the proposed NWS architecture;
 
4.  Comments will be solicited on how the private sector may wish to redistribute Level II data, given the NWS-proposed architecture;

5.  The NWS will discuss the decision-making process and how the information gathered from this meeting will be used in finalizing the Level II distribution architecture and distribution policy; and

6.  The NWS will attempt to answer questions that may arise during the meeting with respect to distribution of Level II data.

The NWS plans to electronically collect, distribute and archive  Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) Level II data in near real time.  The NWS will use this approach to archive these data at the National Climatic Data Center and provide the data for operational use at the National Center for Environment Prediction Centers.  The NWS plans to make these data available to external users (users outside the NEXRAD Program).  

The NWS Level II data collection network will use NWS Net and the Internet2/Abilene network in a collaborative approach to transport these data to users.  The NWS data collection network will be implemented in a two-phased approach: 

1.  Leverage the successful Collaborative Radar Acquisition Field Test (CRAFT) Project by supporting continued CRAFT operations; adding data compression/data manager PCs at NWS sites that are not a part of CRAFT; and connect these additional sites to the NWS data collection network by the end of 2003; and 

2.  Install the required compression and data manager software on WSR-88D systems and connect select CONUS DOD WSR-88D sites to the data collection network by the end of 2004.

The agenda for the proposed meeting will be at the following URL:  http://www.roc.noaa.gov/NWS_Level_2/.  Recommendations for agenda items, objectives, and other comments/questions should be sent to:  tim.d.crum@noaa.gov.

People planning to attend the meeting should send their name, organization, email address, and phone number to tim.d.crum@noaa.gov by June 16,2003.  This will assist the clearance of visitors through the SSMC2 security check point.  You may attend the meeting without prior notice, but may encounter delays in clearing security.

<SUBJECT>99 -- U.S. COAST GUARD IMPLEMENTS FEDTEDS
<DESC>In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the U.S. Coast Guard is implementing the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS provides users with a method of securely transmitting and disseminating sensitive acquisition material related to solicitations found on FedBizOpps.gov.  While this information is required to prepare a vendor’s proposal, it is often sensitive, particularly when aggregated with information available in other areas of the Internet.  Examples of sensitive acquisition related information include drawings and plans of Federal buildings, telecommunications, ship dry dock schedules, boat boarding procedures and continuity of operations.  FedTeDS allows for real time on-line vendor access to this sensitive acquisition related information while complying with the requirement to tighten access to sensitive data.  FedTeDS provides a layer of security by validating the requestor’s identity with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and maintains a record of individuals receiving the data.

Vendors seeking business opportunities with the U.S. Coast Guard are encouraged to first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov) and then with FedTeDS (www.fedteds.gov).  As the U.S. Coast Guard implements FedTeDS sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information will no longer be available through the government-wide point of entry (i.e., FedBizOps).
