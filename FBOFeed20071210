<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Performance Technologies to supplement its Advanced Managed Platform for the following reasons: The Flight Service and Weather Engineering Team (AJW-176) is in the process of re-hosting the Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) Data Acquisition System (ADAS) to a new architecture. Part of the new system requires that new hardware be deployed at the FAA's Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) to connect the existing weather sensors, (that utilizes the legacy High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol) to the FAA's Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) Internet Protocol (IP) network.   An engineering study was performed and the document "Enhanced ADAS Operational Sensor Support Capability" V0.6 Dated 4/24/06 was created. This document discusses the technology and the evaluation process for the type of devices (generically known as protocol converters) that support data sent over the serial HDLC communication links and encapsulates that information so that it can be transmitted over an IP network. After extensive research and review it was determined that Performance Technologies (PT) had the best solution that meets and exceeds the ADAS specification. Their product line (the Advances Managed Platform) provides a hardware solution that offers a high port density in a small form factor. The AMP5091 offers a modular I/O platform that supports up to 56 ports in a 4U 19" rack mounted chassis. In addition PT's hardware solution is based upon hot-swappable I/O modules and power supplies.  Note, Each I/O module supports 8 ports that require two 4-port Hydra-cables.   Purchase of 12 platforms was made in September 2006.  The FAA has a requirement to purchase an additional 10 platforms and intends to do so through Performance Technologies, Inc.  Based on the above, Performance Technologies is the only source with the product to meet the HDLC protocol solution for ADAS. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any responses to this announcement must be directed to Lori McLaughlin, Contracting Officer, by 4 p.m. Eastern Time, December 17, 2007.

The Government is not required to delay contract award to review pending Source Approval Requests (SARs). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs as soon as possible. If the Government has not completed review of the SAR when the contract is awarded, the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible Source Approval for future awards.  If an offeror's SAR package is approved, and since a first article will be required, the solicitation will be amended to include first article line items and clauses. For qualification information or source approval request, please contact OC-ALC/SB (405) 739-7243. The only available source is Pratt & Whitney, East Hartford, CT. 06108 cage code 52661. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s)listed. NOTE:  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from the offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose for the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program manager or the contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendation to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER SOLICITATION REQUESTS.  Notes 13, 22, 23, and 26 apply.  Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Raytheon Company, 1847 West Main Road, Portsmouth, RI 02871-1087 for a continuation of basic research for the development of unique mathematical and statistical algorithms.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has requested that the Raytheon CAD/CAC algorithms be adapted to a variety of systems and demonstrate this capability over the next several years. Only Raytheon has the unique knowledge base, the facilities, and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.  The key personnel have invested over nine years in gaining the unique knowledge, insight, and skills necessary. Additionally, the algorithms developed by Raytheon represent many work years under other Raytheon/DOD contracts and Raytheon's own independent research and development (IRAD).  The algorithms are very sophisticated and require specialized knowledge to use properly thus an!  other vendor cannot easily or cost-effectively duplicate them.  Results will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered!   solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitiv e procurement. NAICS Code:  541330, SBA Size Standard:  $25M, FSC:  R425.

<DESC>The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), operated by Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA), Inc. with the U.S. Department of Energy for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory, herewith solicits your competitive technical and cost proposals to provide research and development effort on a prototype internal mechanical support structure for the PHENIX Forward Silicon Vertex (FVTX) Detector. 

PHENIX Collaboration at Brookhaven National Laboratory intends to award an R&D contract to a firm for engineering work on a prototype internal mechanical support structure for the PHENIX Forward Silicon Vertex (FVTX) detector. The tasks include revision of the existing design for the prototype structure and fabrication of the prototype structure. The design revision and prototype production will be used to verify the cost of the final internal mechanical structure and to reduce manufacturing risk. An additional task is to perform an engineering study of the design on the FVTX support disk to identify potential cost savings through design optimization.  

The vendor performing this job must have experience working with large channel count, silicon sensor detector systems for particle physics and space-based experiments. They must have a demonstrated track-record of design of mechanical support, cooling and alignment systems with micron-level precision and multi-project experience designing and prototyping carbon composite-based low mass mechanical support systems. The vendor must also have significant experience working on advanced technology mechanical engineering projects for the US Department of Energy. Familiarity with the specifications and design of the PHENIX experiment, especially the PHENIX silicon vertex detector systems is highly desirable. This project will require weekly interaction and close coordination with engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.

Only interested firms with the aforementioned experience and capabilities are encouraged to submit a proposal.
 
The contract awarded as a result of proposals submitted in response to this announcement is considered to be the result of competition to the maximum extent practicable.  BSA reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  BSA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this announcement will not be returned.  It is the policy of BSA to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the process of evaluation.  BSA is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the engineering design study for the PHENIX FVTX Detector. All prospective offerors shall submit an initial technical and cost proposal, detailing the firm technical capabilities, comparable engineering design work study history, assets, and availability.  Capability statements must demonstrate qualified available personnel with the pertinent experience, adequate organizational and administrative structure, and demonstration of resources necessary to perform the work.  Capability Statements that do not provide sufficient information will not be considered.  The cost proposal must include cost estimates for all tasks to be performed under the resultant contract.  Prospective and qualified offerors are encouraged to submit technical and cost proposals by noon (Local Upton, NY time on Dec 19, 2007.  It is anticipated that one contract award will be made as soon as possible after review of all technical and cost proposals.  The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal.  Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation.  Selection of a proposal for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Btookhaven National Laboratory weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.  

All proposals are to be submitted electronically to the attention of JoAnna Lovett-Black at jblack@bnl.gov by noon (local Upton, NY time) on December 19, 2007.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Ionsense, Inc., 999 Broadway, Suite 404, Saugus, MA, USA, 01906-3823.  FDA will purchase one AutoDART-96 minus DART 100 and five (5) packs containing 96 DIP-it? Samplers.  The AutoDART-96 system will be used in the development of rapid methods for the detection of contaminants in complex food and food contact material matrices to support counterterrorism, food safety, and regulatory work, as well as to assist in the characterization and development of other food safety/security bio-sensors. The instrument in question must be capable of robotically transferring (using a pipette-like mandrel) plastic pipette-tip holders configured with glass capillary rod tips, from their pipette tip containers to solid or liquid samples arranged in either: 1. a 96-well format, or 2. a programmable X,Y,Z co-ordinate; and then
robotically move the sample into a target ~6 cm2 ionization zone at programmable rates and hold times, prior to sampling tip disposal. It must also have the capability to perform these programmable sampling maneuvers in repetition or with sequentially changing positions, samples, speeds, and hold times. The system must utilize contact closure outputs in its communication with the data-acquisition system of the incident mass spectrometer to permit saving data from the introduction of each sample into separate data files.  The AutoDARTTM is a peripheral accessory to the DART-100 ionization source, which is solely manufactured and distributed by Ion Sense, Inc. There are no other commercially known DART ionization sources available and therefore no other commercially available auto-samplers can be configured for use with the DART ionization source. There are no other commercially available systems which are manufactured for operations with the DART-100 ionization source.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive offers.  However, all offers received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sources intending to provide submittals must submit detailed information indicating their ability to meet the Government?s requirements.  All inquiries must be received by 2 PM (1400) EST on 26 December 2007 to the attention of David Kordel, david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for services regarding DNA Methylation Aberration and Prostate Cancer Risk among U.S. farmers in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) with The University of Milan, Via Festa Del Perdono 7, Milan, Italy. 

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard in $11M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.

The purpose of this proposed contract is to investigate the role of 1. CpG island promoter region methylation in 5 steroid hormone receptor genes (AR and ERa-A) 2. Global DNA hypomethylation by examining two repetitive elements, i.e., Alu and LINE 1, in relation to prostate cancer risk among U.S farmers in the AHS.  Contractor requirements: 1) Perform bisulfite treatment of 2000 buccal cell DNA; 2) Perform PCR amplification and pyrosequencing for global methylation analysis estimated in Alu and LINE-1 sequences on 2000 buccal cell DNA; 3) Perform PCR amplification and pyrosequencing for methylation analysis in the promoter area of the following genes: AR and ER?-A; 4) Obtain all necessary local approvals (IRB and administrative office) to receive the 2,000 samples shipped in dry ice for the proposed analysis and for tracking and timely reception of the samples as soon as they arrive; 5)  Review all designs and procedures with the NCI project officer or a designated NCI investigator on the project and obtain final approval before carrying out sample processing;  6)  Deliver results for global DNA methylation within six months and for gene specific methylation within 12 months of the contract award using computer software designated by NCI; 7) Prepare a technical report on details on the standard operative procedures used in DNA extraction, bisulfite treatment, PCR amplification, and DNA methylation analysis.  The report shall also include an inventory of the number of DNA aliquots obtained from each of the tissue samples. Quality control methods and results shall also be specified in the technical report.

Period of Performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.

The Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, University of Milan, Italy, has acquired the expertise and resources necessary to apply epigenetic techniques to epidemiology studies.  For DNA methylation analysis, the laboratory uses pyrosequencing technology on bisulfite treated DNA to quantitatively measure global or gene-specific methylation. This technique has sensitivity and accuracy to detect very small changes in DNA methylation, such as those that may be of interest in epidemiology studies. EPOCA is the only Institution worldwide to have Pyrosequencing equipment completely dedicated to environmental health-related research. The laboratory implements standardized QC/QA procedures that take full advantage of the pyrosequencing potential. In particular, QC procedures permit to accurately determine whether bisulfite treatment, a critical step in DNA methylation analysis, resulted in complete cytosine conversion. The University of Milan is the only source known to the NCI that can provide this service.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm ET on December 27, 2007 to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RFP DTFH61-07-R-00154

The following questions and answers are provided:

1. Question 1. On page 10 of the solicitation the phrase ?full time equivalent? is used in describing the two full time (equivalent) Research Assistants/Associates.  Can this staffing approach (using more than one person to staff an FTE) be used with other staffing positions, such as the Mid-Level Psychologist?

Answer 1. Yes, for Mid-Level Psychologist, but not for Senior-Level Psychologist

2. Question 2. Page 50, Subcontracting Plan, states that, ?The offeror shall state that there will be subcontracting, or that the offeror has determined that all work will be done in-house? and therefore, no subcontracting plan would be required.  However, page 55, Part IV discusses the section devoted to SDB participation and page 64 discussed how the SDB participation would be evaluated.  Would not having an SDB mean that all points would be lost for that item?

Answer 2. No points are assigned to the SDB factor. However, the SDB Plan is evaluated in the source selection process.

3. Question 3. Is 10 point equivalent to 12 cpi in the proposal?

Answer 3. Yes

4. Question 4. Can tables/charts use a smaller font?

Answer 4. Yes.

The following amendments are made to the solicitation:

1. Attachment 3, DATE FOR RECEIPT OF OFFER is changed From: Jan 8, 2008

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement for written information only.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  In preparation for a future procurement, The Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC) Engineering Service Center (ESC) is seeking the technology to capture and control carbon dioxide emissions from a peaking power plant using algae.  Toward this end, commercial providers of this technology will be identified. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, will be scrutinized and regulated in the near future.  California has already passed into law AB32 which will require a, ??greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions levels in 1990 to be achieved by 2020.?  The Mari!  ne Corps owns a 7.5 megawatt, natural gas-powered peaking plant which is located in the Mojave Desert and subject to future GHG regulations. A feasible solution is to capture the carbon dioxide emitted from the plant using algae.  Carbon dioxide emitted from the power plant will become the source of carbon for the growing algae.  The algae can then be used not only in carbon sequestration, but also as a feedstock in biodiesel, syngas or power production. Respondents should provide the following information about their carbon sequestration technology:  Name and address of company, company point-of-contact with phone and fax number (email address if available), narrative description of their process, a process flow diagram, and potential reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In the process narrative, NAVFAC ESC is particularly interested in information regarding operation and maintenance costs of the algae system.  There should also be sufficient detai!  l to allow the government to determine the state of development of the  technology and its suitability for a funded demonstration.   Responses to this announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives.  This announcement is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The applicable NAICS codes are 423730--air pollution control equipment, merchant wholesalers--and 333411--air purification equipment manufacturing--with a size limitation standard of 500 employees.  Interested sources must submit any comments and information via email to casey.barker@navy.mil no later than 20 January 2008.  Responses received after this deadline may not be considered.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

<DESC>OFFADD:  AFCA/ENSE, 203 W. Losey St, Rm 2000, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222
SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
POC:  Capt Richard Olcott, 618-229-6328 / Analyst
DESC:  This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis and market research.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The government is currently conducting a market survey of government-off-the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf products that can meet the requirements outlined in this RFI.

1.0	PURPOSE.

Our objective for this RFI is to collect information on Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) discovery and assessment tools.

2.0	BACKGROUND.

The Air Force needs to determine the availability and maturity of software tools that can perform IPv6 discovery and readiness assessment.  The Air Force has implemented manual processes to determine the IPv6 readiness of its network devices, but has interest in an automated tool that can perform the function to reduce workload.

3.0	HIGH-LEVEL DESIRED CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION.  

Specific capabilities would include:
  - Scan the user's network and discover the devices connected to the network
    -- Routers
    -- Switches
    -- Hubs
    -- Hosts
    -- Servers
    -- Printers
    -- Other network devices

  - Query those devices for their configuration information
    -- Manufacturer
    -- Model
    -- Operating System Version
    -- Configuration

  - Based on the response to the query, generate a report detailing the IPv6 status of the discovered devices
    -- IPv6 incapable
    -- IPv6 upgradeable via software or hardware (new card)
    -- IPv6 capable but not enabled (not turned on)
    -- IPv6 capable and enabled   
    -- Basis for IPv6 determination
        --- Vendor literature
        --- DoD IPv6 Approved Products List
        --- IPv6 Logo Program
        --- Other sources

If the results of the quick study indicate that the tools are available and mature, the procurement for such a tool will be considered for the Air Force.

4.0	INFORMATION AND PRODUCTS SOUGHT FROM VENDORS.

The deliverable of this RFI is identification of a tool (or set of tools) with a description of each product?s capability to support IPv6 discovery and assessment.  The description of each product should identify how the tool queries the network devices, to include the ports and protocols used and any necessary device configuration requirements for responding to queries.  The tool must be able to identify network infrastructure devices or network attached devices as described in Section 3, above, and describe their IPv6 capable status.  Currently, we know this is provided as a service using proprietary databases.  However, the Air Force needs a self-contained software tool.  The tool must be capable of discovering IPv6 capable devices in near real-time and reporting that information to any applicable stakeholders.

5.0	FORMAT FOR SUBMITTAL OF RFI.  

The format for submitting responses to this RFI is outlined below:

5.1	Pages 8.5 x 11 inches in size, single or double spaced, margins not less than one inch all around, one-sided printing, pages numbered, in at least 10 point type;

5.2	The title page shall be limited to one page and clearly labeled ?RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Number.?   It shall also include the date of submission, the RFI response title, GSA contract number, area(s) addressed by the response, plus respondent?s administrative and technical points of contact along with telephone and facsimile numbers, electronic mail address (if any), and signed by an authorized officer;

6.0	SUBMISSION INFORMATION.  

Vendors responding to this RFI who currently have products available are requested to provide descriptions of concepts within 30 days after the posting date of this notice.  GSA contract is preferred.  Potential vendors may express interest, make comments and ask questions via electronic mail or fax comments or questions to the Air Force Communications Agency, Emerging Technology Analysis at AFCA.ENSE@scott.af.mil, FAX (618) 229-5544.  All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, e-mail address and telephone number.

A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition.  This procurement is to obtain the CareTracker supportive documentation system developed for extended care/long-term care facilities for use at the Grand Island, NE facility.  Care Tracker offers soft software.  The program is completely configurable by the organization for the organization.  As documentation requirements change, the organization can change the requirements.  CareTracker does not mandate the facility to use specific MDS software.  CareTracker is able to integrate with a number of MDS programs including the VA AccuCare Program.  CareTracker offers and recommends documentation through a kiosk system.  The system is flexible to incorporate hand held devices.  The kiosk system is easily used by front line staff with minimal training.  The kiosk system is durable with minimal repair needs due to use by multiple staff.  CareTracker is not limited to just nurse aide documentation.  The program has the flexibility for interdisciplinary team documentation.  The system also provides care alerts to professional staff as conditions change.  The organization has the ability to determine the alert format and notification process.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, December 17th, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (402) 449-0612.

When can we come and see the condition of the signs to determine initial repair needs? There are no initial repair needs; the signs are operating normally at this time.
What is the bidding format? A flat rate for the year?  Yes, a flat rate for one year, with 4 option years.
How are we to determine how often these units will require standard, possibly monthly service? This contract is meant to provide for ?as required? service in the event that the marquee signs breaks down or in-operational. 
How are we to determine how often these units will require emergency service? If this could be determined it would not be emergency service, it would be scheduled service. 
I saw an ad for this project on a government site. You list the sign manufacturer as Autocom but we cannot find out who they are.   Do you have any more information? Model #, description of the signs, sizes etc.  It is an LED Message Displays in Full Color, 28mm pitch, Part Number:  128-56X80RGBMPEG2, supported by Ethernet communications kit.  Signs are manufactured by Optec Displays, Inc, Model # 2848-R2G2B1, Matrix: 56 X 80.
There's not enough information in this solicitation. Do you just want an hourly rate for standard service to be charged on an on-call basis? Also, an emergency or after hours hourly rate?  We?re asking for a flat rate for one year.  Contractor can be called in for number of times to fix the marquee if it breaks down during the contract year.  Please note parts are covered for replacement under the warranty of 5 years (marquee systems were installed on 7 Feb 07).
