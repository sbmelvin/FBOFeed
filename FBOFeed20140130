The Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond to the RFP. This presolicitation notice does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF WORK: This effort is for the acquisition of Joint Service Equipment Wipes (JSEW), which may either be a commercial or non-commercial wipe technology, that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination. The JSEW will be capable of producing a quantifiable reduction in gross chemical contamination while maintaining the functionality of equipment. This capability will significantly enhance how the Warfighter executes immediate, operational, thorough, and clearance decontamination for chemical agents. JSEW addresses known issues with current decontaminants, which are corrosive and damaging to optics and electronics, by allowing the Warfighter to effectively maintain operational effectiveness of contaminated sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates awarding one (1) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract on a Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) basis for a majority of the effort, but will also include some Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and COST basis for limited services. Funds are presently not available for this acquisition. The applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this solicitation is 325998 All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing and the small business size is 500 employees.

Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the RFP. It is the responsibility of those respondents to obtain all amendments and applicable documents.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CARDIOVASCULAR MRI SERVICES.
<p>Note:  This synopsis follows a Small Business Sources Sought notice that was released on December 18, 2013 under Sources Sought number HHSN-NIH-NHLBI-SBSS-013.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has a need to obtain support services to improve the diagnostic quality and patient experience of pediatric MRI and improve the patient safety of cardiovascular interventional procedures through the use of the radiation sparing and superior tissue visualization properties of MRI.  <br />An important goal of NHLBI is the dissemination of new diagnostic techniques and treatments developed at the NIH. The Institute is committed to seeking out patient groups that would benefit the most from such new techniques. Since cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) can be performed without the use of ionizing radiation, it has some inherent advantages for the pediatric patient population, who are especially sensitive to radiation. However, the area of pediatric CMRI has traditionally been difficult to enter for the NHLBI due to a limited opportunity for pediatric patient recruitment at the NIH. Consequently, the NHLBI has sought to form strategic partnerships with pediatric hospital centers to provide pediatric patients with access to state-of-the-art cardiac MRI and to provide the NHLBI scientific teams with access to a broad range of problems and cases to enable further improvements of novel treatments and techniques.</p>
<p>The NHLBI has determined that the best setting for deployment and development of new techniques is a combined X-Ray MRI (XMR) suite located at a facility with a large pediatric patient volume.  The purpose of this acquisition is for the contractor to provide a facility with an XMR suite and to provide staffing and professional services needed to support the contract.</p>
<p>THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS MAY SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The standard classification NAICS code is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services with a small business size standard of $14.0 million.</p>
<p>NHLBI plans to award one (1) cost-reimbursement, option-type contract with a one-year base period and four (4) one-year options.  Source selection will be based on a best value trade-off evaluation. <br /> <br />This is a presolicitation notice only, and not a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about February 14, 2014 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site. Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. There is no written solicitation available, telephone requests will not be honored, and no bidders list will be maintained.

<DESC>NSN 7R-1660-015600206-V2, REF NR 2311134-1, QTY 16 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. &nbsp;During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers. &nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>Source Sought Notice for: Methyl Bromide Soil Fumigation Services
<p>This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is for small businesses only.<br />The purpose of this sources sought notice is to determine the interest and feasibility of small business set-asides. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor will the U.S. Government pay for information solicited. The information from this notice will help the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Procurement Branch, Minneapolis, MN plan their acquisition strategy or plan.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Administrative Services Division, Procurement Branch located in Minneapolis, MN , is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, including small business set-asides, small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), 8(a) small businesses, woman-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), and Historically Under-utilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses capable of providing Methyl Bromide Soil fumigation services in Southeastern Idaho.<br /><br />All responding small business firms are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business to the anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code. For this acquisition, the NAICS code is 115112 and the Small Business Standard is $6.5 million. Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered based on the Government's market research, provided the prime contract is awarded to an applicable small business and that small businesses provide fifty one percent or more of the support.<br /><br />The USDA APHIS MRPBS ASD under ASD Procurement Branch is conducting market research to identify sources that have the combination of experience in: <br />1. Soil Fumigation using Methyl Bromide<br />2. Continuous tarp applications (complete coverage)<br />The effort will consist of treating an estimated 303 acres of crop land near Shelby Idaho with the fumigate methyl bromide (methyl bromide 80% chloropicrin 20%) to support the Pale Potato Cyst Nematode Eradication Program (PCN). The contractor will be required to supply all required supplies, materials, equipment, labor, supervision, safety equipment, personnel, services, tools, transportation, secured storage of fumigant, and sufficient workforce to complete the contract in the specified time (13-18 operational days, not to exceed 35 days inclusive of weather delays). <br /><br />The Contractor will be responsible for the application of the fumigant, perforation, and removal of the plastic from the treated areas after fumigation, and approved disposal of the plastic. Removal and disposal of used plastic must be done in a manner that will substantially minimize movement of soil out of the treated fields. Plastic must be disposed of in a municipal landfill (the nearest is ~25 miles from the fields to be fumigated) where it will be secured by deep burial. The used plastic must be transported to the approved disposal area in enclosed containers. Tarps must not be perforated until a minimum of 5 days (120 hours) have elapsed after the fumigant injection into the soil is complete, unless a weather condition exists which necessitates the need for early perforation or removal. Tarps may be removed before the required 5 days (120 hours) if adverse weather conditions have compromised the integrity of the tarp, provided that the compromised tarp poses a safety hazard. Tarps may also be perforated before the 5 days (120 hours) for flood prevention. Adverse weather incudes high wind, hail, or storms that blow tarps off the field and create a hazard. A compromised tarp is a tarp that due to an adverse weather condition is no longer performing its intended function and is creating a hazard. The Contractor will be responsible for operating within the applicable federal and state regulations for PCN, including subjecting all personnel and equipment that come into contact with soil regulated for PCN to the requisite sanitation treatments. All equipment and vehicles used inside the PCN-infested fields or within a proximity that presents a risk of PCN spread must be pressure washed to remove all soil before leaving the field, followed by steam-sanitation under a tarp for one hour at 140&deg;F. From start to finish, both pressure washing and steam sanitation treatments may take 3-4 hours per piece of equipment. Sanitation must be conducted by PCN Program personnel, and services will be available only when adequate natural lighting and weather conditions permit. <br />The previous contract was awarded to Trident Agricultural Products, Inc and was a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) type contract that fumigated 316 acres.<br /><br />Please submit the following information:<br />1. Name and address of company and or companies (if there is a teaming arrangement or joint venture)<br />2. Technical expertise relevant to the requirement<br />3. Technical approach relevant of the requirement<br />4. Management approach relevant to the requirement<br />5. Corporate experience relevant to the requirement<br />6. Relevant past performance, including:<br />&bull; Contract name<br />&bull; Contracting Agency or Department<br />&bull; Yearly contract value (in $)<br />&bull; Period of performance<br />&bull; Description of work and how it relates to the requirements<br />Submission requirements:<br />1. Page limit - eight (8) 8 &frac12; x 11 pages<br />2. 1 inch margins (top, bottom and sides)<br />3. Times New Roman font - 12 point<br />4. Page limitation does not include (1 cover page or 1 letter of introduction page)<br />5. Do not include promotional materials<br /><br />Interested small business firms responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Governments requirements for the above in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b). The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not exceed eight (8) pages TOTAL, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. The Government technical team will then assess the experience &amp; capabilities based on: 1) technical expertise relevant to the requirement; 2) technical approach relevant to the requirement, 3) management approach relevant to the requirement, 4) corporate experience relevant to the requirement, and 5) relevant past performance. Please specify one primary and one alternate Point of Contact (POC) within your firm, including telephone numbers and email addresses<br />Your capability statement needs to include a list of three customers (Government/non-Government) within the past 5-years highlighting similar work in nature, scope, complexity, and difficulty and a brief description of the scope of work.</p>
<p>Only electronic copies of capability statements will be accepted and should be emailed to: Jason.l.wilking@aphis.usda.gov. The e-mail shall contain the following subject line: Response to Sources Sought Notice - Methyl Bromide Soil Fumigation Requirement. A determination by the Government to proceed with the acquisition as a set-aside is within the discretion of the Government. If capability statements are not received from at least two (2) responsible small businesses or if the Government determines that no small business concerns are capable of performing this requirement based upon an assessment of the capability statements submitted, the Government may proceed with a full and open competition.</p>

The following requirement is set-aside for small business concerns.  However, if we are unable to prequalify at least 3 small businesses to ensure competition, the prequalification process will become full and open. 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC), located in Pomona, NJ has a requirement for construction.  The project includes the provision of all labor, materials and equipment to replace the roof and mechanical equipment of Building 287 at the WJHTC and all incidental related work.  The work includes the removal and replacement of approximately 4,800 square feet of roofing over three roof levels and the removal and replacement of the building mechanical components.  The mechanical components to be removed and replaced are the boiler, air handling units, chiller, fan coil units and test cell exhaust units, and all associated work piping, wiring and controls.

The FAA anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract in the beginning of April. Award of this requirement will be made to the responsible lowest price, technically acceptable offeror.  

The performance period is expected to be 270 calendar days, following the issuance of a Notice to Proceed. 

This procurement will be done in three phases.

Phase I  INFORMATIONAL ONLY Preliminary Drawings are attached (Attachment I); the preliminary drawings outline the scope of the envisioned work.  This broad scope is to give vendors an idea of the size of the project and the resources it will require.  It is meant to be informational only.  Also attached to this posting is a list of pre-qualifications (Attachment II).  Vendors interested in being considered for this requirement must respond to the pre-qualifications, and submit their responses in writing to nicole.saiauskie@faa.gov no later than 12:00 p.m., February 14, 2013.  

Phase II  Once all of the pre-qualifications have been collected, they will be evaluated by the program office on a pass/fail basis.  Vendors must meet all of the requirements under Factors 1, 2, and 3 in the pre-qualification criteria to be considered technically acceptable to move on to the next phase.

Phase III  The FAA will invite all of the pre-qualified vendors to a site visit, at which time final drawings and specifications, and a complete Request for Proposal (RFP) Package will be distributed.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in attendance of the site visits or preparing responses to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with the site visit or response to the RFP is solely at the interested vendors expense.

All potential vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management website (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) for consideration of this award.

Potential sources are cautioned that further public announcements may not be made and the RFP along with SOW documents will only be released to the qualified vendors invited to the final site visit.

Questions about this announcement must be submitted in writing to nicole.saiauskie@faa.gov  no later than February 6, 12:00pm (local time).  A question and answer period regarding the bid documents will open at a later date.

Please review Attachments I, II and III to ensure a proper understanding of this requirement.  Also, please complete the Business Declaration (Attachment IV) and return it with the Pre-Qualification submission.

Attachments:
Attachment I  INFORMATIONAL ONLY Preliminary Drawings
Attachment II  Pre-qualifications

<CONTACT>Crystal G. McCoskey, Phone 8705437267, Email crystal.mccoskey@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of small businesses to provide genome sequencing services using an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is&#8208; 541380, Testing Laboratories; Small Business Size Standard is $14.0 million.</p>
<p>Part I: General Information (Introduction/Background/Scope)</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research for the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for genome sequencing services. The NCTR is conducting a study titled, "The Sequencing Quality Control Project, MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Phase III, - Sequencing-based Technologies for Safety Evaluation of FDA-regulated Products". The study requires human whole-genome DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) sequencing services on an estimated 10-20 human DNA samples, using an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform, to accurately evaluate the performance and utility of the next-generation sequencing platform in detecting human genetic variation including Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), short Insertions and Deletions (Indels), Copy Number Variations (CNVs), and large Structure Variations (SVs). The resulting variants call data will be used to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and robustness of each Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform compared to those detected with microarray-based genotyping approaches from the MAQC-Phase II project which evaluated Roche 454, ABI SOLID 5500,and Affymetrix platforms. This phase of this long running project is specific to evaluation of the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to identify human genome variation sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p>Part II: Work Requirements<br /><br />The FDA will provide the initial samples (estimated between 10-20; to be determined at award based on price with a total award amount not to exceed budgeted amount of $150,000) to the Contractor within 180 calendar days of order date by NCTR researchers. The Contractor shall assess the quality of each DNA sample using fluorometric-based methods including Qubit or PicoGreen to provide accurate quantification for double-stranded DNA. The ratio of absorbance at 260 nanometer (nm) to absorbance at 280 nm shall be used as an indication of sample purity; the acceptable ratio of absorbance shall be in a range from 1.8 to 2.0.The quality verification results shall be sent electronically to the Project Officer (PO) for review upon conclusion of the initial quality screening. Any samples that fail the quality assessment shall be returned for replacement. Any necessary replacement samples will be provided within 7 calendar days of the receipt of the quality verification results.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide library preparation services using the Illumina "TruSeq DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-free Sample Preparation Kits" from 2 microgram (&micro;g) input genomic DNA. The insert size shall be approximately 550 bases.<br />The sequencing image data obtained from the HiSeq2500 shall be transformed to fastq data files and aligned against the Human Genome reference HG19 (from the University of California, Santa Cruz) which can be found at: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/. The aligned files shall be in Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) format. The genome coverage, or sequence depth, for each sample shall be no less than 50 times (x). The genetic variants shall be analyzed using the standard parameters contained in Illumina's default software. The variants shall be recorded in Variant Call Format (VCF).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide one (1) hard and one (1) electronic copy of all sequence data (including fastq files, BAM files, and VCF files) to the PO within 120 calendar days of receipt of all required samples meeting the quality standards listed above.</p>
<p>The contractor shall return, via method (i.e. expedited, protective packaging, temperature control) that maintains the integrity of the sample during shipment, all samples, including those returned unprocessed as a result of quality verification failure, to NCTR upon completion of the analysis.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is soliciting information to conduct market research regarding the current-state-of-the-art in robotic and human satellite servicing and repair in low earth orbit (LEO).  NASA would make spacecraft and payload interface data available to parties interested in pursing ideas for satellite servicing in LEO.  NASAs ultimate goal in sharing these data is to encourage development of commercial capabilities to service and repair satellites.  This goal should have synergy with public-sector goals. <p> This is an RFI only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take further action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA, nor the Government, will be responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. <p> NASA envisions both human and robotic activities for servicing and repairing satellites in LEO that need fuel, repair, or instrument replacement.  NASA is interested in encouraging private-sector (commercial) industry to develop capabilities for satellite servicing in LEO.  Extending the life of NASA and other government satellites would fill anticipated data gaps due the insufficient funding to continue the existing paradigm of replacing the satellite when they no longer provide the data needed, such as the following: <p> 	Existing gaps in polar weather coverage 	Unexpected failures of instruments 	End-of-life of existing environmental satellites <p> Servicing offers many advantages from an Earth Science perspective: <p> Would be less costly than replacing the current $50B infrastructure with $50B of new satellites Provide needed data continuity <p> PARTICIPATION POLICIES <p> This RFI is seeking respondents interested in independently developing concepts and capabilities to service spacecraft.  Respondents seeking funding from NASA are ineligible.  If NASA decides to go forward with servicing ideas, NASA will issue separate requests for proposals.  Because of U.S commercial objectives and various legal constraints, any prospective Partners are limited to U.S. commercial entities.	However, a Partner may incorporate some international components as long as it is in compliance with U.S. export laws and regulations. <p> INFORMATION REQUESTED <p> RFI responses must include the following information: <p> a.Name of Respondent; <p> b.Respondents address; <p> c.Name and contact information for primary Respondent Point of Contact (POC), including POCs name, title (or affiliation with Respondent entity), email address, and phone number; <p> d.General description of Respondents capabilities and experience in the subject matter of this RFI; <p> e.Specific feedback, comments, and suggestions on information provided in this RFI. <p> f.Responses to the following specific questions, which will be used to determine the credibility for sharing subject information: <p> 1.What role do you see for your company in servicing satellites in LEO?  In particular, provide information that demonstrates your companys viability in satellite servicing by addressing the following: <p> a.Include a copy of your companys announced business plan that includes crewed operations in orbit and/or satellite servicing in LEO <p> b.Discuss your companys investment (or internal R&D) in satellite servicing and related systems <p> c.At high level, describe hardware (such as a vehicle) your company has designed for supporting space activities <p> d.Discuss your companys proven in-space capability <p> 2.Discuss any aspects of the information provided in this RFI that would significantly impact the participation of your company <p> 3.What clarifications or suggestions do you need to minimize impacts to your capabilities or improve design flexibility, safety, or reliability?	Provide rationale for any alternative suggestions that meet the goals stated herein. <p> DISCLAIMER <p> It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose Respondents proprietary information obtained in response to this RFI.  To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a Respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential. <p> In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information being requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government.  It is emphasized that this RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Quotation, or Invitation for Bid.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3 titled Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes, and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement.  <p> The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI.	No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation were released, it would be synopsized in the FedBizOpps or NASA Acquisition Internet Service website at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51">http://prod.nais.nasa .gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51 </A>	. It is the responsibility of any potential offerors/bidders to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation, synopsis, or related documents. As part of its assessment of industry responses, NASA GSFC may contact respondents to this Request for Information if clarifications or further information is needed. <p> RESPONDING TO THIS RFI <p> All final submissions shall be submitted via e-mail to both points of contact listed below no later than  February 28, 2014, 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.	Two hardcopies of the final submission shall be sent to: <p> NASA Goddard Space Flight Center ATTN: Dean Patterson/210.9 8800 Greenbelt Road Greenbelt, MD 20771 <p> Please reference NNG14FA93-RFI in any response. Files may be submitted in MS Word, PDF, or RTF format.	All responses shall be no more than ten (10) pages.  A page is defined as one (1) sheet 8.5 x 11 inches using a minimum of 12-point font size for text. <p> NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS RFI RESPONSE. Respondents are highly encouraged to submit any questions via email regarding this RFI by February 14, 2014, to allow the Government time to develop responses prior to the due date for submissions.  All questions and responses will be posted prior to the response date to the maximum extent practicable to assist all potential respondents.  <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<a href="mailto:jeremy.l.mcmurry@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>Lower Extremities Blast Injury Prevention Standards <br> Request For Information  <br>  <br>  <br> This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Headquartered at Fort Detrick, Maryland.  The USAMRMC mission is to provide medical knowledge and materiel lifecycle management to protect, treat and optimize Warfighter health and performance across the full spectrum of operations. <br>  <br> The Department of Defense (DoD) Blast Injury Research Program Coordinating Office (PCO) coordinates the DoD blast injury research investment, on behalf of the Executive Agent (EA), to ensure critical knowledge gaps are filled, avoid costly and unnecessary duplication of effort, and accelerate the fielding of prevention and treatment strategies by leveraging existing knowledge and fostering collaboration and information sharing among the world's blast injury experts. The PCO advises the EA through Commanding General (CG) USAMRMC, on Military Health System (MHS) Blast Injury Prevention and Treatment Standards to recommend to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs [OASD(HA)]. To identify the best available standards that will meet the needs of the DoD, the PCO in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University-Applied Physics Laboratory developed the MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standards Recommendation (BIPSR) Process.  The BIPSR Process is designed to address the needs of all Services for biomedically valid Blast Injury Prevention Standards to protect against the entire spectrum of blast injuries. The process provides an unbiased, stakeholder-driven critical assessment methodology for identifying the best biomedically valid candidate MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standards currently available. It supports the development and testing of safe weapons, and effective combat platform crew and individual protection systems. It is important to note that the BIPSR Process is not a research program and does not develop new injury criteria or injury prediction tools. However, it does inform research by identifying gaps where no suitable standards currently exist. <br>  <br> The term  quote mark Military Health System (MHS) Blast Injury Prevention Standard quote mark  is defined as a  quote mark biomedically-valid description of physiologically- or biomechanically- based injury and performance responses of a human to blast insults quote mark .  The standards can range from simple dose response curves and injury thresholds that address single components of blast insults, such as peak force, to complex algorithms and computational models that address multiple components of blast insults, such as force-time history.  These standards will play a critical role in the prevention of Warfighter injuries and the enhancement of Warfighter survivability by informing health hazard assessments, survivability assessments, and protection system development aimed at producing safe weapon systems, survivable combat platforms, and effective protection systems.  To conduct these assessments, the DoD needs MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standards to investigate the physiological effects of blast injuries on the Warfighter, both when generated by enemy explosive weapons and from blast exposures during weapon systems firing. <br>  <br> For the purposes of this RFI, Blast Injury is defined as the injury that occurs as the result of the detonation of high explosives, including vehicle-borne and person-borne explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, and improvised explosive devices. The taxonomy of injuries from blast explosive devices is: (a) Primary: Blast overpressure injury resulting in direct tissue damage from the shock wave coupling into the body; (b) Secondary: Injury produced by primary fragments originating from the exploding device (preformed and natural (unformed) casing fragments, and other projectiles deliberately introduced into the device to enhance the fragment threat); and secondary fragments, which are projectiles from the environment (debris, vehicular metal, etc.); (c) Tertiary: Displacement of the body or part of body by the blast overpressure causing acceleration/deceleration to the body or its parts, which may subsequently strike hard objects causing typical blunt injury (translational injury), avulsion (separation) of limbs, stripping of soft tissues, skin speckling with explosive product residue and building structural collapse with crush and blunt injuries, and crush syndrome development; (d) Quaternary: Other  quote mark explosive products quote mark  effects - heat (radiant and convective), and toxic, toxidromes from fuel, metals, etc. - causing burn and inhalation injury; (e) Quinary: Clinical consequences of  quote mark post detonation environmental contaminants quote mark  including bacteria (deliberate and commensal, with or without sepsis), radiation (dirty bombs), tissue reactions to fuel, metals, etc. To manage the scope of assessments the human body is viewed in eight sections: head and neck body region, thorax, abdomen, pelvic and urogenital, spine and back, lower extremity, upper extremity and dermal burns.  The types of injuries to these eight sections are: Polytrauma/Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Extremity Trauma, Hearing Loss, Peripheral Nerve Injuries, Urogenital, Eye Injuries,  Abdominal Injury, Paralysis/Spinal Cord Injury, Burns, and Fractures. <br>  <br> Based on priorities, the BIPSR Process is currently focused on Human Lower Extremities (LE) Blast Injury Prevention Standards. The LE includes: lower limb, femur, knee, tibia, ankle (talus), foot and heel (calcaneus).  The BIPSR Process injury types of interest are Fracture, Vascular Injury, Nerve Injury, Muscular Injury, Ligament and Tendon Injury, Traumatic amputation, and Dermal Burns.  The BIPSR Process has identified the operational environments and intended uses of Human Lower Extremities (LE) Blast Injury Prevention Standards for the protection of military service members that are in mounted (in a vehicle, standing or seated, restrained or unrestrained), dismounted (not in a vehicle, standing or seated), aircraft ejection and hard landing, ship deck slap (rising force underneath vessels and the collapse that follows), underwater load environments, underwater explosions, and underwater shock. The BIPSR Process identified a need to define injury criteria and test methods to establish thresholds for protective systems designed to protect the military service members' lower extremities from all blast injury categories and types in their respective operational environments.   <br>  <br> This RFI seeks to  (1) obtain information on existing Human Lower Extremities (LE) Blast Injury criteria, thresholds, and models, etc that could be considered as potential DoD standards, and those being developed or researched (2) identify gaps (3) allow performers/producers of existing protection systems that are highly relevant to understanding human tolerance limits and predicting injuries sustained by blast injuries to describe how they can assist in standards identification, development and research (4) identify entities that have developed, or are developing or researching blast injury, criteria, thresholds and testing methods, and possess appropriate scientific expertise, experience, and resources to describe and provide the scientific evidence needed to inform the standards (5) identify and obtain methodologies, tools, models and simulations, dose-response curves, injury thresholds., computational models, their components and parameters and associated technologies, an upgradable platform for continuous integration of improved technologies (6) obtain information from a broad community, including industry, academia, and other federal agencies on the availability of military relevant blast injury standards.  <br>  <br> To submit copies of publications, articles, reports, images, etc. related to existing or developing Human Lower Extremities (LE) Blast Injury criteria, thresholds, and models, etc. for consideration as potential DoD Military Health System Blast Injury Protection Standards, please go to the DoD Blast Injury Research Program website at: https://blastinjuryresearch.amedd.army.mil/index.cfm?f=application.rfi.  You will be asked to provide basic contact information and will then be provided a user name, password, and a link to the RFI submission site.  After submitting your document(s), you will receive confirmation that your document was successfully submitted.   <br>  <br>  DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES <br>  <br> This is an RFI issued solely for information and program planning purposes; it does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Submission is voluntary and is not required to propose to a subsequent Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (if any) or other research solicitation (if any) on this topic.   <br>    <br> The USAMRMC/U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA)/DoD Blast Injury Research PCO will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI.

MSPV Request for Information Questions

The questions/comments in this RFI will assist the IPT in the development the future requirements by identifying commercial best practices and the capabilities of potential offerors:
A. Requirements
As stated in the draft Statement of Work, (SOW), Attachment A, the awardee shall be able to take orders electronically, deliver ordered items, and warehouse items until needed. Is your firm able to fill these requirements on its own, or will you need teaming arrangements (including joint venture partners or subcontractors) to fill some aspects of these requirements? If not, which of these requirements would need a teaming arraignment?
If you have a Teaming arrangement does the joint venture partners or subcontractors have past performance history indicating successful and uninterrupted coverage in adverse conditions? 
VA's healthcare networks cover sizeable geographic areas and often involve adverse or severe weather conditions, but delivery of healthcare to Veterans must proceed without interruption.  Will your firm be able to perform in accordance with the draft SOW without interruption? Will you need a teaming arrangement to ensure continuity of coverage?  How will the teaming contractor support to ensure continuity of coverage? 
Explain how you will manage risk and your criteria for measuring success. 
What is your capability to deliver the following federal supply codes: 
6510 (Surgical dressing materials); 6515 (Medical & Surgical instruments, equipment); 6520 (Dental equipment, instruments, supplies); 6525 (X-ray equipment and supplies); 6530 (Hospital equipment, furniture); 6540 (Opticians equipment and supplies); 6545 (Medical sets, kits, and equipment); 6630 (Chemical analysis and equipment); 6640 (Laboratory equipment and supplies); 6650 (Optical Instruments, Test Equipment, Reagents); 6670 (Scales and Balances); 6509 (Drugs and Biologicals, Veterinary Use); 6532 (Hospital and Surgical Clothing and Related Special Purpose Items); 6550 (In Vitro Diagnostic Substances, Reagents, Test Kits and Sets); 8520 (Toilet Soap, Shaving Preparations, and Dentifrices); 4240 (Safety and Rescue Equipment). *

*Medical supplies are those that are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and the maintenance of health (usually through nonsurgical means). They are characterized as one or more of the following: 1) primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose; 2) generally are not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; 3) usually ordered and/or prescribed by a physician and/ or a health care professional. Medical supplies utilized in conjunction with durable medical equipment are included if the supplies are necessary for the function of the equipment. 

Surgical items are those involved with the branch of medicine which generally treats disease or injury by operative intervention (physical means rather than drugs); i.e. operations requiring access to the inside of the body as well as manipulation from outside the body. Surgical procedures include those that involve relieving mechanical malfunction or obstruction of an organ and/or repairing or removing (if irreparable) a diseased or injured organ, which cannot be otherwise healed or salvaged by medical treatment. All supplies related to these types of manual procedures used in the management of injuries and disease, including pre and postoperative care would be covered by this contract. 

Some items that are categorized as durable medical equipment (DME) are permitted under this contract if they assist with the above medical and surgical goals as defined above. DME is considered equipment that can withstand repeated use. This equipment is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose. This equipment is generally not useful to a client in the absence of illness, injury, or disability, and it is appropriate for use in the home or community setting. DME includes, but is not limited to, the following: hospital beds, crutches, canes, wheelchairs, walkers, peripheral circulatory aids, cervical collars, traction equipment, physiotherapy equipment, oxygen equipment, and ostomy supplies as well as knee braces, prostheses, feeding pumps, apnea monitors, and pulse oximeters.

This modification covered up to 15 days (1-15 Jan 2014) of support. Due to the ongoing nature of the services currently being performed under the contract, and the need to continue these services, Excalibur is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services until award of the competitive follow-on contract. Excalibur is in-place and currently providing services without the need for demobilization or mobilization costs that would give cause to incur a break in services; thereby, mitigating impact to over 10K+ military service members ability to wash their military and personal belongings. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement, and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this extension was procured on a sole source basis. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Any questions pertaining to this announcement shall be submitted (in writing) to Mr. Earl Boutelle at earl.h.boutelle2.civ@mail.mil.

<CONTACT>Michael J. Chiodi, Contracting Specialist, Phone 6123363203, Fax 6123363550, Email michael.j.chiodi@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The USDA Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) in Orient Point, NY intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106 (b), to the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI), Wageningen UR located in Lelystad, The Netherlands. The purchase order is for the Hybridoma cell line responsible for the production of the monoclonal antibody V7 against the Classical Swine Fever (CSF) E2 protein. The Hybridoma will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures).
<p>The sole source determination is based on CVI being the sole owner of the rights to the Hybridoma cell line. Although many monoclonal antibodies specific for binding to various regions of the structural E2 protein of Classical Swine Fever Virus exist, none of them tested to date offer the following unique and/or combined features as the V7 monoclonal antibody does. This is likely due to the unique epitope within the E2 protein recognized by the V7 monoclonal, an epitope which has not to date been definitively mapped. The properties seen in experiments using the V7 monoclonal show unique specifications needed by the FADDL Diagnostic Services Section for better CSF surveillance testing results. The anticipated total value of the purchase order is EUR 40,000.00.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide a monoclonal antibody as effective as the one produced by the Hybridoma cell line from CVI. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to michael.j.chiodi@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 3:00 pm central time, February 6, 2014.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought  <br> Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) Support Services <br>  <br> This is a Sources Sought Notice ONLY.  This is not a Solicitation; therefore responses to this request are not offers. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: The Program Executive Office Soldier (PEO Soldier) was established in June 2002, in order to serve as a single acquisition office to support the war fighting needs of U.S. Soldiers. A single strategic plan to thoroughly modernize the Soldier was devised that would serve Army modernization goals.  Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier was created by the Army with one primary purpose: to develop the best equipment and field it as quickly as possible so that our Soldiers remain second to none in missions that span the full spectrum of military operations. Since its creation in 2002, Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier has outfitted U.S. Army Soldiers with the best products available both to protect their lives and to advance their missions. <br>  <br> By viewing the Soldier as part of an integrated system, PEO Soldier ensures that the Soldier and everything he or she wears or carries works together as an integrated system. The result is an overall systematic design that benefits Soldiers by enhancing their ability to accomplish individual and collective tasks, improving quality of life, building confidence, and saving lives. Headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, PEO Soldier designs, develops, procures, fields, and sustains virtually everything the Soldier wears or carries. By employing innovative concepts and technologies, PEO Soldier has made great strides in quickly getting improved equipment into the hands of Soldiers when and where they need it. <br>  <br> SETA SERVICE SCOPE:  <br> PEO Soldier seeks the continuity of critical SETA services to include logistics and fielding services that enables the successful completion of its mission for the Warfighter.

The HQs and PM SSL, SPIE, and SWAR are all located at Ft. Belvoir, VA.  PM SW is located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ.

The support areas include but are not limited to tasks for program management, planning, studies and capabilities development, liaison and operations support; strategic communications, engineering and logistics support,  new equipment training, system test and product fielding support, acquisition and contracting support, software development and support and system safety, studies and analysis and quick response support. The vendor shall provide support for all phases of system life cycle management to PEO Soldier products.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), intends to negotiate a sole-source acquisition with Gartner Inc., for Benchmarking Alternatives Analysis for Disaster Recovery (DR) using GSA procedures (FAR Part 8). The OCC is seeking the proprietary benchmarking data collected and analyzed only by Gartner, Inc. to assist the OCC in determining the options for disaster recovery services. Gartner is the only company that maintains a vast benchmarking database (about 10,000 data points) specifically related to information technology that has been collected from its client engagements from federal and private companies. The benchmark data not only covers all areas of IT, from servers &amp; networks to applications to business processes but it has been tested and validated. The OCC requires that Gartner use its database to compare and assess the OCC's requirements against other regulatory agencies and industries with same or similar infrastructures. This unique benchmarking database not only allows for access to an in-depth comparative analysis to other peers' systems that no other company obtains, but provides data that is readily available. Also, Gartner is expected to use this same database to develop cost models for various options and for compiling a summary analysis of alternatives that would satisfy the OCC's requirements, while considering risk, security and cost in the final analysis. Due to the nature of OCC's requirement, Gartner is the only vendor capable of providing access to their proprietary benchmarking database which can provide benchmark data related to disaster recovery services. <br />Any responses received as a result of this notice, shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. Responses will NOT be considered as either proposals or bids. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based upon any written responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The DOI Business Integration Office (BIO) has confirmed that vendors, which do not already have a vendor record in the NPS financial management system (FMS), that try to submit a quote in FedConnect, are not having their quotes interface to the FMS.  The Buyer/CO will not know that the quote exists and they cannot directly pull it from FedConnect.
The BIO is actively working the issue with CompuSearch and FedConnect. The BIO is also trying to determine if there is a report that can be pulled of failed transmissions.  Currently, there is no workaround other than to have vendors submit quotes through other means than FedConnect.  
Please submit your quotes through email instead of the FedConnect system. If they are too large for email, please contact me BEFORE the deadline and we will pursue a work-around.

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet. Please feel free to use the FBO site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to modify the Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with FLIR Systems, Inc. (N00164-11-D-JN68) to add a requirement for enhancements to the current Clip-on Night Vision Device-Thermal Sight (SU-271/PAS). The sights are considered commercial items but have been improved based on operational and developmental test and evaluation. The Government intends to procure enhanced Sight systems and retrofit existing Sight systems to the enhanced version. Services include the retrofit of existing Sight systems and an update of the operator(s) manual and other contract data requirements.</p>
<p>The current SU-271/PAS sights are uncooled thermal sights that provide the shooter with the capability to add a thermal capability to their existing day optics by attaching the sight in front of the day optic when required. This allows the shooter to use their familiar day optic reticle and adjustments at night and in adverse weather conditions to engage targets to the effective range of their 5.56mm weapon. They can also be used as stand-alone thermal sight or hand held sight with 1/2x, 1x, and 2x magnifications. The sights operate using either AA or CR123 battery types in any orientation. The sights interface with MIL-STD-1913 rails with a quick detach locking throw lever for attachment. The height above rail is 1.535 inches. The sights are waterproof to 66 feet seawater for 2 hours. The sight when mounted to the host weapons shall not interfere with the normal function of the host weapons.</p>
<p>The enhancements are to increase the effective range of the sight system to provide improved capability of target engagement up to and beyond the effective range of the weapon and out to the effective range of their 7.62mm weapons. This is accomplished by changing the objective lens to a longer effective focal length lens, realigning the boresight/collimation, and setting up the software. This will also provide multiple magnification settings of 1x, 2x, and 4x. A modification will be issued to add a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to manufacture enhanced systems and to modify/retrofit existing systems to the enhanced version. The enhanced item must maintain the same training, controls, menu system, and common spare parts to the original SU-271/PAS. All data shall be modified and updated to represent the enhanced configuration.</p>
<p>The SU-271/PAS is a clip-on long wave uncooled thermal imager from ranges out to 300 meters. The enhanced Sight version would replace the objective lens with a longer focal length objective lens to increase the range out to 800 meters.</p>
<p>The potential quantities to retrofit are up to 474 units at an estimated total cost of $950,000 and up to 1500 new systems with a contract expiration date of 30 September 2016.</p>
<p>The Government also intends to incorporate clause 5252.239-9605 Technology Improvements into the above numbered contract to satisfy existing and emergent requirements.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a separate competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of the FAR 6.302-1 with Tetra Tech, Inc. to provide support services to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Science and Technology (OST), Standards and Health Protection Division (SHPD) under contract titled ?Technical Support for Assessing, Managing, and Communicating the Ecological and Human Health Risks of Contaminants in Water, Fish and Sediments and Microbial Pathogens in Surface Waters?, EP-C-09-019, for an additional 6,500 level of effort labor hours to be utilized to extend the contract which expires March 31, 2014, by six months, until September 30, 2014.
SHPD's responsibilities under the Clean Water Act of 1987 (CWA) and EPA's Strategic Plan include directing the national program for adoption of Water Quality Standards, developing prevention and remediation strategies to reduce the risk to human health and aquatic life resulting from contaminated fish and sediment, beach monitoring and advisories relating to microbial pathogens in surface waters, and preparing outreach and awareness materials including developing instructional material and presenting workshops.  Contaminants in surface waters, sediments, and fish tissue pose threats to ecological and human health. Microbial pathogens in surface waters also pose threats to human health through bathing beach exposure. The Fish, Shellfish, Beaches, and Outreach Branch (FSBOB) is developing methods and guidance for EPA program offices, State agencies, local governments, and nongovernmental organizations to assess, remediate, or otherwise manage, and communicate the risks associat ed with exposure to these contaminates and microbial pathogens.   FSBOB is also conducting studies to assess the national extent and severity of sediments and fish tissue contamination, as well as water borne pathogens present at bathing beaches.  The contractor shall provide services to support  risk based analyses; economic and statistical analyses; model development and applications; guidance and report development; compilation and analysis of national and international environmental data; methods development and validation; environmental assessments; field sampling; laboratory analytical services; workshops, conferences, training, and logistical support; expert/peer review support; public outreach and technology transfer; compilation, categorization, and summarization of comments; and preparation of presentation materials.
EPA believes that Tetra Tech, Inc., with its experience in working the current contract, is uniquely qualified for this short term additional effort and Tetra Tech, Inc. is the only responsible source able to perform this 6-month effort due to its combination of expertise, knowledge of the equipment and facilities, and familiarity with ongoing projects required to meet EPA?s critical deadlines.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The anticipated award date for this modification to the existing contract is February 28, 2014.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527.

The Offeror's proposal shall also demonstrate how the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely satisfied the requirements specified in the PWS. <br /><br /><strong><em>Key Subfactor E.3 Technical Approach for Task Order 1</em></strong>- The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate the Offeror's understanding of the requirements of the first task order and describe how the Offeror proposes to successfully complete it, including meeting all milestones. The Offeror shall describe how it will perform and manage individual tasks required by the PWS for Task Order 1 and ensure that Contractor services and deliverables comply with the requirements of the PWS. The PWS for Task Order 1 is attached.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volume II - BUSINESS Volume (Factor F - Price)</span></strong><br />The Proposal Form (Standard Form 33), must be executed fully and used as the cover sheet (or first page) of Volume II. Include one (1) originally signed copies of the form in the Original Volume II. The Offeror shall submit the following as part of Volume II:<br /><br />A. Base Contract Pricing - The Offeror shall submit its price information based on its proposed fixed-price fully burdened hourly labor rates for each proposed labor category.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall propose fixed fully burdened hourly labor rates for each labor category it proposes for each year throughout the projected life of this contract. NIST anticipates the award of an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one (1) base period of twelve (12) months from date of award plus four (4) twelve-month option periods. The Offeror shall assume that the contract will begin on February 3, 2014. Therefore, each proposed labor category shall be assigned a fixed fully burdened hourly labor rate for the base period and each of the four option periods. <br /><br />Under the anticipated IDIQ contract, labor-hour task orders shall be issued. For each future task order under the anticipated contract, the contractor shall propose a total Not-to-Exceed price based on the labor rates in the contract and will be asked to provide a price breakdown to enable the Government to make a price fairness and reasonableness determination. <br /><br />The Offeror shall propose fixed fully burdened hourly labor rates for the following periods. The Offeror shall assume for price proposal preparation purposes that the contract will begin on February 3, 2014. However, these dates are not binding and the actual period of performance of the base contract may be different than listed below:<br /><br />Base Period: February 3, 2014 - February 2, 2015<br />Option Period I: February 3, 2015 - February 2, 2016<br />Option Period II: February 3, 2016 - February 2, 2017<br />Option Period III: February 3, 2017 - February 2, 2018<br />Option Period IV: February 3, 2018 - February 2, 2019<br /><br />The Offeror's fully burdened hourly labor rates must reflect the current market labor rates with any discounts provided. Current significant budgetary constraints demand that the impact of these constraints and ownership of the solution be shared throughout the public sector including its contractors. Offerors are asked to consider reduction or elimination of costs/pricing of the escalation of labor hour rates during the performance period of this contract. If the proposed labor rates will increase throughout the life of the contract, the Offeror shall provide a justification for the escalation of each proposed fixed fully burdened hourly labor rate for each period. For example, if the proposed labor rates increase by 2% each period, a justification for this increase shall be submitted in the Business Volume.<br /><br />A. Task Order 1 Pricing - The Offeror shall also propose pricing for Task Order 1 and describe its proposed labor mix.</p>
<p>The pricing breakdown shall include the number of hours proposed per contract employee and the corresponding fully burdened hourly labor rates from the Base Contract Pricing. The proposed number of hours for each proposed contract employee shall be clearly identified and associated with the applicable labor category for each contract employee. For proposal preparation purposes, the Offeror shall assume a start date of February 2, 2014 for Task Order 1.<br />In order to facilitate the award process, ALL offers shall include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein as follows:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."<br />OR<br />The Offeror shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)"</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an Offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the Offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.<br />The successful Offeror must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the website https://www.sam.gov. Failure or refusal to register in SAM will forfeit award.</p>
<p><strong>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</strong><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.<br /><br />Price Evaluation<br />The Government intends to use a price/technical tradeoff process to award an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Combined Synopsis Solicitation <br /></strong>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />The solicitation number for this requirement is NTSB-R-14-0001. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).<br /><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72.<br /><br />This requirement is issued as a total small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 541211, "Offices of Certified Public Accountants". The small business size standard of this NAICS code is $19M.<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>In 1966, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established by statute as an independent Government agency located within the Department of Transportation for funding and administrative support. NTSB was made a wholly independent agency on January 3, 1975 when Congress approved the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, Public Law 93-633, and began operation as such on April 1, 1975. Later, in 1996, the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 104-264) expanded the role of the NTSB to include coordinating victim and family assistance. In 1997, the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act extended the provisions of the 1996 Act to include foreign carriers operating in the United States. The NTSB is charged by Congress to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States, most public-use aircraft accidents, and significant accidents in other modes of transportation, and to conduct special investigations and studies.<br /><br />In 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-424) gave the Office of Inspector General, Department of Transportation (DOT) responsibility over reviews over NTSB's financial management, property management, and business operations, including internal accounting and administrative control systems, and ensuring adherence with Federal laws, rules and regulations. . The Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOT IG) through a contract with an independent auditing firm audits the NTSB' financial statements each Government fiscal year. The independent auditor's report on the FY 2013 and FY 2012 financial statements identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.

2.	CONTRACT TITLE.

API, N-Acetylecysteine (NAC), USP grade

3.	BACKGROUND.

The VA Cooperative Studies Program (VA CSP) is the Division of VA Research and Development responsible for planning large clinical trials which they conduct at numerous clinical locations for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The CSPCRPCC purchased this NAC manufactured by MOEHS Iberica S.L.(MOEHS) in Spain from Interchem Corporation in 2013 (501-D30001) and 2012 (501-D20026) under Contract # VA 258-12-C-0070 to manufacture 300 mg capsules for use in the CSP # 578 clinical research trial (study) for the "Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography: A Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (PRESERVE)."

Because two lots of the product were lost due to formulation and manufacturing problems, the CSPCRPCC needs additional MOEHS Iberica S.L. (MOEHS) API, NAC, USP grade, to make additional 300 milligram capsules to allow completion of the study by veteran patients.

4.	SCOPE.

Work on the CSP # 578 clinical research study for the "Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography: A Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (PRESERVE)" started approximately two years ago. When the study started, the CSPCRPCC's Clinical Materials Manufacturing Section believed that 100 Kg would be more than adequate to manufacture all the 300 mg tablets required for the study.

A number of problems were encountered when manufacturing the first two lots of product which were not expected when planning the project, resulting in the loss of both lots. Because of the loss of the first two lots, the 100 Kg of NAC originally planned to provide capsules for the entire study is no longer adequate. Thus an additional 50 Kg of the API, NAC, USP grade must be ordered to complete the study.

The CSPCRPCC needs to purchase the API, NAC, USP grade from the same manufacturer that originally provided it. We require the use of the same manufacturer because:

a.	If we change API manufacturers, we must notify the FDA of the change. The FDA must approve the use of a new API manufacturer for the study. The API manufacturer currently used in the study is listed in the Investigational New Drug (IND) regulatory submission to the Food and Drug Administration as the manufacturer of the API.  The FDA requires certain data to be collected and submitted in the IND for the API manufacturer. We do not have time to obtain this data, submit it to the FDA, and wait for FDA to allow continuation of the trial using a new API manufacturer.
b.	If we change API manufacturers we will probably need to alter the product formulation because each API manufacturer has a different method for synthesizing or making their active ingredient. The differences in the manufacturing process include crystal structure, size, shape, flow characteristics, etc. These changes will require reformulation of the 300mg API capsule which is an expensive and time consuming process that was not budgeted.
c.	Reformulation of the 300 mg capsule could potentially result in the loss of additional capsule lots.
d.	The differences between different manufacturer's API resulting in different formulations could also bias the clinical trial (study) results.
e.	This study is also being conducted in Australia. If we change API manufacturers, the Australian regulatory equivalent of the FDA must approve the use of a new API manufacturer for this clinical trial. Thus if we change API manufacturers we would be required to also submit extensive information to the Australian regulatory authorities and wait for their approval to continue the study in Australia.
f.	There is a potential that either the FDA or the Australian regulatory authorities would require the CSPCRPCC to conduct a bioequivalence study to show the API made by the new manufacturer is equivalent to the API made by the previous manufacturer. Bioequivalence studies could easily cost in excess of five hundred thousand dollars which is not available for this study.
g.	The company manufacturing the API, NAC, USP grade must have a Drug Master File (DMF) on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DMF demonstrates to the FDA how the manufacturer meets the regulatory, processing, quality and safety requirements for the manufacturing of the API, NAC, USP grade.
1.	MOEHS, the company that provided the API currently used in the CSP # 578 clinical research study has a DMF on file with the FDA.
2.	When the CSPCRPCC submitted their IND to FDA to obtain authorization to conduct the clinical trial, MOEHS, through their distributor Interchem Corporation gave FDA the right to review their DMF for the CSP # 578 clinical research study.
3.	Three companies from which the CSPCRPCC will purchase product hold DMFs for NAC.
4.	We only have permission from the company that provided the original API to allow the FDA to access their DMF. If we changed to another manufacturer we would need to ask that company to provide the FDA authorization to access their DMF as it relates to our IND. We would need to obtain additional information from the new company including but not limited to stability data on their API. We would need to update our IND to reflect the new company, stability data, test methods, specifications and results and any other applicable information and submit it to FDA. This process takes months to occur delaying and possibly halting the clinical trial in addition to requiring numerous labor hours which were not budgeted for the study.
5.	Our experience is that each API manufacturer has differences in their analytical methods. Assuming there are differences we would need to revalidate our analytical methods and alter our test procedures which would require additional unbudgeted labor hours.

The CSPCRPCC needs to immediately purchase one 50Kg drum of the API to manufacture 300 milligram capsules for use in the CSP # 578 clinical research study. The CSPCRPCC would like to receive the API in-house no later than March 1, 2014 to allow enough time to manufacture, bottle, label, package, and ship the 300 milligram capsules to U.S. and Australian clinic locations participating in the CSP # 578 clinical research study so they can dispense the product to veteran and Australian patients before the current drug either expires or we run out of inventory.

Any delay to obtaining the 50 Kg drum of API, NAC, USP grade will seriously impact the mission of the VA Cooperative Studies Program and the health of the veterans enrolled in this clinical research study by delaying research designed to prevent serious adverse events following angiography. The research study budget which includes providing veteran patients with drug product also supports employee salaries. Stopping the study would stop financial support for many employees.

cc.	STABILITY STUDIES - A study used to determine the length of time it takes a product to degrade to where it no longer meets its specifications. The product is typically stored at three different temperature and humidity conditions to stress the product and mimic different conditions the product might encounter throughout the world.

Typically for API, tablets and capsules, multiple tests are conducted when the product is made.  It is tested again at three and six months for the lowest and highest temperature conditions.  It continues testing at 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 month time points from the date of the initial testing for the expected storage condition.

dd.	USP - The United States Pharmacopeia is the official pharmacopeia of the United States. Pharmacopeia meaning literally, 'drug making,' is a reference work for pharmaceutical drug specifications. USP establishes written (documentary) and physical (reference) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products and ingredients. These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

DOCUMENT CONTROL SYSTEM
STATEMENT OF WORK


1.	SCOPE:
The contractor shall provide a WEB BASED electronic document management and control system for the George E. Wahlen SLC VA HCS Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service.  The document control system should meet or exceed the requirements critical to regulatory compliance of the College of American Pathologists Standards.

09.25.2012 Laboratory General Checklist  pgs. 18-19

**REVISED** 07/11/2011
Phase II Document Control GEN.20375
The laboratory has a document control system.
NOTE: Document control requirements apply to all policies, procedures and forms (including quality management documents) for all processes and activities that are subject to CAP accreditation. The laboratory must have a document management or control system to assure that: 1) all copies of policies and procedures are current; 2) personnel have read the policies/procedures relevant to their job activities; 3) all policies/procedures have been authorized by the laboratory director, before implementation; 4) policies and procedures are reviewed at least biennially by the laboratory director or designee; 5) discontinued policies/procedures are quarantined in a separate file for a minimum of 2 years after the date of discontinuation (5 years for Transfusion Medicine). It is recommended that the laboratory maintain a control log listing all current policies and procedures and the locations of copies (including derivative documents such as card files and summary charts). The control log may contain other information as appropriate, such as dates when policies/procedures were placed in service, schedule of review, identity of reviewer(s), and dates when policies/procedures were discontinued/superseded.

Electronic (computerized) manuals are fully acceptable. There is no requirement for paper copies to be available for the routine operation of the laboratory, so long as the electronic versions are readily available to all personnel. However, procedures must be available to laboratory personnel when the electronic versions are inaccessible (e.g. during laboratory information system or network downtime); thus, the laboratory must maintain either paper copies or electronic copies on CD or other media that can be accessed via designated computers. All procedures, in either electronic or paper form, must be readily available for review by the inspector at the time of the CAP inspection.

Electronic versions of procedures must be subjected to proper document control. Documentation of review of electronic procedures may be accomplished by including statements such as "reviewed by [name of reviewer] on [date of review]" in the electronic record. Alternatively, paper review sheets may be used to document review of electronic procedures. Documentation of review by a secure electronic signature is NOT required.

Additional requirements regarding procedure manuals are found in section-specific checklists, and in this checklist in the Collection Manual, Computer Services and Safety sections.

<p>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION MEDICAL SERVICES CONTRACT<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Special agents are duly sworn federal law enforcement officers who possess accounting expertise and specialized skills to investigate complex financial crimes. Agents must be able to handle long hours and stressful, dangerous, and potentially violent situations. Special agents investigate and assist in prosecuting individuals for tax and other financial crimes, such as money laundering, currency violations, high-level narcotics trafficking, organized crime, and fraud.</p>
<p>Since the duties of these positions are exacting and involve the responsibility for the safety of the others under potentially stressful conditions, all tentative selectees and incumbents must possess physical, emotional and mental stability. Therefore, all applicants and incumbents must pass the medical requirements as outlined in the Treasury Enforcement Agent medical standards published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1800/criminal-investigator-treasury-enforcement-agent-1811/. Incumbents audiogram results will be evaluated against the Occupational Health and Safety Administration Hearing Conservation Standard as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.95 and Recording and Reporting Criteria for Occupational Hearing Loss Cases as outlined in 29 CFR 1904.10 (a).</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The IRS-Criminal Investigation (CI) is seeking a medical contractor to provide medical services to the special agent applicant pool and incumbent population. The Contractor will be required to evaluate applicants and student trainees to determine if they meet the medical qualifications for the special agent position; conduct mandatory incumbent annual medical screening examinations to determine if they can safely participate in law enforcement duties and the physical fitness program (PFP). Annual audiograms will be evaluated to determine if an average of 10 decibel (dB) standard threshold shift exists at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz when compared to the agents' baseline audiogram, as well as all the other requirements outlined in 29 CFR 1910.95.</p>
<p>The Contractor Medical Review Officer (MRO) will also provide medical expertise in evaluating agents conditions that require fitness for duty examinations and/or Independent Medical Evaluations (IME) to determine if the condition under evaluation precludes safe performance of law enforcement duties, including when returning to duty from an injury or illness or when a medical or psychological condition is self-reported that may pose a safety risk. The Contractor will ensure agents and applicants receive the appropriate tests necessary to make medical determinations and report clearance results to the Agency as timely as possible.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the necessary facilities, staff, materials and equipment to administer an all-inclusive medical examination/screening program, and assist IRS with the development of new CI policies and programs and continue to implement current policies and programs. The Contractor will sub-contract to medical specialists on a case-by-case basis, when necessary.</p>
<p>The Contractor will work with the respective CI personnel in updating forms and reports as necessary to reflect updated changes with CI policies within the timeline established.</p>
<p>3.0 RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS</p>

<p>(d) The Contractor shall procure clinics that provide quality care and are knowledgeable and capable of performing the full scope of the CI medical screening services accurately. The clinic personnel are expected to be proficient at performing the services requested and act in a professional manner. The clinics are expected to have a clean and sanitary environment. Special agents, student trainees and applicants must have the capability to make an appointment for their medical screenings. The contractor should avoid using clinics that provide walk-in services only in order to avoid long wait times. Clinics are expected to be located in safe areas.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall have sufficient full-time medical staff to supervise and audit the examining physicians and clinics to adequately establish a system for quality control. The supervisory staff shall include, at a minimum, physicians Board-certified in Internal Medicine and/or Occupational Medicine with the ability to exercise perceptive judgment on health standards.<br />(f) All means of exchanging or transmitting sensitive information from the Contractor to the IRS must meet IRS policies and federal guidelines and requirements. Applicable guidelines and requirements may vary depending on methods and technologies used. There may be some technologies mandated by the IRS for sensitive information, such as SecureZip and encryption. The Contractor shall perform all cryptographic operations using, at a minimum, FIPS-validated (e.g., FIPS 140-2 or later) encryption technology. (NIST SP 800-53 SC-13 CE1).</p>
<p>3.2 Central Administration and Records</p>

The Contractor agrees not to breach the confidential nature of the medical records generated under this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain all original medical examination/screening forms in a secure location meeting all federal requirements for medical records.</p>
<p>3.3 Medical Review Officer and Key Personnel</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that a Board Certified Internist or a Physician Board Certified in Emergency Medicine or Occupational Medicine with knowledge of CI federal law enforcement medical requirements reviews each case. The Contractor shall ensure qualification standards consistency and program compliance through internal standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>All other personnel must have knowledge and experience in occupational medicine and the processes for a medical clearance program.</p>
<p>4.0 OTHER REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>4.1 Examinations/Screening Process</p>
<p>The Contractor will schedule examinations/screening appointments via a password protected secure webpage through which designated personnel will be able to track examinations, screening progression and medical clearance status.</p>
<p>The Contractor will send out incumbent examination packets, incumbent medical exam results, pre-placement medical information and other relevant CI medical information utilizing the established UPS account for the Contractor through the IRS. The Contractor will be provided with an account number and will include relevant information in the reference field as an identifier.

<p>4.3 Pre-Placement Medical Clearance Exam Process and Tracking<br />Applicant and Special Agent Student Interns</p>
<p>The Contractor will be provided with the Applicant Medical Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that provides the details of this process. Medical examinations are required to determine if the special agent applicants (including re-instatement transfers) meet the basic medical qualification standards and can safely perform the physical and medical requirements of the special agent position. Since the duties of these positions are exacting and involve the responsibility for the safety of the others under potentially stressful conditions, all tentative selectees must possess emotional and mental stability.</p>
<p>Participants in the Special Agent Student Intern Program must also pass a pre-placement medical exam prior to the conversion to the special agent position. Special Agent Student Interns are required to complete at least 640 hours of work experience and educational requirements as quickly as possible in order to convert to a special agent. The conversion to a special agent must take place within 120 days after completion of degree requirements. Therefore, it is imperative that the special agent student trainee's medical clearances are given high priority with the medical examination and clearance process.<br /><br />The IRS Cincinnati Employment Branch (CEB) will provide the Contractor with a "hot list" of applicants and student trainees that need pre-placement examinations. The hot list may also include applicants and student interns who need to update their health history questionnaire 18 months from the initial clearance and repeat their medical examination that expire 24 months from the initial clearance. The IRS Cincinnati Employment Branch will notify those individuals who need to be re-evaluated 60 days prior to the expiration of their health history questionnaire or medical clearance.</p>
<p>The Contractor will mail the pre-placement medical information directly to the applicants and student interns and schedule their medical examination appointments within 10 calendar days of receipt of notification. The Contractor will utilize the IRS UPS contract and comply with the IRS policy regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII). All packages to agents or perspective agents containing PII (i.e., social security numbers, etc.) will be double packaged. The Contractor will facilitate the applicant and student intern medical clearance processes and provide IRS designated personnel with a password protected secure webpage so that they will be able to track examination/screening progression, as needed.</p>
<p>When requested, weekly reports will be provided (Friday @ noon Eastern, with the exception of holidays) by the Contractor on the status of each applicant and SAST medical clearance. In the event of a Friday holiday, the report will be provided the day before or after the Friday holiday. The Contractor will provide medical results, clearance status and all required follow-up within 15 work days of completion of the medical exam via a password protected secure webpage.</p>
<p>If additional medical information is required in order to make a medical determination, applicants and student interns will be given 30-calendar days to provide the information to the MRO.</p>
<p>If the medical information submitted within 30 days is incomplete or not the information requested, a medical determination will be made based on the medical information the MRO has on file.</p>

<p>4.5 Annual Medical Screening Examination and Clearance Ratings</p>
<p>It is mandatory for all special agents to complete their annual medical screening clearances for participation in PFP, Hearing Conservation Program and Lead/ZPP screening programs.</p>
<p>The Contractor will mail all incumbent special agents the necessary medical information packet for their annual medical screening examination 60 days prior to their birthday, utilizing the IRS UPS contract and complying with all PII policies. It is imperative that agents schedule their exam upon receipt of their medical packet and take their exam prior to their birthday to allow enough time for the MRO to review their evaluation to avoid a lapse in their medical clearance. All medical clearances expire on the agent's birthday. The Contractor will send out email reminder notifications to agents who have not completed their medical screening within 30 and 45 days after the packet is issued. A copy will be sent to the designated CI personnel on the 45-day notice.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this requirement and exceptions are coordinated with the Contractor and the CI Embedded Human Resources staff. For instance, agents who are stationed overseas are required to take their annual medical screening when they return to the United States annually. All newly hired agents at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) will not be required to take their annual medical screening while in training. All new hires will be placed on the incumbent birthday exam schedule once they report to their respective field office after completion of training.</p>
<p>The MRO reviews the findings from the contracted examining physician and will determine if the agent can safely perform law enforcement duties and participate in the PFP. The MRO will also determine if any conditions reported pose a safety risk in performing law enforcement duties. If a safety risk is identified, the MRO will will work with Employee Relations/Labor Relations (ER/LR) in placing the agent on Temporary Restricted Duty and request additional medical information regarding the conditions identified.</p>
<p>At their own expense, agents may opt to go to their private physician for their annual medical screening examination, however; the blood lead test and audiogram must be conducted by the CI medical contractor. Agents must notify the medical contractor if they choose to go to their own physician for their annual medical screening. The agent is responsible for ensuring that his/her private physician completes and submits the required CI medical screening examination form to the Contractor MRO for review. The CI MRO will review the medical results for all agents and provide a final medical determination if the agent is cleared to participate in the physical fitness program and has met lead surveillance requirements.</p>
<p>The exam turn-around timeline does not go into effect until the Contractor receives all paperwork and lab results from the agent's private physician.</p>
<p>Agents may need to provide additional medical information or go for additional medical tests if the MRO identifies significant health risks, conditions or diseases that require clarification before a medical determination can be made. The agent is responsible for payment of any additional testing needed in order for a medical determination to be made.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide resting EKGs to agents every 5 years beginning at the age of 40. Exercise EKGs (stress tests) will be given if the MRO determines that it is medically necessary. Agents will not be authorized official time to exercise until they have received a medical clearance from the MRO.</p>
<p>The Contractor will notify the designated CI Headquarters personnel of those agents who are non-compliant with completing their medical screening examination; not cleared - no exam and not cleared - no information provided.</p>
<p>IRS will provide the Contractor with the new clearance categories to reflect current CI policies. The Contractor will update the clearance ratings for all active agents. Clearances updates in CAS and related reports will be completed within mutually agreed upon timeframes.</p>
<p>The Contractor will re-review all medical screenings taken since August 27, 2010 and apply/transfer the new clearance ratings. The MRO will re-review those cases that require further evaluation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>4.7 Blood Lead and Zinc Protoporphorin (ZPP)</p>
<p>The blood lead and ZPP test is a mandatory component of the annual medical screening. If the blood lead and ZPP results are found to be above recommended OSHA levels, the MRO will contact the agent to repeat blood lead testing along with a test for a Complete Blood Count (CBC). The MRO will post all lead and ZPP results on the Contractor's password protected online system for designated CI personnel (i.e., Use of Force Coordinator and the CI Industrial Hygienist) to review for further preventive measures to be taken.</p>
<p>4.8 Hearing Conservation Program<br />All Special Agents are included in the CI Hearing Conservation Program (HCP). As part of the HCP, audiograms will be offered to every incumbent agent. The MRO will review each annual audiogram to determine if the agent meets the OPM. http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1800/criminal-investigator-treasury-enforcement-agent-1811/<br />medical qualification standards at and if an average 10 decibel (dB) standard threshold shift exists at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz when compared to the agents' baseline audiogram. The MRO will also determine if all other requirements outlined in the OSHA Hearing Standard, 29 CFR 1910.95 as well as the OSHA Recording and Reporting Criteria for Cases Involving Occupational Hearing Loss, 29 CFR 1904.10 (a) are met. If an agent is found to have a hearing condition, the MRO will recommend a repeat audiogram. If the special agent fails the repeat audiogram, he/she will be placed on TRD and scheduled for a Functional Hearing Test (FHT.</p>
<p><br />4.9 Fitness for-Duty Exam and/or Independent Medical Exam</p>

The Chairperson of the Medical Advisory Committee must approve all requests for FFDE and/or IME. The Contractor will then schedule a medical examination at a location as close to the agent's home or office as possible.</p>
<p>The MRO will review the results of the special agent's current medical documentation from his/her private physician and the FFD/IME medical examination results to determine if, based on the medical condition under review, the agent is able to safely participate in law enforcement duties and the PFP and if further evaluations are necessary (e.g., psychological, medical, etc.). If it is determined that a psychological FFDE and/or IME evaluation is necessary, the Contractor will schedule appointments with either an approved psychologist and/or a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Employee travel costs to these sites are not included in this agreement and should be worked out between the employee and CI. The MRO will discuss the coordination of appointments and other pertinent information with the St. Louis LR/ER office to communicate with the employee. This is done to ensure special agents understand and comply with the details of the ordered exam. After the FFDE and/or IME results are reviewed, the MRO will provide a final report to CI Chairperson of the Medical Advisory Committee through the CI Health and Safety Officer within 30 calendar days of completion of all examinations.</p>
<p>4.10 Temporary Restricted Duty (TRD)</p>
<p>Temporary restricted duty (TRD) is a short-term status that applies to special agents who do not or are suspected to not have the ability to safely perform the full-scope of the special agent position and/or cannot meet the medical qualifications. The determination to place a special agent on TRD should be based upon the safety concerns that the agent may pose to himself, colleagues or public citizens.</p>
<p>Temporary restricted duty (TRD) is appropriate when there is an expectation or prognosis that the agent will make a full recovery in a reasonable amount of time. Generally, an agent can be placed on TRD for up to 180 days, but it may be extended for longer periods when deemed appropriate (i.e., medical treatment and/or recovery or pending resolution of a proposed personnel action).</p>
<p>The Contractor will advise CI whenever the condition reviewed is at a level where it is believed that a sufficient safety risk exists and the agent should be temporarily restricted from performing law enforcement duties. The MRO will also advise the agency if the agent can safely drive a GOV, participate in defensive tactics and retain a weapon.</p>
<p>4.11 Return to Duty (RTD)</p>
<p>Special agents are required to submit a Return to Duty (RTD) Medical Clearance Form completed by their treating physician when returning or wishing to work after an absence of more than 14 days due to a medical condition.

The MRO will review these forms and make a medical determination within 7 work days as to whether the agent can return to performing the full range of special agent duties.</p>
<p>The MRO's medical determination may result in the following:<br />&bull; MRO concurs and the special agent is approved to return to full duty.<br />&bull; MRO determines the agent needs to provide additional information for clarification before a medical determination to be made. The agent cannot return to full duty until the MRO receives the additional information and makes a medical determination. <br />&bull; MRO determines that the agent should be ordered for a fitness-for-duty evaluation.</p>

<p>The criteria, listed in descending order of importance that shall be used to evaluate each vendor's offer will include technical understanding/management capability, relevant experience, past performance, personnel and price with award being made to the Offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>(a) TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:</p>
<p>Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror clearly demonstrated technical experience, technical understanding, and approach to this project as it relates to the requirements of the SOW. The Government will assess whether the Offeror clearly described its capability to provide effective and efficient services necessary to successfully complete the SOW tasks within the specified period of performance. The Government will evaluate the suitability of the Offeror's proposed solution for the tasks and assess the quality of the solution, likelihood of the solution's success, inherent risk, methodology for approaching the solution, an overall understanding of the requirement. Resource information, such as data concerning material, subcontracts, assignment of labor hours to labor categories, etc., will be evaluated for its appropriateness to the overall requirement. The Government will also evaluate the Offeror's management approach and procedures for managing and controlling the performance of the tasks and providing quality control to ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely and satisfactory manner.</p>
<p><br />(b) RELEVANT EXPERIENCE: <br /><br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's recent and relevant experience in performing tasks related to the SOW. The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its experience on similar work, in particular, experience in law enforcement workforce medical surveillance and health management. Documented experience submitted by the Offeror must be recent and relevant to requirements and tasks outlined in the SOW.<br /><br />(c) PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the SOW.

<p>12.0 EVALUATION OF RATINGS</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed pricing categories and<br />prices.</p>
<p>(1) Excellent: reflects a high probability of meeting the requirements of the SOW. An extremely low risk quote which addresses all requirements of the SOW in a detailed manner. Demonstrates exceptional ability to meet IRS needs.</p>
<p>(2) Very Good: reflects a slightly increased risk of poor performance. A very good rating should still reflect extensive, detailed responses to all requirements. Reflects either less than exceptional ability to meet IRS needs, minor lack of understanding of the SOW, and/or minor mistakes or omissions.</p>
<p>(3) Good: reflects an average risk of poor performance. A good rating should reflect detailed responses to all requirements. Reflects a lesser ability to meet IRS needs (when compared with an excellent or very good), minor to moderate lack of understanding of the SOW, and/or minor to moderate mistakes or omissions.</p>
<p>(4) Satisfactory: reflects a more than average risk of poor performance without changes to the contractors approach. A satisfactory rating should reflect responses to all requirements. Reflects an ability to meet the minimum IRS needs, moderate lack of understanding of the SOW, and/or moderate mistakes or omissions.</p>
<p>(5) Unsatisfactory: reflects a high, unacceptable risk of poor performance. An unsatisfactory rating may not reflect responses to all requirements. It may also reflect an inability to meet minimum IRS needs, severe lack of understanding of the SOW, and/or severe mistakes or omissions.</p>

The PWS for the base contract and the PWS for Task Order 1 are attached. If the Offeror's proposal reiterates the PWS without providing sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate how the Offeror proposes to satisfy the requirements of the PWS, the proposal will not be further evaluated, and the Offeror will not be considered for award.<br /><br />The Technical Approach shall include the following components:<br /><br /><strong><em>Key Subfactor E.1 Understanding of Technical Requirements -</em></strong> The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements presented in the solicitation, the challenges it presents and proposed methodology.<br /><br /><em><strong>Key Subfactor E.2 Feasibility and Completeness of Approach</strong></em> - The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate how the Offeror's proposed approach is workable and how the end results are likely to help the Government successfully achieve its goals.

Include one (1) originally signed copies of the form in the Original Volume II. The Offeror shall submit the following as part of Volume II:<br /><br />A. Base Contract Pricing - The Offeror shall submit its price information based on its proposed fixed-price fully burdened hourly labor rates for each proposed labor category.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall propose fixed fully burdened hourly labor rates for each labor category it proposes for each year throughout the projected life of this contract. NIST anticipates the award of an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one (1) base period of twelve (12) months from date of award plus four (4) twelve-month option periods. The Offeror shall assume that the contract will begin on February 3, 2014. Therefore, each proposed labor category shall be assigned a fixed fully burdened hourly labor rate for the base period and each of the four option periods. <br /><br />Under the anticipated IDIQ contract, labor-hour task orders shall be issued. For each future task order under the anticipated contract, the contractor shall propose a total Not-to-Exceed price based on the labor rates in the contract and will be asked to provide a price breakdown to enable the Government to make a price fairness and reasonableness determination. <br /><br />The Offeror shall propose fixed fully burdened hourly labor rates for the following periods. The Offeror shall assume for price proposal preparation purposes that the contract will begin on February 3, 2014. However, these dates are not binding and the actual period of performance of the base contract may be different than listed below:<br /><br />Base Period: February 3, 2014 - February 2, 2015<br />Option Period I: February 3, 2015 - February 2, 2016<br />Option Period II: February 3, 2016 - February 2, 2017<br />Option Period III: February 3, 2017 - February 2, 2018<br />Option Period IV: February 3, 2018 - February 2, 2019<br /><br />The Offeror's fully burdened hourly labor rates must reflect the current market labor rates with any discounts provided. Current significant budgetary constraints demand that the impact of these constraints and ownership of the solution be shared throughout the public sector including its contractors. Offerors are asked to consider reduction or elimination of costs/pricing of the escalation of labor hour rates during the performance period of this contract. If the proposed labor rates will increase throughout the life of the contract, the Offeror shall provide a justification for the escalation of each proposed fixed fully burdened hourly labor rate for each period. For example, if the proposed labor rates increase by 2% each period, a justification for this increase shall be submitted in the Business Volume.<br /><br />A. Task Order 1 Pricing - The Offeror shall also propose pricing for Task Order 1 and describe its proposed labor mix.</p>
<p>The pricing breakdown shall include the number of hours proposed per contract employee and the corresponding fully burdened hourly labor rates from the Base Contract Pricing. The proposed number of hours for each proposed contract employee shall be clearly identified and associated with the applicable labor category for each contract employee. For proposal preparation purposes, the Offeror shall assume a start date of February 2, 2014 for Task Order 1.<br />In order to facilitate the award process, ALL offers shall include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein as follows:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."<br />OR<br />The Offeror shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)"</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an Offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the Offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.<br />The successful Offeror must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the website https://www.sam.gov. Failure or refusal to register in SAM will forfeit award.</p>
<p><strong>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</strong><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.<br /><br />Price Evaluation<br />The Government intends to use a price/technical tradeoff process to award an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of proposals, the Contracting Officer will review them to determine if each Offeror followed all of the proposal preparation/submission instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated using the factors and subfactors described below. An Offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in that proposal's being determined to be unacceptable.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors for Award:</p>
<p>FACTOR A - EXPERIENCE <br />FACTOR B - PAST PERFORMANCE<br />FACTOR C - KEY PERSONNEL/PROGRAM MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATIONS, <br />CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE<br />FACTOR D - PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY CONTROL PLAN <br />APPROACH<br />FACTOR E - TECHNICAL APPROACH <br />FACTOR F - PRICE</p>
<p>In determining best value, Non-Price Factors A through E, when combined, shall be equally important to Factor F (Price).</p>
<p>The Non-Price Factors A through E listed above are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced Offeror or to the Offeror with the highest rating based on non-cost/price Factors A through E listed above if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>

<p>Uncleared firms selected for contract award will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL at the Top Secret level. Secret cleared selected firms will be sponsored for an upgrade to TS. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. A period of six (6) months from the date of sponsorship will be allowed for selected firm(s) to obtain an Interim or Final Top Secret FCL. After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to a selected but uncleared offeror. Contract award cannot be made until the selected firm(s) have been granted a Top Secret FCL.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Top Secret FCLs. Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.</p>
<p><br /><br />Selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 541, et seq.).<br />After short-listing by a Pre-Selection Board, firms may be required to make a presentation to the A/E Council (Selection Board) in Rosslyn, VA.<br />Firms which meet the requirements of this solicitation are invited to submit: two copies of Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications and two copies of a qualification statement, in Block H of the SF-330, addressing the evaluation factors listed below, one of which should contain an original signature.

Offeror quotes must be complete, sufficient and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation. It will be the sole responsibility of the offeror to ensure that its quote is received by the Government at the stated deadline date and time. The offeror's proposed price must be in U.S. Dollars. <br />B. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:<br />Offerors must submit their quotes via email. The contents therein must be properly tabbed, organized and legible. Offerors quotes shall not exceed twenty (20) pages in length. <br />1.

All questions must be submitted in writing to the cognizant Contract Specialist, Ms. Marissa Wright at wright.marissa@dol.gov no later than 29 January 2014 NLT 11:00AM CST. Responses to questions submitted, if/as appropriate, will be responded to via an amendment to the solicitation.<br />4. Below are the submittal requirements that must be included in the offeror's package.<br />FACTOR I: Technical Approach<br />The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. The offeror must provide an overview of unique technologies, applications or software that are incorporated into their products. Offeror must describe how their proposal/products will support high demand cyclic periods of production.</p>
<p>FACTOR II: Past Performance<br />The Offeror shall provide at least two (2) examples of contract and/or projects for which they have provided high speed production and office print device services from within government agencies or commercial entities within the three (3) years. The offeror must describe the nature and scope of the contracts/projects and include dates of performance as well as the dollar value of the contracts/projects. The following information, if applicable, must be provided: Each example of experience shall include: <br />a. Name of client<br />b. Contract Title/Number<br />c. Period of Performance<br />d. Approximate dollar value of the contract<br />e. Brief description of the overall goal of the contract<br />f. Brief summary of the Offeror's success in reaching the stated goal and<br />g. Name and telephone number of the customer, if Government experience, provide the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representative;<br />FACTOR III: PRICE <br />a. The offeror shall provide the following:<br />b. The offeror must provide both a unit price and an extended price for each priced contract line item number (CLIN); <br />c. A price breakdown of the proposed total price of each performance period (Lease Year I, Lease Year II and Lease Year III.)<br />EVALUATION <br />In accordance with FAR 12.6, the Government will award a FFP contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the three (3) evaluation factors: Factor 1: Technical Approach, Factor II: Past Performance and Factor III: Price. Factor 1 is more important than Factor 2. The non-Price factors when combined are significantly more important than Factor 3 Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. The price analysis will be conducted in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. <br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />Proposals will be evaluated using FAR 15.4 evaluation procedures, and rated as either Technically Acceptable or Technically Unacceptable. <br />&bull; Technically Acceptable - Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />&bull; Technically Unacceptable - Proposal clearly does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factors <br />FACTOR I: Technical Approach<br />The government will evaluate the oferrors quote which demonstrates the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to provide an overview of unique technologies, applications or software that are incorporated into their products. The government will also evaluate the offeror's ability to describe how their proposal/product supports high demand cyclic periods of production. <br />FACTOR II: Past Performance<br />The Government will conduct a past performance assessment based on the quality, relevancy and currency of the offeror's past performance as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Relevancy is defined as an effort that the offeror performed as a prime or a subcontractor that has a logical connection with the effort required by this solicitation. Currency is defined as work that was performed for at least twelve (12) months in the three (3) years prior to the due date of this RFP. The source of information regarding past performance, the context of the data and general trends in performance may also be considered. A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily contact all of the sources provided by the offeror, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving good past performance rests with the Offerors. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. <br />FACTOR III: Price <br />The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b). No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate price. <br />III. TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a Technical Assistance grant to CPRI , which will support the preparation of a detailed planning and procurement document for the implementation of a Smart Grid Test Bed project in Bangalore, India. The test bed, which will consist of an integrated Interoperability Laboratory and Smart Grid Technology Demonstration Center, will facilitate the Grantee to research and perform controlled evaluations of integrated Smart Grid technologies including substation automation, load management, smart meters, cyber security network sensing, energy management, renewables integration, and applications for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). If implemented, the Smart Grid Test Bed and related facilities would be used by manufacturers, utilities, services firms and academics for various testing, certification and training activities. This Technical Assistance intends to facilitate the adoption of Smart Grid pilot projects as well as the full-scale deployment of Smart Grid technologies.</p>
<p>The proposed TA has been identified by CPRI as a top priority, since it would help facilitate the research and testing of commercial and pre-deployment technologies and system approaches for a variety of Smart Grid applications.</p>
<p>CPRI (www.cpri.in) is an autonomous society (organization) under the Ministry of Power. It was established by the Government of India in 1960 and was reorganized into an autonomous society in 1978. It serves as the national level electric power research organization and undertakes and sponsors research and development projects in generation, transmission, distribution, and operation of electricity supply systems. CPRI also serves as a testing and certification authority at the national level to ensure availability of quality equipment for use under conditions prevalent in Indian power systems.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, CPRI has taken advantage of the paradigm shift in the power sector outlook and has diversified and expanded its capabilities and ventured into advanced technology areas like protocol testing, automation, real time digital simulation of power systems, diagnostic studies, advanced materials, influence of earthquakes, PMUs, SCADA, smart metering and Smart Grid among others. CPRI has already established a number of laboratories including but not limited to Short Circuit Laboratory, Electric Appliance Testing Facility, High Voltage Laboratory, Energy Meter Testing Laboratory, Calibration Laboratory, Substation Automation System Laboratory, Metering Protocol Laboratory, Insulation Diagnostic Laboratory, Power Capacitors Laboratory, Heat Run Test Laboratory, Vibration Laboratory, Structural material Testing Laboratory, and Real Time Digital Simulator system. Some of these facilities could easily be integrated into the proposed Smart Grid Test Center at CPRI's campus in Bangalore. CPRI also operates a number of facilities in other locations, several mobile laboratories, and has also been providing consulting services to the state-owned utilities, USAID, and international firms active in India's electric power market. CPRI's work in the following key Smart Grid areas places it as the ideal beneficiary for the proposed Smart Grid Test Bed Project:</p>
<p>Metering: CPRI has been working in the area of energy metering since 1990. CPRI set up the Energy Meter Testing Lab in 1994. It created awareness of the need for adopting an open protocol for metering for successful implementation of AMI since 2002 as the electricity meter is an essential building block for Smart Grid. CPRI organized an international workshop on metering protocols in 2004 in India and established the laboratory for metering protocols in 2003 as per IEC 62056. This is the first such laboratory established in Asia. CPRI played a significant role in formulation of the Indian Companion Specification in 2010 for IEC 62056 - the data exchange standard, augmenting the metering protocol laboratory for ICS (Indian Companion Standard) in 2010.</p>
<p>Sub Station Automation: CPRI organized an international workshop on IEC 61850 - the standard for Communication Networks and Systems in Substations (another building block of Smart Grid). CPRI established the conformance test laboratory in 2008 for IEC 61850. This is the second independent and internationally accredited laboratory in the World. The laboratory is well utilized by stakeholders from India and abroad.</p>
<p>Distribution Automation: Since 2005 CPRI has diversified into power system automation. It has been offering consultancy for SCADA and DA projects. Some of the important projects are (i) Leader of the committee to draft specification for Karnataka Power Transmission Company Limited (KPTCL) Integrated extended SCADA for transmission network covering about 1300 substations and 16 control centers. Later, CPRI service was availed by KPTCL for supervision of implementation as per design and standards - a quality control measure; (ii) Consortium partner with KEMA for Bangalore city Distribution Automation funded by JAICO (Japanese International Co-operation); and (iii) Consultant to seven towns of Andhra Pradesh and one town of Puducherry for a SCADA projects under the national R-APDRP scheme.</p>
<p>Smart Grid: The decade long experience in protocols and automation has enabled CPRI to develop capabilities with regard to the evolving Smart Grid. CPRI was awarded the consultancy for Design and Development of a Smart Grid pilot for Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM). The project was supported by USAID. This was the first comprehensive Smart Grid pilot in India. This was followed by another assignment for similar work from Andhra Pradesh Central Power Distribution Company Ltd (AP-CPDCL). CPRI is assigned with lead role at national level for pilot projects to study various facets of Smart Grid. It is also leading the working group on metering - CPRI is identified as a resource institute for training on SCADA and Smart Grid.</p>
<p>Other Areas: CPRI has rich expertise in HVDC, non-conventional energy, HV/UHV domain, power system studies using RTDS, RLA studies, earthquake influence, and material property studies. It also has testing laboratories for cables, capacitors, switchgear, transformers and many other components.</p>

<p>3. The key system requirements for this Sources Sought are as follows:</p>
<p>a. ENVS must be a non-developmental (in-production) goggle that provides binocular, fused vision. The primary viewing capability will utilize image intensifier tubes (NVIS), with the secondary capability provided by a thermal sensor.</p>
<p>Rationale: Guardian Angel rescue forces will use the device extensively for search and rescue missions, as well as threat awareness. A thermal sensor also provides vision during periods of little to no moon illumination and provides other operational improvements over NVIS alone.</p>
<p>b. ENVS must mount to ground helmets using the same mounting systems as current Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).</p>
<p>c. Weight: Total ENVS weight should not exceed 32 oz.</p>
<p>d. Power: <br />i. ENVS shall use a battery that is readily available within Department of Defense supply chains or is readily available from commercial sources. <br />ii. ENVS shall be able to utilize power from a body-worn power system.<br />iii. ENVS shall operate without external power (battery pack only) for at least 6 hours.</p>
<p>4. Interested parties can submit a capabilities package, which should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements and describe how the proposed systems can meet or exceed the above mentioned key requirements. Ensure responses are structured and clearly labeled in the same order as outlined in the above mentioned key requirements. Responses should include a picture and part number of a production system.</p>
<p>5. Utilizing the size status for NAICS code 334220, size standard 750 employees, firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are an other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). Additionally, all prospective contractors must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>6. This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" and associated material procurement and approach risks from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation for the ENVS. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. A key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>7. Respondents capable of responding to only a portion of the total requirement of capability/components stated herein should respond, stating which portions they are capable of and how those portions would be integrated into the total requirement, as applicable.</p>
<p>8. Note that if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization requirements as a percentage of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>9. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>10. When submitting a response, please be aware that the Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed the same Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as organic AF personnel.</p>
<p>11. Responses are limited to 8 pages and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>12. Broad industry participation for this Sources Sought is encouraged. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this ENVS System Sources Sought. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on Fed Biz Ops (FBO), unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company's response. Post submittal one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated.</p>
<p>13. This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available.

These types of trailers are used for lifting and removing engines and are a more complex design than regular transportation trailers. They are mobile, hydraulically self-supporting trailers which are made up of a set of rails connected to an elevating main frame by a hydraulic control linkage system. The Government intends to award a six-year, firm fixed price, Requirements Contract with Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs). The RFP and resultant contract will be structured with one basic contract period of 24 months and four annual option periods and will be 100% small business set-aside. The best estimated quantities (BEQs) are as follows:<br />Basic Period: 15 of each NSN. One of each will be First Articles<br />Option I: 15 of each NSN<br />Option II: 15 of each NSN<br />Option III: 15 of each NSN<br />Option IV: 15 of each NSN<br />First Article units will be required for each NSN. A Product Description (PD) and Statement of Work will be provided as part of the RFP package along with various mandatory data deliverables such as First Article Test Plan and Test Reports. Foreign Companies will not be permitted to participate in the competition.<br />Delivery Requirements will be 535 calendar days after effective date of order for the first article units and 180 calendar days after effective date of order for the first 6 (six) production units with subsequent production unit orders delivering at a rate of 6 units per 30 day period, dependent upon the quantity ordered.<br />FAR Part 15 procedures will be utilized. Offerors shall prepare their proposals in accordance with mandatory, explicit, and detailed instruction contained in the RFP. This acquisition will utilize the tradeoff source selection process wherein a tradeoff between non-cost factors and cost/price is permitted in order for the Government to make a best value award decision. For those offerors whose proposals are found to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past and present performance and cost/price. Past and present performance is considered to be approximately equal to cost/price. The Government will evaluate proposals and make award in accordance with the "Evaluation Basis of Award" provision in the RFP.<br />Interested offerors may notify the POCs listed below for any additional questions. NO TELEPHONE QUESTIONS. Offerors are encouraged to register to receive notification for solicitation and all amendments/revisions and to check FEDBIZOPPS site prior to submission of their proposal. <br />

<p>1.0	Purpose of this RFI<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Contract Operations Division - Falls Church (COD-FC) to conduct market research on the industry's ability to perform continuing development services to enhance the Department of Defense (DoD) Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) Electronic Case File Transfer (eCFT) application.</p>
<p>2.0	Background<br />The IDES is used by the DoD and Veterans Affairs (VA) to evaluate Service members for medical fitness and continued service, and determines appropriate compensation.  The Secretaries of the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs directed implementation of a paperless, searchable electronic case file transfer system with the intent to eliminate paper records and mailing of IDES case files between the departments.  In response, the Departments developed the eCFT that consumes the IDES paper case file (up to 25 MB) and transmits the case file (documents) electronically to the various stages of the IDES process for the Military Departments and VA.  These documents include administrative documents, Service Treatment Records (STRs), Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) reports, Veterans Affairs medical examination reports, and Veterans Affairs proposed ratings and final benefits determinations reports.  Implementation began in September 2012 and was suspended in December 2012 to complete enhancements that will eliminate manual intervention and latency when sending the electronic case files to the VA.</p>

The aircraft will be utilized by BLM for Air Attack operations associated with fire management and for other resource program requirements. The aircraft's reporting base will be Boise, ID; however, BLM may assign the aircraft to other locations, including Alaska. The annual exclusive use period is 90 calendar days. The exclusive use period may be extended depending upon the severity of the fire season and the Government's needs. The Government plans to award a five year contract under which annual orders will be issued for each fire season. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is January 30, 2014, with a projected closing date for offers of February 21, 2014. This solicitation is set-aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code is 481211, Other Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation, which has a small business size standard of 1,500 employees. The solicitation contains minimum aircraft performance requirements; however, the solicitation also includes higher "target" performance capability requirements.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><br />The Office of Research Facilities (ORF), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the availability of small businesses capable of replacing four transformers of 13,800 volt and associated switchgear on the 14th floor of the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) tower in the electrical vault 11, in order to provide reliable and redundant power to the outpatient clinics and research laboratories in the building. <br /><br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238210 (Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors) and the small business size is $14 million. If it is determined that enough qualified small businesses exist to perform the work under this requirement, this acquisition will be set-aside for competition among small business participants.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span> The NIH main campus is located in Bethesda, Maryland. As part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, NIH is the Federal Government's primary biomedical research agency. Following is the description of NIH Bethesda /facilities where Electrical Substation contracts will be performed:</p>
<p>Bldg. 10, ACRF vault 11, NIH Main Campus, Bethesda, Maryland</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:</span> The NIH anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract under a single solicitation. The NIH seeks highly qualified credentialed contractors with capability to perform complex electrical infrastructure work including medium voltage electrical switchgears and substations. The selected contractor shall exhibit demonstrated experience, capability and resources enabling them to plan and construct projects of comparable size and complexity with comparable clients, and most significantly with demonstrated track record of performing such projects with a high degree of customer satisfaction. Selected contractor shall have enough remaining individual and aggregate bonding capacity to perform the contract.</p>
<p>Contractors proposing to perform the contract as joint venture shall use the procedure described at the Small Business Administration (SBA) web site. The SBA URL is www.sba.gov, and the keyword search is Joint Venture and or Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Potential contractors shall have current information in the System for Award Management (SAM). The SAM URL is www.sam.gov. In accordance with FAR 4.1102 prospective contractors shall be registered in the SAM database prior to award of a contract.</p>
<p>The selected contractors shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, materials, equipment, transportation, and management necessary or incidental to constructing the medium voltage electrical switchgears and substations, concrete structure buildings, green roof construction, and must exhibit demonstrated experience, capability and resources in projects of comparable size and complexity, with comparable clients, and most significantly, with a demonstrated track record of performing such projects with a high degree of customer satisfaction. The selected contractor shall be capable of controlling dust and flying debris, and protecting all adjacent areas as the work area will be performed near occupied space is most instances, and shall follow all NIH Fire and Safety Regulation and Procedures. All offerors submitting a proposal to the solicitation must be fully qualified and licensed and have qualified subcontractors as applicable. Failure to meet these qualifications may result in a determination of technical unacceptability. Utility shutdown once scheduled shall be strictly adhered to as continuity of utilities is imperative.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK - CONSTRUCTION SERVICES:</strong></span></p>
<p>The project's purpose is to provide new medium voltage dry-type network transformers and associated switchgear configured in a three source spot network arrangement. The switchgear architecture shall be enhanced by the inclusion of an emergency source via dedicated bus section, segregated by an emergency tie breaker. The dry-type network transformers shall reside on a new structural steel mezzanine <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to be constructed within the confines of vault 11 and over energized 13.5KV transformers and their associated feeders.</strong></span> New medium voltage feeders shall be provided from vault 10, located across the equipment penthouse, to serve the new network transformer array. A carefully orchestrated / phased transition shall be required for two distinct equipment block movements; the transition from liquid to dry-type transformers making way for the new switchgear, and the subsequent transition from the existing switchgear to the new.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of special note: the vertical transport of all equipment associated with this project, both in and out of the facility, is restricted to passenger elevator no.26. Operation of this elevator shall require coordination with building's facilities management, the Office of Hospital Physical Environment (OHPE), and the Project Officer.</span></strong></p>
<p>The ACRF tower is located in the Building 10 Complex on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bethesda Maryland Campus. One of the Vault 11 network transformers has failed. The failed transformer is a Westinghouse 2000 KVA, 13,800 / 480/277V, 3&Oslash;, 4W, 7.0% Z, liquid filled, weighing 14,500 lbs. when filled with cooling medium and 11,125 lbs. when dry. This transformer has been out of service and unavailable to perform its intended purpose for some time. Although lightly loaded, the existing electrical distribution system has been compromised from a reliability standpoint due to the loss of its engineered N+1 arrangement. While various rigging / replacement options have been reviewed and presented for consideration, the NIH has opted to pursue the replacement of the entire transformer array (including primary feeders) as well as a total switchgear replacement. Existing loads are to be re-fed by intercepting feeders within the vault. Complete feeder replacements (switchgear to load) are not a part of this program. This building enhancement is to be performed without extended system outages, and without exotic rigging activities outside the vault itself.</p>
<p>Vault 11 is within the ACRF portion of the NIH Building 10 complex, and located on the north side of the original 1950's vintage building #10 and on the south side of the more recent Clinical Research Center Building (CRC). The positioning of these structures leaves the ACRF 14th floor (Vault No.11, and roof access door) inaccessible for use by an exterior crane. The removal and delivery of all equipment and materials shall be through the use of existing passenger / maintenance elevator No. 26. Air lifting equipment (via helicopter) has been reviewed and determined to be an unacceptable risk, and has thus not been considered in this project. The existing transformers must be drained and cut into pieces small enough and light enough (4000 lbs. max) to descend on elevator No. 26. The new dry type transformers and switchgear must be dissembled to fit on elevator 26, reassembled and tested inside vault 11.</p>
<p>The estimated price range for this requirement is between $4 million and $8 million. <br /><br />The estimated project length is 780 calendar days from notice to proceed (NTP).<br /><br />The selected Contractor shall perform the work so as not to interfere with NIH day-to-day operations and shall coordinate any and all outage requirement with government.</p>
<p>The selected contractors shall be responsible for, but not limited to the following services:</p>

This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this Construction Contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension and an SSC to provide necessary utilities to the training ships. The existing systems and the existing ships must connect via hoses to the new systems, which need to have compatible fittings in order to make the distribution system function as designed.</p>
<p>Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $1,954.05. The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM Description Quantity<br />Hansen <br />DI Quick Disconnect Fittings HK Series, 1" 3 ea<br />CPW Quick Disconnect Fittings HK Series, 1" 3 ea<br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings ST Series, 1" 8 ea. <br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings ST Series, 2" 4 ea. <br />OPW <br />OWS Dry Disconnect Fittings Epsilon, 3" 3 ea.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The existing DI and CPW hose quick disconnect fittings at the facility are Hansen Quick Disconnect HK series. These components are used for connecting the DI and CPW site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses. The existing OWS dry disconnect couplings at this facility are Epsilon Dry Disconnect Couplings manufactured by OPW Engineering Systems. These components are used for connecting the OWS site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses. The existing ALP hose quick disconnect fittings are Hansen Quick Disconnect ST series connectors. These components are used in the maintenance activities for the training ships.<br />All site hoses used for a specific system must be identical for hose compatibility, procurement, maintenance, and testing reasons. In addition, Norfolk Naval Shipyard performs all maintenance on the ships and the fittings for the site must match the equipment and hoses from the shipyard in order to maintain compatibility with the maintenance equipment used for the ships. Using alternate products would require replacing disconnects on site hoses and valve stations at locations beyond the scope of this project as well as replacing expensive maintenance equipment or purchasing additional equipment to allow critical ship maintenance activities to be performed. This would result in a significant amount of rework and duplicate costs to the Government. Furthermore, an extensive modification to the existing systems would create unnecessary downtime and costs for this these mission critical systems.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>

If multiple master keys are required in the building, it could result in delayed reactions during life safety events or security actions which would result in unacceptable outcomes.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only a specific manufacturer (Stanley) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices. The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.<br /><br />8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action. The total proprietary items will be competitively procured. No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL. The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes construction of a new electrical distribution system including new substations and distribution feeders that connect into the existing base-wide distribution system and provide service to the new and existing ships and facilities. Exception to full and open competition is requested under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project. This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this construction contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension with two new and one replacement electrical substation as well as a new express feeder route from the Base electrical distribution system along Redbank Road to the site to provide redundant electrical supply to the site in support of the site. The system ties into the base-wide distribution system and must have protection from backfeeding when testing the generators on the site and the power plants on the ships. In order to accomplish this, protection relays are being installed. These protection relays are manufactured by SEL that are considered proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $7,000. The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM Description Quantity<br />Main breaker protection relay SEL-351S 2 ea.<br />Pier breaker protection relay SEL-751A 2 ea.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />JB Charleston presently uses SEL relays in the substations and feeders on the Naval Weapons Station. For dependability and security for the electrical distribution system on the Naval Weapons Station, it is imperative that multiple computerized or "smart" relays use the same communication protocol and software to ensure the highest level of dependability for continuation of electric power and protection from cyber attacks. Cyber security is enhanced when all relays use the same software as software updates are easier to implement across one platform and password protocols are more likely to be understood and used. Furthermore, electrical maintenance personnel have been trained on how to use and maintain this make of relay. The procurement of any other make of relay would put an undue burden on JB Charleston maintenance personnel in terms of time and cost to be trained on another make of relay.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices. The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15. <br /><br />8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action. The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.

<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The NPTU site is a military installation located within an active Department of Defense (DOD) explosive safety arc. It supports military training operations for the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program and other DOD operations. The site will remain operational and occupied by DOD military and civilian personnel during the construction period. It is imperative that the utmost military site security control be maintained at all times, especially during the construction period when there will be access by outside personnel and construction crews. The existing security system at the site is currently based on a proprietary LENEL system that is equipped with Intrepid sensors, PELCO closed circuit television stations, and Endura interface systems. To avoid any actual security gaps or potential security breaches, the integration of new security components into the existing system must be carefully scheduled and monitored by site security personnel to provide for a seamless transition and integration into the existing electronic surveillance system. The installation of any new IDS and ESS components must also be scheduled for installation and testing by trained security personnel. The site security personnel are trained to detect and respond to known technical issues with the existing systems, and are versed in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) installation procedures to minimize downtime and avoid system crashes. Experience with prior system maintenance has demonstrated that integration of other brand name system components requires additional downtime, which in this instance may result in untenable security compromises inconsistent with the required DOD security requirements for the nuclear site. Other brand names will not meet the agency requirements in this particular instance. The limited proprietary specifications are required to ensure continuity of military operations, enhance the protection of life safety, and maintain the required national security posture of the NPTU nuclear program platform.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY</strong>. <br />This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources. <br /><br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under NAICS Code(s) 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and the Small Business Standard is $14 Million, PSC Code R406 Professional Program Management/Support, for Administrative Receivership Services for Gary Housing Authority, and is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government&rsquo;s requirements. Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered for any subsequent procurement based on the Government's market research, provided that the joint agreements conform to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations in Subcontracting. <br /><br />HUD seeks a Contractor who shall provide services to assist the Recovery Administrator with the day-to-day operations of Gary Housing Authority, located in the state of Indiana, a severely troubled PHA currently in federal receivership, including monitoring and maintaining all systems, policies, procedures, personnel, and programs and ensuring compliance with HUD programs rules and all applicable Federal, State, and Local government requirements. The Contractor shall operate the capital, operating, and voucher programs of the agency, and all associated programs and activities, effectively and efficiently and in compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, program requirements and contractual obligations. The contractor must have experience with severely troubled Public Housing Authorities (PHA) and be able to demonstrate outcomes achieved toward recovery during their PHA work. Please review the performance work statement (PWS) and provide your feedback to Christopher Stuart at Christopher.S.Stuart@hud.gov. Please call 303-672-5278 if there are questions. <br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND <br /><br /></strong>The Gary Housing Authority (GHA), a public agency created through Indiana state law, manages 2,129 units, 1,875 under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) in eleven developments, geographically divided into nine asset management projects (AMPs). The GHA, through Section 8 funding, administers 1,648 Housing Choice Vouchers and 53 Moderate Rehabilitation units. A large-sized public housing agency with approximately 97 employees (60 FTE and 37 PT Security Officers), There are two mixed-finance developments managed by McCormack Baron. The GHA&rsquo;s Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program is currently managed by CVR Associates Incorporated. The HCV program is currently a high performer under SEMAP. <br /><br />The GHA has been troubled since August 20, 2003. On June 22, 2011, GHA was designated troubled by HUD&rsquo;s Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) based on a failing Public Housing Assessment System audited financial score of 0 (of 30), physical score of 18 (of 30), management score of 25 (of 30), Capital Fund score of 9(of 10), and an overall score of 52 (of 100) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. Scores issued on February 15, 2013 for fiscal ending March 31, 2012 notified the agency that its scores decreased, only receiving 33 out of 100 points (physical score of 21(of 40), financial score of 0(of 25), management score of 8(of 25), capital score of 5(of 10) and a late penalty point (-1). <br /><br />On April 2, 2012, due to the agency&rsquo;s troubled status, GHA, the City and HUD entered into a Recovery Agreement accompanied by an Action Plan. Prior to that, GHA had entered into seven different Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) for lack of compliance. In each MOA, the agency failed to implement any of the recovery recommendations as listed in the plans. Additionally, GHA is involved in three repayment agreements, based on the Office of the Inspector General&rsquo;s (OIG) audit of HA&rsquo;s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program.<br /><br />Over the last several years, several leadership teams composed of HUD staff and contractors have been put in place to recover the agency, but numerous problems persist. While efforts are underway to implement asset management and to modernize the housing developments, GHA still lacks a clear, well-defined mission, a well-formulated business and operation plan, and adequate financial management systems. These issues must be confronted and will be factored into a plan and time-line for recovery. As a result of failing to meet the goals outlined in the April 2012 Recovery Agreement and Action Plan, the Mayor of the City of Gary worked with HUD Officials and executed a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement (CEA). The CEA allowed for the transfer of HA&rsquo;s assets, projects and programs to HUD. <br /><br />As of August 2012 a Recovery Administrator has been appointed to fulfill the duties of the Board of GHA and HUD also appointed an Executive Director to run the day-to-day operations.<br /><br /><strong>&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</strong> <br />Contractor: A supplier or vendor awarded a contract to provide specific supplies or service to the Government.

<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 511199 (All Other Publishers), proposed Federal Supply Code (FSC) is 7690 (Miscellaneous Printed Matter), and Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. Estimated ceiling amount is $554 million.</p>
<p>The USPTO is currently developing the Patents End-to-End (PE2E) system involving new replacement tools to be used in the patent examination process. PE2E will enable a new way of processing patent applications, providing a single place to manage examination activities, and supporting the work done now outside or across existing systems.</p>
<p>The overall vision for PE2E weaves together activities that are currently done in separate systems. These systems include work management, application document viewing, searching, Office Actions, and saving reference information and electronic notes for easy retrieval. Integral to PE2E are the Patent Data Capture (PDC) products produced in the performance of the PDC contract.</p>
<p>Detailed requirements for the final integration of PE2E, including patent data capture products, are not finalized and further programmatic changes are anticipated by January 1, 2018. The final integration plan for PE2E notwithstanding, PDC is a continuing vital agency need which requires substantial upfront capital outlays for any contractor providing PDC products with exacting quality standards. Therefore, the purpose of this RFI is to determine the availability and capability of vendors that can provide such continued PDC requirements for a "bridge" period.</p>
<p>Due to the short timeframe for transitioning such a requirement to another contractor who would not have the adequate timeframe to recoup anticipated upfront capital costs, interested parties are advised that the period of performance of any potential requirement that is awarded could be equal to or less than three (3) years after any award is made.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to consider any capital start-up or infrastructure costs when reviewing this RFI and submitting a capability statement that demonstrates resources, ability, and experience to produce patent data products.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that at this time, a bridge contract is the best solution to maintain PDC requirements. The Government may choose to do a bridge contract for one (1) base year, with up to two (2) option years for a potential period of performance of January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. Only the minimum of base year of January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 would be guaranteed on any contract, if award is contemplated by the Government. Contractors are advised that the two (2) option years are at the Government's discretion based on factors such as continued need for patent data capture products and services, any other programmatic changes, acceleration of PE2E implementation, Contractor performance, and available funds for that fiscal year.</p>
<p>The USPTO is seeking information from a contractor(s) capable of furnishing Patent Data Capture products. PDC products enable the USPTO to meet its statutory requirement of publishing patent applications and granting issued patents weekly in standardized formats.</p>
<p>The requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; conversion and quality review of incoming and outgoing documents <br />&bull; high quality conversion of electronic patent application data into standardized formats for publication and issuance<br />&bull; after-allowance document processing <br />&bull; review of patent applications to ensure compliance with applicable statutes and rules<br />&bull; data capture services to support the issuance of Certificates of Corrections (C of C), including printing of the C of C and preparing them for mailing</p>
<p>This RFI is not a request for proposals/quotes and the USPTO is not committed to awarding a contract pursuant to this announcement.</p>
<p>Contractors are hereby notified that as a result of USPTO's exemption from the Competition in Contracting Act, the subject requirement may be procured using the Alternative Competition Method in accordance with the Patent and Trademark Office Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) and the Patent and Trademark Office Efficiency Act, 35 U.S.C. 2(b)(4)(A). If the PTAG Alternative Competition Method is used, the solicitation may only be issued to those determined to be capable of providing the required services or products. This determination will be made based on USPTO's market research, including the responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>The information from this RFI is for planning purposes only and will assist the USPTO in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the USPTO will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL OF CAPABILITY STATEMENT:</p>
<p>Please submit capability statement electronically in your own format to include Name of Organization, DUNS Number, Address, Point of Contact (POC), POC E-mail Address, and POC Phone Number. Please ensure responses do not exceed 20 pages and are submitted in a single document, preferably Portable Document Format (.pdf).</p>
<p>Responses shall be in sufficient detail to allow the USPTO to assess the capability/interest of your organization to meet requirements for Patent Data Capture, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Relevant and recent experience in the past three (3) years<br />&bull; Whether or not organization would team as Prime Contractor or Subcontractor if such a solicitation were issued<br />&bull; Organizational and corporate resources available to meet PDC requirements<br />&bull; Which type of business, if applicable, your organization is, as registered and validated at the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov</p>

<p>If your organization can only fulfill a portion of the requirements outlined above, please identify the requirements you can fulfill.</p>
<p><br />The due date for submission of this information is 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on February 28, 2014.
