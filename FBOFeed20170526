<SOLNBR>DRAFT-TDRAW-HT9402-17-R-0001
<RESPDATE>062117
<CONTACT>Margaret Zancanella, Contracting Officer, Phone  3036763451, Email margaret.a.zancanella.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is a joint, integrated DoD Combat Support Agency that enables the US Army, US Navy, and US Air Force medical services to provide a medically ready force and ready medical force to Combatant Commands in both peacetime and wartime. The DHA supports the delivery of integrated, affordable, and high quality health services to Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries and is responsible for driving greater integration of clinical and business processes across the MHS by: <br />&bull; Implementing shared services with common measurement of outcomes;<br />&bull; Enabling rapid adoption of proven practices, helping reduce unwanted variation, and improving the coordination of care across time and treatment venues;<br />&bull; Exercising management responsibility for joint shared services and the TRICARE Health Plan; and<br />&bull; Acting as the market manager for the National Capital Region (NCR) enhanced Multi-Service Market, which includes Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (FBCH).
<p>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is contemplating a new indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) dental services contract with fixed unit prices for the TRICARE Dental Readiness and Wellness (TDRAW). DHA anticipates the TDRAW will consolidate the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP), the dental requirements of the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP), the dental requirements of the Reserve Health Readiness Program (RHRP) contracts with the Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP). DHA anticipates the TDRAW contract will provide worldwide dental coverage to Active Duty Service Members and their family members, members of the Selected Reserve, Individual Ready Reserve and their family members.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to provide potential offerors with the DRAFT TDRAW Request for Proposal (RFP). This Notice follows two earlier Requests for Information (RFIs) postings (HT9402-DHA-RFI-1 and HT9402-DHA-TDRAW-RFI-2) and is part of ongoing market research. It is intended solely for information and planning purposes only and is NOT a solicitation. Offerors are invited to review the attached DRAFT solicitation documents and submit questions or comments about the DRAFT RFP via email to Ms. Margaret Zancanella, Contracting Officer, Margaret.a.zancanella.civ@mail.mil not later than 4:00 pm MT, June 21, 2017. Please include the following in the subject line: DRAFT TDRAW HT9402-17-R-0001.</p>
<p>DHA is seeking industry feedback and recommendations on DHA's description of the TDRAW requirements and DHA's approach in the draft RFP sections attached to this draft solicitation. DHA will consider industry's comments to revise its approach for the TDRAW program to ensure the Government has realistic requirements and incorporates industry best practices, new technologies, innovative alternatives and potential capabilities as they relate to the TDRAW specifications and performance work statement.</p>
<p>DHA may also incorporate industry expertise, best practices and incentives to ensure the delivery of high quality dental support services to TRICARE beneficiaries within the statutory and regulatory limitations governing this entitlement program.</p>
<p><br />Finally, DHA is considering increasing the age limit to receive sealants from 18 to 23 years of age. Please provide feedback on the following questions:<br />a. What is the maximum age for receiving sealants in your other business plans? <br />b. Do you foresee significant increase in family member premiums for the increased age limit? <br />c. Do you think the increased costs would be offset by improved dental health in the future?</p>
<p>DHA requests that responders identify the specific solicitation document and cite specific paragraphs where appropriate, using the "TDRAW Draft RFP Questions" file included as an attachment to this DRAFT solicitation. DHA requests responders submit any questions or comments about the DRAFT RFP via email to Ms. Zancanella by 4:00 p.m. MT on June 21, 2017. Please state "DRAFT TDRAW HT9402-17-R-0001" in the email subject line.</p>
<p>DHA is not issuing a solicitation at this time, and this Notice shall not be construed as DHA's commitment to issue a solicitation nor does it restrict DHA to a particular acquisition approach. Interested firms shall not send proposals in response to this Notice, nor shall they contact any other individuals about this Notice or the TDRAW requirement. Any information provided to DHA is strictly voluntary and given with no expectation of compensation, and is clearly provided at no cost to the Government.</p>
<p>If DHA issues a solicitation, DHA will conduct any source selection in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15, as supplemented, at Contract Operations-Aurora (CO-A), in Aurora, Colorado. DHA estimates it may issue a formal solicitation later this year on the Federal Business Opportunities (fbo.gov) website.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR THE 
FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA)
 OFFICE OF SECURITY AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY (ASH) 

TELECONFERENING BRIDGE SYSTEM PROCUREMENT

This is a market survey capability assessment for an ASH Teleconferencing Bridge System.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

Purpose:

This market survey announcement is issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy section 3.2.1.2.1 Market Analysis.  The purpose of this market survey is to understand existing vendor capabilities in the market and gain an understanding of the current state of teleconferencing technologies meeting the requirements below.  The market survey is open to all sources including large businesses and small businesses capable of providing a teleconferencing bridge system.

This market survey is issued solely for market research information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  The information submitted in response to this survey may be used to help the FAA further define its requirements and acquisition strategy. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the FAA to form a binding contract.  The FAA does not intend to make an award on the basis of this survey.  Companies responding to this survey are advised their response does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The FAA will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.  Responses to this survey that indicate that the information therein is proprietary, or represents confidential business information, will be received and held in confidence.  Proprietary information submitted, as part of responses to the survey, should be clearly identified and it will be treated as such. 

The FAA reserves the right to follow up on a one-on-one basis with survey respondents to gain additional information or clarity about information submitted.

Overview:

The FAA Washington Operations Center Complex (WOCC) is responsible for monitoring and reporting the events that occur within the National Airspace System (NAS).  The WOCC serves as a central collection point for all pertinent information impacting FAAs mission, the NAS, and national security and then disseminates this information to a myriad of customers both internal and external to the agency.  One of the communication capabilities used on a daily basis is a digital teleconferencing bridge system.  The current system does not meet mission requirements for stability, functionality, and clarity.  The bridge routinely hosts teleconferences with over two hundred simultaneous participants on a single call and multiple other teleconference calls happening in parallel.  During a crisis the number of participants on a single call can increase significantly.  Additionally, special interest teleconference calls are live 24x7x365 and are being recorded throughout the duration of the call(s).  

In Summary, the required Teleconferencing Bridge System must be able to maintain the 24-hour / 365-day teleconference, as well as deliver a dynamic and robust conferencing capability that facilitates the rapid flow of information between executive decision makers and operational offices within the FAA, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Government, the Military and Civilian sector. 

General Requirements of the procured Teleconferencing Bridge System:

It is requested that potential vendors only respond if the minimum requirements outlined below can be met and/or exceeded:

	Two (2), Redundant, Analog Conference Bridges; one (1) at a primary locations and one (1) at an alternate back-up location.
	The Conference Bridge shall have a 600 port capacity on each Bridge, with the ability to tie each bridge together for a total 1200 ports.
	The ability to support a 24 hour, 7 day a week, 365 day a year, 300 plus participant conference call, that is never terminated.  
	The ability to maintain a 99.9% reliability up-time rate
	The ability to support a minimum of 20 simultaneous preset conferences
	The ability to build conferences on the fly
	The ability for an operator to monitor and manage individual conference calls
	The ability to record non-stop 24 x 7 x 365 and play back recordings on demand
	The ability to record all conferences to individual files in configurable time increments ranging from 1 minute to 30 minutes.
	The ability to download recordings via a Graphical User Interface and save recordings in a .wav file format
	The ability to support interoperability with up to fifty analog and digital speaker ports directly connected to the bridge
	The ability to drag and drop to add participants to the bridge or preset conferences
	The ability to identify, isolate, and filter external noise being introduced to the bridge. 
	The ability to mute any and all participants where noise introduction is an issue 
	The ability to drop or disconnect participants from any conference
	The ability to isolate and conduct a private session with any participant of any conference
	The ability to support interoperability with Microsoft Active Directory in order to search for and add participants to a conference.
	The ability for operators to manipulate multiple phone lines/functions through a single user GUI running on Microsoft Windows Operating System.
	The ability to support transmission control via push to talk, hand switch and foot pedal
	The ability for operators to split participants from a conference (privacy mode)
	The ability for operators to announce participants prior to entrance of a participant to a conference
	The ability to display all participants in the conference including operators, speakers, and recorders
	The ability to sort all participants through different column values
	The ability for operators to make a call from the bridge without beginning a conference and then add caller into a conference

<p>ED 316-1 ACCESSIBILITY OF SOFTWARE</p>
<p>The Department of Education (ED) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. <br />Under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d,as amended), ED must ensure the accessibility of its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers of computer applications. <br />To comply with the provisions of this clause, the contractor may use the edition of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of the manual may be found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html <br />(a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, all software delivered to or developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the requirements of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended). <br />(b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract to software for use by ED's employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how the software was first developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor is only required to ensure that enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features or components) of the software fully comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or components that do not meet accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software complies. <br />(c) Waiver of requirements--It is recognized that new technologies may provide solutions that are not envisioned in or consistent with the provisions of the manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." Also, compliance with certain requirements of the manual may not be feasible for the particular software required. In such extraordinary circumstances, the contracting officer may grant a waiver, in writing, to any requirement of the manual or of this clause if it furthers a public interest of ED and will not significantly impair ED's ability to ensure accessibility of its programs and activities to all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. To request a waiver, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, listing the specific accessibility requirements that would not be met and explaining how the accessibility of a particular feature can be achieved by alternative means or why it is not feasible to make a feature of the software accessible. <br />(d) Condition of payment--The contractor agrees that compliance with the provisions of this clause upon delivery of the software to ED is a condition of payment under this contract.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed purchase contract, on a sole source basis, with Attocube System AG for a Nanopositioner. The statutory authority of this sole source acquisition is FAR subpart 13.106-1(b).</p>
<p>The Sample Environment group helps researchers in any phase of the experiment with sample environment issues: planning an experiment, loading a sample, preparing equipment for use, mounting at the spectrometer, and trouble-shooting if any problems are encountered. Any equipment used to alter a sample's environment falls under its care, from a milli-Kelvin dilution refrigeration system to a 1600&deg; Celsius furnace. At the same time, researchers are implementing new methods and equipment to extend experimental variability of NIST's Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) facility.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Nanopositioner is to extend the ability of cryostats at NCNR, by better positioning samples inside the cryostat vacuum can. Currently, when using the cryostats, samples must be manually positioned within the cryostat unit. This acquisition is for a device fitting inside the cryostat unit that shall provide automatic positioning of samples. Which shall allow for a much faster sampling time and allows researchers perform experiments currently unavailable.</p>
<p>The equipment required by this acquisition shall be able to perform at very low temperatures (40 mK) and dimensions 100mm x 50mm x 20 mm to fit within the current cryostat sample can. In addition, it shall be made with non-magnetic material and operated in the high vacuum conditions, which means no lubrication shall be used. This requirement is also inclusive of a controller to operate the positioner.</p>
<p>For acceptance, the positioner shall demonstrate smooth work at cryogenic temperatures. The positioner shall be connected to the controller to check how properly it communicates, operates and responds to the controller commands. Testing will consist of situating the positioner to the vacuum space, cooling it down to the 40 mK, and operating it at these conditions using the controller.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB destination and take place six (6) weeks from receipt of order unless mutually agreed upon the Government's ability to receive earlier. This requirement is expected to be awarded in June, 2016.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 750 employees.<br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern on June 5, 2017. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to erica.miller@nist.gov No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR A/E SERVICES
FACILITY MASTER PLAN

KEY DEFINITIONS

Integrated is the combination of Services Planning and Facility Planning into one continuous and dynamic planning process. Integrated Planning develops strategies consistent with organizational mission and goals, which drive non-capital and capital planning.  This starting point for the integrated planning methodology is current and projected demand for services. 

VA Integrated Planning Team (Team) consists of executives, staff, clinical and technical personnel and other designated persons, including VHA, CFM, VISN and local support teams and their consultants, who will participate in some or all aspects of this services planning effort.  

Facility Planning is the identification of the model for delivery of healthcare services at the facility level. It considers existing facilities and locations, their current and projected operational and maintenance costs, and proposed new, expanded, relocated, or downsized facilities along with their operational and maintenance costs.  Facility Planning includes determination of short and long-term of goals and strategies for all VA-owned and leased facilities. For  off campus  VA owned or leased facilities, only tabulation and identification of the location, size, and purpose is required. 

Service Planning is the identification of specific customer needs by quantity, type, and location over a specific time period and the determination of methods for delivery of those services.  It includes creation of delivery scenarios which consider a variety of potential developments, assumptions, and limiting factors. Methods for delivery include facility-based, non-facility based, non-capital, or other alternatives.  Services Planning takes into account existing capacities, locations, efficiencies, and resources including those of private, local, state, and other Federal organizations. Services Planning is the bridge between VHA-specific strategic planning and actual delivery solutions. Services Planning includes consulting by professional health systems planners, and technical and administrative experts to provide various types of support described herein. 

Medical Services include, but are not limited to Inpatient Services, Outpatient Services, Long-Term Care, Ambulatory Services and Procedures, Medical Diagnostics, Outpatient Mental Health, Home Based Patient Care (HBPC), Dental, Pharmacy, Surgery, Intensive Care, Sterile Processing, warehousing, logistics, nutrition and food preparation and durable medical equipment (DME) and Prosthetics provided by VHA. 

Market Area(s) constitute the basic planning unit in the VA Integrated Planning process.  Each Medical Center or other geographic identifier used by VA includes one or more market areas sometimes also referred to as a catchment area.  

Catchment Area See Market Area.

Delivery Models refers to the various ways that services are or can be delivered.  This process is intended to clearly define the existing delivery models and establish innovative models to provide services that are patient centered, data-driven, continuously improving and team-based. 

Non-capital Solutions include, but are not limited to: telehealth/telemedicine, home care, extended hours, sharing, contracts, and telework.  VA delivers health care in a dynamic environment that increasingly requires agility.  In this environment VA must consider non-capital solutions before capital solutions.  VA will always have a physical presence in key geographic areas, but is moving toward health care that promotes wellness (fewer visits) versus treating diseases.

Market Level Services Delivery Plan is a description of how the optimum service delivery system for each market can be attained and the end state description of the services delivery system in the market. It answers - the questions of  where, what, and by what venue  and  how  the result can be achieved.

BACKGROUND

Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center (Medical Center) in one of 10 VA Hospitals that belong to Veterans Integrated Service Network 4 (VISN 4) that covers Pennsylvania, Delaware and one county in New York.  The main Medical Center facility is comprised of 20 buildings situated on a 50-acre campus.  In addition, the Medical Center operates five VA staffed Outreach Clinics and two privately operated Contract Clinics.  The facilities provide health care services to Veterans living in a catchment area comprised of 18 counties in northeastern Pennsylvania and one county in southern New York (Exhibit A Catchment Map).  

The buildings at the Wilkes-Barre Medical Center Campus consist of (See Exhibit B Building Inventory):

A 68-bed Level 2 hospital (Building 1, circa 1950) which includes a newer clinical addition (circa 2000);
A 105-bed Community Living Center (Building 27, circa 1980); and, 
Multiple attached and detached support structures serving primarily administrative, maintenance and utility support missions (circa 1950 to 1970).  

The Medical Center has invested substantially over the last 6-years to upgrade several areas of the facility.  There remain, however, many other areas/buildings that are aged and require major upgrades to increase their life expectancy, upgrade infrastructure to more modern/energy efficient systems and to create modern, functional and aesthetically pleasing spaces in which health care can be delivered effectively and efficiently.   

The Consultant will assure that all recommendations, future strategic plans and capital asset uses will be designed to assure optimal productivity, performance and integration in order to promote world-class healthcare delivery to the entire Veteran population within the catchment area and, in the case of certain specialty care areas, as a center of excellence that supports the Network and VA as a whole.

Recommendations shall include schematic designs for the main campus and all of the Outpatient Clinics (existing and any new clinics projected during data review).  A general description of existing programs, services and uses by building and floor is included in Exhibit C Existing Uses.

<DESC>Notice of intent

The USGS, Sacramento Office of Acquisition and Grants intends to award a firm-fixed contract to Montana Emergent Technologies (MET) located in Butte, MT,  on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source, for the delivery of several Subsurface Environment Samplers (SES).  MET is uniquely qualified to produce the SES because they built the first prototype SES. MET is the only company aware of the current design requirements and capable of producing the current SES. The USGS has a great need for an SES for many subsurface studies, but has an immediate application need at the USGS Birney field site where these newly developed SES will provide the ability to monitor the microbial conversion of coal to methane and inoculate upflow bioreactors. Due to their experience modifying the prototype SES to improve function within the USGS field site's wells, MET is uniquely qualified to continue modifications to the SES that would allow battery operation instead of cable operation.  

The applicable NAICS code is 334516; PSC is 6655. The anticipated award date is mid June 2016. 

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. No solicitation package will be issued. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses received by 10 am PDT 1 Jun 2017 will be considered by the Government. All information submitted should support the offeror's capability to provide the items/services required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation indicating an offeror's capability to provide these services/supplies. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. Questions shall be submitted electronically to Joseph Riccomini at jriccomini@usgs.gov.

<a href="mailto:Tanya.Sims-Williams@va.gov">Tanya.Sims-Williams@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to issue a solicitation to limited sources for the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Lifecycle Publication Suite - Online Subscription. The solicitation limitation is due to the number of U.S. based companies who are authorized by the manufacture to sell the product. The two known sources are Worldwide Book Services, Inc. and Pink Elephant, Inc. The VA requires 50 concurrent subscriptions to the ITIL Lifecycle Publication Suite - Online Subscription for Multiple Users, which is owned by AXELOS. The circumstance surrounding the chosen product is because the VA has widely adopted ITIL and has instituted a training program to educate the VA workforce. Additionally, this requirement will provide the VA with online access instead of purchasing multiple publications. There are no alternatives. 

This is not a Request for Quote. This is a written notice to inform the public of the Government's intent to solicit limited sources for the required product.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. A determination not to limitedly compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Only written responses will be considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this notice, the Government shall determine whether a solicitation will be issued. Any prospective contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award. Information concerning SAM registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://sam.gov.

Any interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed above to  Tanya.Sims-Williams@va.gov and  micah.kauzlarich@va.gov via email, no later than Friday, June 2, 2017 4:30 PM ET. Fax inquiries will not be accepted. Please provide capability documentation that should at minimum, include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective vendor(s) capabilities and experience that will show the ability to support this requirement.

The inventory in Attachment J-1 includes approximately 10,000 pieces of equipment.  The capacity for Major Repairs (considered minor construction) under the IDIQ CLIN will be in the not-to-exceed (NTE) amount of $2 million per year.</p>
<p>The contract will replace services currently being performed by EMCOR Government Services, Inc., a large business, under contract HQ0034-11-D-0033, which is an Indefinite Quantity-type Contract with Firm-Fixed Price CLINs with a total estimated dollar value approaching $17 million for 5.5 years.

Additionally, large business concerns will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their proposal.</p>
<p>16.  Place of Contract Performance:  The Pentagon</p>
<p>17.  Type of Acquisition:  Based on the results of market research, including the Sources Sought Notice posted on FBO, this requirement will be procured Full and Open Competition utilizing FAR Part 15.  This is considered a non-commercial requirement; therefore, the Government does not intend to utilize FAR Part 12.</p>

SATURN offers improved anti-jam capabilities over secure voice to remain interoperable with other AF, DoD, NATO, and coalition aircraft. Integrated Waveform (IW) replaces currently used DAMA SATCOM for BLOS secure voice capability. Both SATURN and IW will be implemented using the already existing Rockwell Collins ARC-210 Gen 5 radio installed on the aircraft prior to this mod. This mod also will include updating the BIP from IFF Mode 4 to Mode 5 capabilities. Lastly, this modification will require design and implementation of an EFB hard mount with power solution to be included as part of the development activity.<br />It is anticipated that EMD will last 2 - 3 years and will result in a design and kit for production that utilizes commercial off-the-shelf/non-developmental items to the maximum extent possible. Operational requirements dictate that EMD activities support transition to production by the end of FY21. Note that the Government does not currently possess unlimited, government purpose, or specially negotiated data rights to any of the software or hardware design data that may be required to facilitate the integration effort with the existing computer processing systems. Rights to all pertinent existing design data currently reside with the C-5M original equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>RESPONSE</p>
<p>Responses shall address the following capability questions:<br />1. Identification of candidate replacement equipment and data sheets<br />2. Technical concept of integration approach<br />3. Overall schedule for EMD<br />4. Hardware/Software Test Requirements<br />5. Ability to accomplish the necessary DO-178B compliant software development for C-5M</p>
<p>Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Sources Sought notice. These responses will enable the Government to identify interested vendors and ensure required capabilities are available in the marketplace. It is advised that all respondents provide sufficiently detailed answers to the capability questions to allow the Government to determine if your company has the ability to provide the requisite effort to support the current modification schedule.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) DFARS 210.001, market research results will be used to determine whether the criteria in FAR Part 19 are met for setting aside the acquisition for small business.</p>
<p>If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply. Please provide rationale as to how compliance with these limitations would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. <br /><br />Please be advised that the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size under the Limitations of Subcontracting, as does the Non-Manufacturer Rule if a supply NAICS is chosen. Respondents should consider how the primary tasks identified in this RFI will be broken out between prime and sub-contractors to avoid ostensible subcontracting, and address in their response if necessary.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 19.201, it is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, including the opportunity to participate as subcontractors. Please recommend a reasonable expectation for small business subcontracting as a percent of total contract value, as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>If your company is capable of meeting some, but not all of the requirements stated in this RFI, please provide a response detailing the requirements you are capable of meeting. This will allow an assessment of whether or not breaking out a portion of the requirement for Small Business is possible and practicable. Any issues regarding Limitations on Subcontracting (including issues of affiliation and ostensibility) should be considered in your response.</p>
<p>If market research leads to a decision to competitively award this requirement, IAW DFARS 215.304, the extent of participation of small businesses shall be addressed in source selection. The contracting officer will evaluate the extent to which offerors identify and commit to small business performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.</p>

Purpose/Description 

1. The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the production engineering support, data/repair data, expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements for the production/repair of Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) A31U18240-3. The ESTS Modernization was required due 
to obsolescence issues with the USAF/RSAF ESTS. The Moderation effort has engineered the
Proprietary data/Intellectual Proprieties (NGC) out which has resulted in a COTS supported environment. Ref figure after paragraph 4.

The requirement is for Engineering /technical services to include securing SOR for GFE/Ancillary Our acquisition strategy is a five-year with a six month extension to services. Contract (basic plus four option years) with a six month extension to services and will continue through FY23. Previous to the Modernization Northrop Grumman has been the only sole source for ESTS engineering support.

2. Originally fielded in 1996, the USAF F-15 ESTS became increasingly difficult to maintain and would have become unsustainable without SES addressing a variety of obsolescence issues for multiple ESTS components. To give some perspective to this challenge, 17 legacy instruments of the total system have become obsolete, and SES developed suitable replacements for all 17. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) requirement to upgrade the F-15 ESTS to an A31U18240-3 configuration, because we are the USAF ESTS A31U18240-3 Kit and Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) contractor developer.  From resolving challenges with parts obsolescence and accuracy of spares data to availability and compatibility to legacy instruments and Test Programs Sets (TPSs. A comprehensive solution was realized via USAF TCTO and comprehensive solution to their obsolescence. This TCTO resulted in the replacement of replace or refurbish outdated instruments for which has virtually eliminated station instrument obsolescence, resulting in a viable competitive and sustainable F-15 ESTS system.   
3. The instruments that comprise the A31U18240-3 Kit, and developed the TCTO Leveraging our working knowledge and lessons learned, obtained from over six years of performing the F-15 ESTS Modernization program, resulting already has a proven approach in place to modify, diagnose, and upgrade the RSAF ESTS to an A31U18240-3 configuration. Services will be required by the contractor. The Contractor Engineering and Technical Support (CETS) required to sustain the ESTS at the RSAF Intermediate Level Centralized Maintenance Facility (CMF) and the required expertise to train the trainers. 

4. All RSAF provided For Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) ancillary equipment is required to be maintained in serviceable condition throughout the specified period.  During the course of this support, the contractor will be required to provide training to RSAF personnel in order to maintain technical proficiency of the ESTS.

                - Install top cap on valve body.  Hand tighten.
                - Valve assembly is now ready to be leak tested.

Testing: On completion of the valve tear down, the valve assembly requires two tests  Leak Test and Pre-Dome Test (Pre-Dome Test is required only if burst disc had been changed).

The tests must be conducted using a nitrogen source, a test bottom cap, close down adapter, and an outlet filling adapter.  See Figure 3 test Station Component Layout.
     1.	The valve assembly is assembled to the test bottom cap.  The outlet adaptor is assembled to the valve outlet.  Attach the nitrogen line and make certain the vent valve on the outlet adaptor is closed.
     2.	Burst Disc Pre-Dome Procedure 0 Open the nitrogen regulator to 580 psi (40 bar) and slowly allow pressure to the valve through the bottom test cap.  This is to pre-dome the burst disc.  Hold this 
        pressure for 1 minute to ensure that there is no drop in pressure indicted by the rest gauge on the nitrogen test set-up.
     3.	Pour water/soap solution into the top cap Schrader valve and apply leak detection spray to all ports on the valve.  If no leaks are detected, the pressure to the valve must be reduced to 363 psi (25 
        bar) and the close down adaptor must be attached.  To close the valve piston, increase the nitrogen pressure to the close down adaptor to 580 psi (40 bar).
     4.	Check for leaks.
     5.	Slowly release the gas pressure from the nitrogen test set-up, vent the close down adaptor, and make certain that the outlet filling adaptor is opened before removing the adaptors.
     6.	If a leak had been detected, it must be rectified and retested.  If the leak persists, the valve assembly must be rejected.

Recharge Instructions:  
     1.
          a. See Figure 4 for a typical recharge station configuration.
          b. Install a drier (such as Hammond DRIERITE filter) in a threaded port on the Novec 1230 agent container.  A drier is required because humid air may cause the agent to convert to an acid.
          c. The outlet of the container requires an inline (20 micron or smaller) filter.
          d. The agent can either be pumped or gravity fed to the tank.
          e. Tank must be visually inspected and clean inside.  IMPORTANT  No Moisture is allowed in the tank.  It must be completed dried.  Water mixed with agent will cause acid.
          f. Rebuild valve.  See Valve Rebuild Instructions, Step 4 and 4a.
          g. Reinstall valve and siphon tube assembly into tank.  Tighten securely.
          h. Purge tank by pressurizing through a Outlet Fill Adapter Assembly (see chart on Page 9-2) to 100 psi (6.9 bar) with dry nitrogen, then vent pressure.  This process will remove humid air from the 
             tank.
          i. Fill tank with correct amount of agent by weight.  See nameplate for this information.
          j. Set regulator to 20 psi (1.4 bar) lower than the required tank pressure based on ambient temperature.  Refer to pressure vs. temperature chart in this section.  Pressurize tank.  Agitate tank while 
             pressurizing.
          k. After correct pressure is reached, close valve near tank valve outlet.
          l. Close tank valve by using Top Adaptor Assembly, Part No. 570579, as follows.  Set regulator to 450 psi (31.0 bar).  Pressure Top Adaptor Assembly.  Open and close the valve rapidly to prevent over-
             pressurizing of tank.
          m. Vent pressure from tank valve outlet.
          n. Remove Fill Adaptor Assembly and install recoil cap on valve outlet.
          o. Agitate tank by rolling or inverting so that the agent can absorb the nitrogen.
          p. Add more nitrogen through the Top Adaptor Assembly.  Using the pressure vs. temperature chart at ambient temperature, set the regulated pressure at the corresponding pressure plus 8 psi (0.6 bar). 
             It takes 8 psi (0.6 bar) to overcome the spring force in the valve core.  Note:  Do not use gauge on valve to determine recharge pressure.
          q. Repeat Steps o and q until the agent has fully absorbed the nitrogen.
          r. Let tank assembly sit for 3 hours.
          s. Check the tank valve for leaks by using soap and water solution.
          t. Check tank gauge pressure based on pressure vs. temperature chart.
          u. Repeat Step "o".
          v. Recheck gauge pressure.  If gauge reading decreased, repeat Step "p."
          w. Once tank pressure is correct, remove from fill station.   

     2. Replace recharged tanks in bracket and follow installation procedures to put system back in service.
     3. Inform proper personnel that the system is back in service.

The contractor is responsible for the management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the Purchase Order (PO).  The contractor shall establish and maintain a Quality Control Plan (QCP) to ensure that all requirements of the PO are met.

Extra Work and Deficient Conditions: The contractor shall notify Reclamation as soon as possible when it is apparent that extra work is required like rewinding armatures, field coils, etc.  If deficient conditions are found, the contractor shall notify Tonya A. Pittsley.  Deficient means out of limit conditions for inspections or tests that are specified herein or found in accepted national or industry standards.  Deficient also means conditions that would not permit the exciter to be returned in an "as-new" condition.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational, market research and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, the FBI will not accept unsolicited proposals. A capabilities statement package is requested. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested and respondents shall refrain from providing such information in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submssions become Government property and will not be returned. If any is issued, it is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.<br /><br />The FBI seeks sources for services provided under NAICS code: 611420 Computer training.<br /><br />The Cyber Career Path Program (CCPP) was created in response to a greater need within the FBI for Cyber Investigators with accredited training. The CCPP will support the ever growing need to combat cyber based threats. The curriculum is specifically aimed at Cyber investigators which consist of FBI cyber agents, task force peronnel and other FBI employees.<br /><br />All interested vendors shall meet the following requirements:<br /><br />American National Standards (ANSI) accredited certification. ANSI provides the International ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation program for personnel certification agencies. The process used by ANSI to accredit certification bodies is based on an international standard (ISO/IED 17011).&nbsp; Adherence to a rigorous internationally recognized accreditation process ensures that the ANSI process conforms to the highest accreditation standard and represents the best practices in certification. An ANSI accredited certification is required to ensure Cyber Investigators are trained in the most up to date, highest caliber methods and practices to combat cyber threats.<br /><br />The technological skills required to investigate cyber matters are constantly evolving. To ensure that investigators remain current, the FBI continuously seeks new and updated training resources for its agents. Supplementing the Cyber Training and Certification program with commercial of the shelf (COTS) courses has proven to be effective because investigators are offered the opportunity to expand their technical expertise beyond the core classes taught in house by instructors who bring their work from the field into the classroom. Examples of these COTS courses include but not limited to : Forensics, Malware Analysis, Incident Response, Penetration Testing, Intrusion Detection, Cloud Security, Virtualization as well as ICS/SCCADA.<br /><br />All interested vendors shall meet or exceed the standards of the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)&nbsp; The capabilities statement shall document them as authorized resellers of GIAC or the offered certification which meets or exceeds the GIAC certification exams. Additionally, the FBI requires courses that are ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 certified or have the potential for that certification. The FBI requires at a minimum 30 specialized information security certifications that correlate to specific job duties.<br /><br />Interested vendors shall also offer multiple delivery methods and a variety of delivery options, including large events, small and local community classes, web-based synchronous and asynchronous instruction with courses updated routinely to keep up with technology. Interested parties shall offer a real time exam management engine that allows the FBI to see the results of a student"s certification, including deadline, pass/fail rates, who is registered and approval of students.<br /><br />The vendor shall offer courses at locations throughout the CONUS. By offering this training at sites across the country, Cyber investigators will have greater access and flexibility to attend the courses necessary to achieve the certification goals as required by the Cyber Career Path program.<br /><br />The vendor shall offer training designed to support counterterrorism, counterintelligence and criminal investigators whose cases involve a cyber-nexus. A multitude of training courses allows the FBI to establish training tracks based on investigtor skills and the needs of a particular division.<br /><br />Interested vendors must offer instructors with a TS/SCI with Poly clearance who are currently teaching. This clearance must be currently active. All courses shall be taught&nbsp;by the vendor's own certified faculty.<br /><br />The courses requested shall be commercially-available-off-the-shelf (COTS) in accordance with Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).&nbsp; The vendor shall not proffer courses which are "developmental" or in any way not commercially available at the time of this RFI.&nbsp; As a COTS item, the courses are made available to the general public.<br /><br />Capabilities statement packages may be e-mailed directly to the attention of Deborah Chin, Contracting Officer at <a href="mailto:Deborah.chin@ic.fbi.gov">Deborah.chin@ic.fbi.gov</a> with "CCPP Capabilies Statement" in the subject line.&nbsp;&nbsp;The capabilities statement&nbsp;shall not exceed 10 pages.&nbsp; All interested parties shall hold an ACTIVE SAM.Gov account.<br />

<DESC>This is a small business sources sought notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this sources sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a request for quote (RFQ). There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 with a size standard $15.0M. Based on the responses received from this sources sought announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a total small business set-aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this sources sought announcement must have the capabilities to provide the services as stated below.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) is an option to treat mitral valve failure when no surgical options exist. In as many as half of patients, TMVR can cause life-threatening obstruction of the left ventricle outflow tract by displacing the native mitral valve leaflet towards the septum. Investigators at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Emory University, and Henry Ford Hospital developed a novel procedure to prevent this life-threatening obstruction. The procedure, known as Intentional Laceration of the Anterior Mitral leaflet to Prevent left ventricular Outflow Obstruction (aka. LAMPOON), herein referred to as the Procedure is a new catheter technique to split the anterior mitral leaflet and prevent iatrogenic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction immediately before TMVR. It utilizes a Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) device marketed for implantation in the aortic or pulmonic positions off-label. The THV device has been approved for investigational use in human subjects by the FDA-reference IDE License G160239. Already, the Procedure has been used successfully in a small number of patients. The NHLBI's Division of Intramural Research (DIR) recently launched a careful FDA-regulated investigation of the Procedure in patients through a national clinical trial. Patients enrolled in the clinical trial are carefully monitored by physicians through a variety of medical exams including CT scans and echocardiograms (aka. Echo). The clinical trial requires a single certified cardiologist to analyze results from each CT/Echo test.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>To assure consistent results and to comply with clinical protocol requirements, the DIR requires a certified cardiologist with specialized experience in CT/Echo and TMVR to perform research-quality analysis of all CT/Echo results obtained for up to 30 patients enrolled in the DIR's clinical trial.<br />Tasks to be Performed</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform CT analysis for up to 30 patients at the following end-points:<br />o	Baseline<br />o	Post-procedure within 30 days<br />&bull;	Perform analysis on echocardiography, both surface and/or transesophageal, for up to 30 patients at the following end-points:<br />o	Baseline<br />o	Intra-procedure<br />o	Pre-discharge<br />o	30 days post-procedure<br />o	Six months post-procedure<br />o	12 months post-procedure<br />&bull;	Receive from participating research sites, store locally, and transmit to sponsor, in compliance with all applicable regulations, the CT and echocardiography imaging data above</p>

<p><br />Purpose and Objectives for the Acquisition: <br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Section on Development and Affective Neuroscience (SDAN) conducts considerable research on anxiety in youth and adults. This research involves identifying different correlates of anxiety as they manifest in anxious individuals, and treatment development. Tracking eye movements is one of the primary neuroscience methodologies employed by SDAN to identify aberrant attentional processes as they relate to anxiety. Furthermore, recent research suggests that eye tracking methods may be used in a treatment setting to train attention patterns away from threat cues, leading to a substantial reduction in anxiety symptoms. As such, eye tracking is becoming a chief priority in SDAN research. To ascertain that this focus is addressed adequately, we must make sure that the equipment we use is of the highest caliber, and is particularly applicable to youth and psychiatric populations. To address this need, we wish to procure eye tracking equipment</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:<br />It is anticipated that delivery of the equipment will be within thirty (30) days of receipt of the order.</p>

The Government physically does not have in its possession, sufficient, accurate or legible data to repair this part from other than the current source. Only the source previously approved by the Government for this item has been solicited. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such than an award can not be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal the information detailed in https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx NAVSUP source approval request at www.navsup.navy.mil. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which was forwarded with your request for source approval. If evaluation of a source approval request submitted can not be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the availability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Department of State Innovation Platform (Design Thinking, Big Think, Hackathons, UX, and more!)
<SOLNBR>SAQMMA-17-RFI-SGP
<RESPDATE>061217
<CONTACT>Terence G. Lord, Email lordtg@state.gov
<DESC><p>This is only a Request for Information. The Government is collecting this information to determine a path forward for a potential procurement. There is no procurement strategy identified. We request that industry provide capabilities, comments, questions, responses to our questions, and any other information deemed relevant or valuable. <strong>We ask that you keep your responses as clear and concise as possible.  Please do your best to limit responses to 10-15 pages, however, we welcome any and all relevant information and feedback in response to this RFI.<br />&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of this Request</span></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State (Department) is interested in building upon our expertise and experience in using innovative tools for our diplomacy and development initiatives.  The Department's bureaus, offices and our overseas posts are looking for ideas from the private sector on how we can incorporate innovation into our diplomacy initiatives, specifically moving to a partnership and collaboration approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, the Secretary's Office of Global Partnerships (S/GP) is proposing an innovation platform and toolkit that offers a variety of services that support innovation tools, techniques and practices. Our vision is to modernize the way the Department engages in diplomacy by institutionalizing private sector collaboration across bureaus and missions within the Department through a web-based one-stop resource center that captures our range of services and technical assistance, as well as provides offices guidance on how to integrate and implement innovative tools and practices (e.g. challenges, competitions, crowd sourcing, etc.) within their missions. This effort was started in response to sequestration, tightening federal budgets and uncertainty about future commitments with the belief that:</p>
<p>(a) Offices need to collaborate with private sector partners that share similar visions and engage in innovative practices that promote our diplomacy initiatives which, in turn, enables the Department to continue to carry out our mission critical functions in challenging budgetary times.</p>
<p>(b) There must be a shift in the old paradigm of "government think" of relying solely on government assets, resources, and abilities to solve complex challenges to more of a "group think" paradigm where collaborative relationships and innovation drive new solutions to these challenges.</p>
<p>(c) Innovation will encourage cost savings and business ideation throughout the Department. Specifically, the platform and toolkit is intended to aid embassies and regional bureaus with limited budgets in identifying and securing innovative services (for purchase and no cost), and guiding them through the process of creating and operationalizing innovative practices such as prizes and challenges.<br /> <br />Bottom line, Department offices still need to carry out their global priorities and initiatives during lean budgetary times to promote our diplomacy mission. What we would like assistance in trying to answer is how can S/GP introduce them to and guide them through utilizing, leveraging and implementing innovative methods and practices to aid them in continuing their vital, mission critical work?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope or Mission<br />&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To solidify a strategy and comprehensive set of innovative tools and methods that will prepare Department offices to advance diplomacy through interactive partnerships.  The Request for Information (RFI) provides an opportunity for interested parties to supply S/GP with information on industry capabilities and perspectives for deploying a Department-wide innovation platform and toolkit, as well as feedback and metrics, on free and for-purchase services.  Services to include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Hackathons:</strong> An event in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges, Competitions, Prizes: </strong> Mechanisms that allows the public to solve problems for an organization and receive awards for the best solutions</p>
<p><strong>Crowd Sourcing:</strong> The practice of obtaining information or input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Design Thinking: </strong> A methodology used by designers to solve complex problems and find desirable solutions for clients.</p>
<p><strong>Round Tables:</strong> A facilitated discussion with members from outside the Department that generates ideas on a common subject.</p>
<p><strong>Big Thinks:</strong> A knowledge forum that helps organizations find smarter ideas faster by catalyzing conversations around topics most critical to business success.</p>
<p><strong>Diplomacy Lab:</strong> A public-private partnership that enables the U.S. Department of State to crowdsource research and innovation related to foreign policy challenges by harnessing the efforts of students and faculty experts at colleges and universities across the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerators:</strong> Innovative, startup funding mechanism that helps entrepreneurs with a business idea of their own and professional development.</p>
<p><strong>Incubators:</strong> Spaces that specifically target and help new and startup companies to address their needs and develop their business ideas to transform them into sustainable realities</p>
<p><br />S/GP is asking for specific industry perspectives and business models that will, if deemed in our best interest, enable S/GP to move towards a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a comprehensive innovation platform and toolkit. S/GP urges all interested parties, including the public, industry, associations, academia, small businesses, etc. to participate by providing information that would further this effort. The aim of the RFI questions is to have all available information from any and all respondents delivered to S/GP as accurately and quickly as possible. Additionally, S/GP is pursuing feedback on this draft SOO that will help to structure a critical piece of the ultimate RFP.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information</span></p>
<p>The Secretary's Office of Global Partnerships is an entry point for collaboration between the U.S. Department of State, the public and private sectors, and civil society. Launched in 2008, S/GP aims to strengthen and deepen U.S. diplomacy and development around the world through partnerships that leverage the creativity, innovation, and core business resources of partners for greater impact. S/GP works with partners across sectors, industries, and borders to promote economic growth and opportunity; to invest in the well-being of people from all walks of life; and to make democracy serve every citizen more effectively and justly.</p>
<p>S/GP recognizes that when governments engage in cross-sectoral collaboration with non-governmental partners, we leverage each other's unique individual resources, expertise, and experiences, better enabling us to create innovative solutions for the challenges impacting business, government and society.</p>
<p>The proposed innovation platform and toolkit will offer a variety of services that support innovation tools, techniques and practices, and will encourage innovation for cost savings and business ideation throughout the Department. More importantly, these types of innovation platforms have a proven track record of spurring innovation and enabling Federal agencies to:<br /><br />&bull;	Pay only for success and establish an ambitious goal without having to predict which team or approach is most likely to succeed;</p>
<p>&bull;	Reach beyond the "usual suspects" to increase the number of solvers tackling a problem and to identify novel approaches, without bearing high levels of risk</p>
<p>&bull;	Bring out-of-discipline perspectives to bear;</p>
<p>&bull;	Increase cost-effectiveness to maximize the return on taxpayer dollars; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish clear success metrics and validation protocols that themselves become defining tools and standards for the subject industry or field.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Potential Operating Constraints</span></p>
<p>Budget: The FY 2018 budget proposed by the Office of Management and Budget reduces foreign assistance funding and reprioritizes funds to make the U.S. Department of State "leaner, more efficient, and more effective." As a result, offices may be facing significant budget cuts and will have fewer funds for new programming.</p>
<p>Staffing: As a result of the negotiated budget and new administration priorities, there will likely be a shift in personnel and staffing resources. Offices may be combined, divided, or closed depending on shifts in priority.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions for Industry<br /><br /></span><br />S/GP seeks a better understanding of existing market capabilities to construct a future RFP. We ask that, in your response to this RFI, your firm provide substantive responses to as many of the following questions as applicable:<br /><br />&bull; What are your core capabilities and service offerings? Where have they been implemented?<br /><br />&bull; How long have you been in business and how many employees do you have? How many clients do you currently have?<br /><br />&bull; Is your product scalable?<br /><br />&bull; Is your product ADA compliant?<br /><br />&bull; How do you define an innovation platform and toolkit? What are the advantages and disadvantages to having an internal vs. external interface for the platform and toolkit? How do you measure if the platform is successful?<br /><br />&bull; What resources are needed to implement this platform and toolkit? How long would it take to implement and go live?<br /><br />&bull; What collaboration do you expect from your clients?<br /><br />&bull; What services would you offer to meet our business issues, as you understand them? How would you bring value?<br /><br />&bull; How do you manage customer satisfaction?<br /><br />&bull; What tools do you always use on your innovation projects? What do you charge for this? Can you quote a sample project?<br /><br />&bull; Can we use your product or does it have to be managed by a technical team? If a technical team is needed, what type of technical support is offered for your product? Does it require additional fees?<br /><br />&bull; Will your company be the administrator for this product, or can it be done remotely or by a U.S. Department of State representative?<br /><br />&bull; Will you provide training for your product exclusively to us?<br /><br />&bull; What, if any, contract/BPA vehicles do you provide these tools or services under?<br /><br />&bull; What questions haven't we asked that we should be asking? What is this draft SOO missing?<br /><br />&bull; What questions do you have of us, based on this request or the objectives listed?</p>

<CONTACT>Jenkin Cagwin, Lease Contracting Officer, Phone 617-565-6268, Email jenkin.cagwin@gsa.gov
<DESC><strong>U.S. GOVERNMENT</strong> is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in June 2017.
<p><strong>HOW TO OFFER:</strong> The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for June* is June 1, 2017 to June 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p><strong>DELINEATED AREA:</strong> All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-Reg01 and must be located within Region 1 (New England).</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p><strong>LEASE TERM:</strong> Up to 15 years.</p>

<DESC><br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).<br /><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /><br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.<br /><br />The Open Period for JUNE is JUNE 1, 2017 to JUNE 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.<br /><br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 201X or until it is replaced.<br /><br />DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-REG02 and must be located within Region 2.<br /><br />To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.<br /><br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.<br /><br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.<br /><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 201X, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 201X RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY1X AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.

The north building was originally built between 1892 and 1899 and is listed on the National Register of Historic places. A 5-story south building was originally built between 1929 and 1932, with a 2-story addition during the 1940s. The building totals 543,510 gross square feet. &nbsp;The facility is intended to remain fully functional while the facade is restored.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

This occurrence prompted a study which provided an extensive stabilization plan. Structural netting was installed in 2011 as a temporary measure to prevent similar occurrences until the facade is restored.</span></p>

The project also includes correction of failing gutters, tuckpointing, sealant repairs, and the treatment and preservation of: the exterior stone, the brick masonry, and their supporting steel structure. </span></p>

The existing structure is experiencing serious cracking and displacement at the corners of the south building, as well as the six turrets of the North Building. It must be repaired to correct for the major facade deficiencies that will prevent future disruption of operations and will make for a safer and more reliable building.

<DESC>This is a <strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong>. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary Market Research purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. <strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE.</strong> This is for <strong>Market Research only</strong>. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice. <br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from all qualified businesses concerning the potential project described below. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.<br /><br /><strong>Description/Scope of Work<br /></strong><br />The solicitation will be for a Firm Fixed Price contract (Base and 04 Option Years) and it will be advertised as a Full and Open Competition Request for Proposal (RFP). <br />The next generation Hurricane Evacuation Decision Support Platform, currently referred to as the Hurrevac Extended (HVX) prototype, is a restricted-use web-based software program funded by the Department of Homeland Security Science and Directorate, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for government emergency managers to plan, train and execute tropical cyclone decisions and evacuations. The software, access to which is available free of charge to government emergency managers, supports the ability to view and interpret tropical cyclone observations and forecasts, track hurricanes, support evacuation decision making, and provides data and information to support hurricane emergency management planning, training, and decision making. This real-time data analysis tool allows state and local emergency management officials to make prudent and informed decisions based on information developed during the National Hurricane Program (NHP) Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) process and real-time forecast data.
<p>The goal of the NHP Technology Modernization effort with respect to the integrated HVX prototype platform is to create a flexible system with new and updated technology that enables Emergency Managers (EMs) to make timely and accurate evacuation related decisions. The new system will be applicable in a variety of contexts, including evacuation studies, planning, training, and operational response and evacuation decision support. The ability to utilize HVX as a multi-purpose tool allows users to become more familiar with the interface, reducing the need for training on multiple tools and processes. Here are some of the key architecture and programmatic features of the HVX prototype: <br /><br />Utilization of a Web-based thin client architecture built with open-source software components; increasing ease of use, data collaboration and deployment and allowing for operation on mobile devices.<br />Offline capabilities that enable the EM to utilize some decision support capabilities when the system does not have connectivity to the internet. Features that will be available include:<br /><br />o The last downloaded set of hurricane tracks and forecasts (and related products such as wind rings, wind swath, watches/warnings, etc.)<br /><br />o The ability to display storm surge Maximum of Maximums (MOM)/ Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) risk mapping products/data<br /><br />o The ability to see the most recent downloaded data for their base location that allows the EM to see the potential storm surge (if produced by NHC), radar, satellite, flood outlook, rain/river/tide gages, etc.<br /><br />Creation of open-source geospatial data sharing services to maximize the available data sources and minimize the overhead of integrating new data.</p>
<p>Utilization of open-source third party applications for common GUI and algorithmic processes (Ext.js, D3.js, etc.). A sample listing is given at the end of this document.</p>

<p>A repository of HES Reports and other NHP Documents and a file sharing system to enable collaboration between users.</p>
<p>The work includes: <br /><strong><br />a. Project Management <br /></strong>The Contractor is responsible for providing the project management oversight, up to and including contractual deliverables and financial controls. The Contractor's Project Manager is one of the primary points of contact with USACE. The Contractor's Project Manager shall establish and maintain close coordination with the USACE points of contact for this SOW. Coordination may be in the form of in-person meetings, written correspondence, webinars, or telephone calls. Coordination will include a monthly In Progress Review (IPR) teleconference meeting to discuss the status of all tasks. A kickoff meeting will be held between the USACE and the Contractor within 2 weeks of the Date of Award. The Contractor shall maintain a record of all project coordination actions and shall provide copies of this record to the USACE POCs, upon request.</p>
<p><strong>b. Transferring HVX prototype system to vendor's servers <br /></strong>The Contractor shall obtain the HVX code-base provided by USACE and stand-up that software on a new set of hardware in the Contractor's environment. The contractor shall verify that the embedded unit tests pass and that external Selenium-based test procedures also pass. Once all tests pass, this verifies that the USACE HVX prototype functions as-is.<br /><br /><strong>c. Testing HVX At Scale<br /></strong>The HVX prototype operated in an environment of up to 50 concurrent users with limited lag or database issues. However, as noted in the introduction the total user base is expected to exceed 18,000 users. The Contractor shall ensure that the operational HVX platform is able to handle a potential user base in excess of 25,000 and a concurrent user experience of at least 5,000 users. While the HVX prototype did not have the full user base, the software has been integrated with Amazon Web Services, which should allow the system to be scaled readily. During the initial transition year, the contractor will be required to add beta users (names to be provided by USACE) who will test the system and functionality, and provide feedback for the contractor and USACE to address. The contractor will also be required to provide technical user support to these beta testers. Nine months after the award of the base tasks, the contractor will be required to have an operational HVX platform that can support 5,000 concurrent users. <br /><br /><strong>d. Continual Verification of Input Data Sources</strong><br />HVX utilizes a wide variety of input data streams. The nature of real-time streaming data and the rapidly changing dissemination techniques, formats and accessibility is such that the sources of specific data may need to be modified over time. In this initial transfer phase, the Contractor will be responsible for verifying that any web-based input data is still providing the expected service and that the data is injecting properly into HVX. If services or products have changed or are unavailable the Contractor will be required to find alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>e. System Control, Monitoring &amp; Recovery<br /></strong>The HVX prototype is outfitted with limited capabilities to monitor and recover instantaneously from server, algorithmic or other unexpected errors. The contractor shall build a monitoring system that allows USACE and the O&amp;M operator to detect, alert, and recover from unexpected failures. This includes monitoring of all data feeds to ensure that the injected data is being received and processed in a timely manner. The system requirement for uptime during hurricane season is 99% with a recovery buffer of 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>f. OpenAM for user authentication</strong> <br />OpenAM is an open source access management, entitlements and federation server platform. It is sponsored by ForgeRock (https://forgerock.org/openam/ ). HVX has a current set of credentials for existing users, including levels of authorization to allow restricted access to some portions of HVX. The Contractor will be provided the current database of users that are managed in OpenAM and be expected to transition the current user database into their HVX operational system. While the Contractor is strongly recommended to continue OpenAM, it may propose an alternative that USACE would have to evaluate and approve.</p>
<p><strong>g. OpenStreetMaps server/configuration<br /></strong>OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is an open-source effort that builds editable maps and an API to access map tiles for display (https://www.openstreetmap.org/about ). The HVX prototype utilized the OSM server as a way to provide highly detailed and modern maps as a base layer for the HVX map. However, the operational HVX platform will require a dedicated server in order to allow HVX to have control over the reliability, stability and customization of the maps provided. The Contractor shall stand-up an OSM dedicated server for HVX and configure the map options to meet the requirements specified by USACE/FEMA.</p>
<p><strong>h. Readiness for Transition to Operational Status</strong><br />By 12 months after the award of the base tasks, the contractor must demonstrate that the HVX prototype has been successfully transitioned from MIT-LL (the developer) to the contractor, that Tasks 1-7 have been successfully completed, and that the system is ready to be fully operational and made available to the full user base of 18,000 users. This task includes a requirement that the contractor will develop a plan, approved by USACE, to efficiently provide access to registered HURREVAC users who do already have access through the beta system. MIT-LL will be available to provide technical guidance and support to assist the contractor with the execution of tasks 1-7 and will assist the USACE in the evaluation of whether Task 8 can be considered complete. The contractor must ensure full functionality within the following internet browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 518210<br />Product Service Code: D305</p>

<CONTACT>NOEL PEREZ, CONTRACTING SPECIALIST, Phone 9104329957, Email perezn@ahqb.soc.mil - Jennifer Z. Payne, Contracting Officer, Phone 910-432-6978, Fax 910 4329345, Email Jennifer.payne@soc.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to provide industry the opportunity to identify themselves as interested sources capable of meeting the software maintenance and upgrade requirements for the WholeMan software program. The WholeMan software (aka GideonSoft or Human Capital Decision Tool) platform is a data collection and report tool that provides refined information to decision makers to make critical and timely human capital decisions. The main goals of such a system are creating quality decisions, saving time, and creating new information. The WholeMan is currently used during ARSOF Assessment &amp; Selection (A&amp;S) and is being incorporated into the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC).
<p>The initial requirement was derived around 2003, in which the 1st Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne), United States Army John F Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS) created a methodology to assess and capture candidate performance data during Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS). The Government contracted Horizon Performance, a Cary, North Carolina based small business to adapt their Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) GideonSoft proprietary software to meet the unique requirements of SFAS. This stand-alone platform came to be called the WholeMan system because it integrated all performance data collected on a candidate and provided the command a decision support tool to "select" or "non-select" the candidate thus forcing the decision maker to look at the whole person.</p>
<p>The information sought herein shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted in response to the RFI.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) has a requirement for a non-personnel service contract to provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform software license, maintenance, technical support, training of users, overlords, basic administrators, operational administrators and periodic customization for GideonSoft software program.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be required to sustain and maintain SWCS's in-place, automated and networked, holistic individual assessment system on the SOFNet network for the identified modules: Small Unit Tactics phase (SUT), Special Forces Assessment and Selection Course (SFAS), Civil Affairs Assessment and Selection Course (CAAS), Psychological Operations Assessment and Selection Course (POAS), Special Forces Officer MOS phase (18A), Robin Sage, Special Forces Orientation Course (SFOC), and Special Forces Engineer NCO MOS phase (18C).</p>
<p>Projected Period of Performance (POP) is 1 July 2017; Base Year (12 Months Period), and Option Years: Four (4), 12 Months Option Periods.</p>
<p>INTERESTED SOURCES CAPABLE OF FULFILLING THIS REQUIREMENT shall<br />submit documentation addressing all required elements listed herein; providing only a reference to a website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. All proprietary or corporate data received shall be clearly identified and shall be protected from release to sources outside the Government. Please do not submit classified material. Contractors interested in providing this service should be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p>Contractors responding to this Sources Sought are asked to provide the following information:<br />1. No more than a 5 page capability narrative explaining how the company can meet the requirements. Interested parties must also demonstrate that they are authorized to provide GideonSoft software, maintenance, and upgrades.;<br />2. Company's full name, point of contact, and address;<br />3. DUNS and CAGE number;<br />4. Applicable North American Industry Classification Standards (NAICS) and business size (whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, woman- owned, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, historically black college or university and/or minority service institute) (Respondents should advise the Government of pending changes in the business size status).</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted electronically via email to noel.perezquinones@socom.mil and jennifer.payne@socom.mil . All responses shall be submitted by 1:00 PM EST on 9 June 2017 and shall include reference number H92239-17-T-HPGS in the subject line and submission documents. Respondents are cautioned that due to file size limitations and e-mail security protocols, there is a risk that not all correspondence will be received by this office. It is the interested parties' responsibility to ensure receipt of all e-mail and faxed correspondence. If receipt has not been acknowledged within 24 hours, please contact the Contracting Office at 910- 432-3781.</p>
<p>FINAL DETERMINATION: Current market research shows that there is only one vendor capable of fulfilling the requirement however, it is the Government's intent to include responses to this RFI when making its final determination to negotiate on a sole source basis.</p>
<p>Provided no other interested sources with the capability to fulfill this requirement are identified, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg, North Carolina intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Horizon Performance, 8000 Regency Parkway, Suite 240 Cary, NC 27518.</p>
<p>Respondents will NOT be individually notified of the results however, if the final determination results in the verification of a sole source negotiation, the properly redacted Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) will be posted to the FBO site within 14 days of contract award.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">30th Contracting Squadron, Vandenberg AFB, CA intends to extend the existing Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) Contract, FA4610-12-C-C0004 on a sole source basis with an effective date of 01 Aug 17 and potentially ending 30 Nov 17, (contemplating a 2 month base and 2 one month options) to Call Henry Inc. (CHI). Reference FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Currently, the LOSC support requirements are presently being performed under the LOSC contract FA4610-12-C-0004. The current Contract FA4610-12-C-0004 is a FFP/CPFF/COST hybrid contract that expires on 31 Jul 17. There is an acquisition currently being worked by 30 CONS to award a 5-year contract for the LOSC follow-on contract on Solicitation No. FA4610-15-R-0002. Due to delays in the acquisition there is not enough time to award the new follow-on contract before the current one expires on 31 Jul 17. Due to the critical nature of the LOSC requirements which provides mission infrastructure support for the Western Range Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) which contributes to our national defense and the need for uninterrupted service, it's in the government's best interest to extend the interim contract to CHI.<br /><br />The current contract has been designated as a mission essential contract which provides for the acquisition of essential contractor services which support mission-essential functions IAW DFARS 237.7600. The goal is to ensure Real Property, Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) and facilities are maintained and operationally ready for a variety of ballistic missile, space, guided weapon, and aircraft test and evaluation missions in support of Air Force, Navy, Army, National Reconnaissance Office, Missile Defense Agency, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Energy, Defense Advanced Research Projects, National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration, and a variety of commercial, allied nations, and governmental agencies. Specific work requirements include 1) Maintenance &amp; Repair (M&amp;R) for all real property, Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), infrastructure, and equipment associated with the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS); 2) Corrosion Control to include inspecting, preparing, and executing a corrosion control plan for all real property; 3) Operations requirements consisting of activating, monitoring, configuring, or standing by on-site to run equipment as necessary for payload processing and launch operations, to include Operations of the South Vandenberg Power Plant (SVPP). The SVPP provides backup power to launch facilities during critical vehicle processing and L-1 launch activities. 4) Task Assignments which provides capability to respond to non-recurring requirements that are within scope but were presently undefined; 5) Pressure Vessels and Tanks, to include inspecting and testing; and 6) Elevators, to include inspecting, testing, certifying, maintaining and repairing all elevators in launch support buildings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mission assurance for the LOSC necessitates no breaks in service. The government cannot risk the time it would take to have another contractor become familiar with the operations and maintenance of launch facilities and infrastructures CHI's continued support and intimate knowledge of the LOSC contract requirements mitigate this. Therefore, 30th Contracting Squadron intends to extend the current contract to CHI. CHI is the only company capable of adequately providing the critical mission support in a timely manner and without an interruption in service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closing date for any responses to this proposed contract action is 15 days from posting of notice, which establishes a due date of&nbsp;09 Jun 17. Any comments to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Mr. Lenny Horniak, Contract Specialist, leonard.horniak@us.af.mil or Ms. Claudia Boga, Contracting Officer, at claudia.boga@us.af.mil.</p>

<p class="Default" style="margin-left: .5in;">B) Offerors, individuals, or interested parties who plan to attend Industry Day must provide the Contracting Officer in writing, at a minimum, full name of the attendee(s), identification of nationality (U.S. or specify other nation citizenship), Lawful Permanent Resident Numbers in the case of foreign nationals, affiliation and full office address, email, and phone number. &nbsp;&nbsp;Except for foreign nationals, the identification information must be provided at least 5 working days in advance of Industry Day. This information shall be provided as soon as possible for foreign nationals due to the longer badging and clearance processing time required. Foreign National access to the base is subject to Federal security procedures/regulations. The Government is not responsible for offerors' inability to obtain clearance within sufficient time to attend the event.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-left: .5in;">C) <strong>Due to space limitations, representation of any potential Offeror may not exceed five (5) company representatives/persons per Offeror.</strong></p>

The procurement will be conducted on a full and open basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">Due to the relationship between the two requirements and to avoid Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI), Offerors shall be limited to submitting one proposal for either SpS or SpE.&nbsp; Offerors are not allowed to submit proposals for both efforts.&nbsp; Offerors that submit one proposal that combines the SpE and SpS requirements, or multiple proposals, will not be considered.&nbsp;</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA250-17-Q-0595

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN/NCO 10, Columbus VA Ambulatory Care Center is responsible for the proposed contracting action using Purchase Request # 541-17-2-250-0287.
Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC Otolaryngology is requesting additional Endoscopies.  The size of the new/requested endoscopy equipment needs to be compatible with current market standards for in-office endoscopy, which necessitates the addition of new camera boxes/modules.  This action will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price new contract.  
Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  As a one-time purchase the following items, quantities and cost are as follows:



Wade Park ENT outpatient clinic is requesting additional endoscopies.  The current endoscopes are too large to access various parts of the sinus and nasal cavities.  This requirement will allow office endoscopic examinations for all diagnostic nasals and sinus anatomy and any disorders related to the nose/sinus.  This will include any and all postoperative monitoring, procedures and debridement.  The equipment will also be utilized for in-office ear Otologic diagnostic exams and procedures.  The estimated delivery time will be 30 days ARO.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
 ( X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Karl Storz has a reputable history and has emerged as one of the market leaders in Sino Nasal and Endoscopic equipment.  Karl Storz and their exclusive small Business Distributor, L1 Enterprises, are currently the only vendors that are capable of providing office Endoscopes with the technical specifications described in Section 3 above.  Additionally, the existing Endoscopic Tower in our clinic is of the Karl Storz brand; to be fully compatible and maintain continued and regular use of this tower, Karl Storz equipment is required. Otherwise the Veteran s Health Administration would experience substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling this requirement.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Market research was conducted by searching VetBiz, GSA Advantage, GSA eLibrary and Google.  Research was also completed by online catalog reviews.  Karl Storz is the manufacturer of this requirement and L1 Enterprises is the exclusive authorized Distributor of this requirement.

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

This is the best value option since it allows the facility to continue using all other equipment associated with this requirement.  The Contracting Officer has ensured that the offered cost is consistent with the Independent Government Cost Estimate.  In addition L1 Enterprises is offering the requirement for 10% less than Karl Storz.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

The market research conducted included a review of product catalogs, FSS and GSA.  Product research determined that there were no vendors that could supply the above mentioned Scopes that could meet the government s needs

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

n/a

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

Both Karl Storz and L1 Enterprises expressed interest in providing this requirement.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

At this time, no barriers can be removed for this requirement, but the program office will continue to evaluate and monitor the market availability of other sources which may be compatible and exchangeable with the currently owned Endoscopic Tower.


Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the US Departmentof Education's (Department), Institute of Education Sciences (IES) intends to award a single purchase order, on a sole sources basis, to&nbsp;Barron's Educational Series.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;The Department of Education requires an update to the competitiveness/selectivity index to be merged with National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data files containing information on postsecondary education institutions. College selectivity/competitive indices are used by high school students, parents, school counselors and researchers to categorize postsecondary institutions as to difficulty of being admitted. In 2008, ED purchased the Barron's index because it met the criteria needed to provide continuity of an index for longitudinal data sets dating back to 1972. NCES now needs to update the selectivity index data for the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:2009) for cohort students entering college in 2013-14. Researchers study the effects of selective/competitive institution s on student outcomes such as the probability of graduation, advanced schooling and earnings.

<RESPDATE>071217
<CONTACT>Mark Jones, Contracting Officer, Email mark.jones@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>DARPA-SN-17-49</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office (CMO), on behalf of the Information Innovation Office (I2O), intends to award a sole source contract, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, in the amount of approximately $2,800,000, to Aptima for the delivery of research support efforts for the Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program. Under the sole source contract, Aptima will ensure SD2 performers address productive challenges, discover and exploit fruitful methods (i.e., "lessons learned"), and collaborate within and across teams.</p>
<p>DARPA has a requirement for a performer to effectively elicit knowledge from domain experts across the SD2 program to establish quarterly challenge problems that drive the development of tools for data-driven design in domains that lack models. In addition, DARPA needs the performer to act as an evaluator and assess whether SD2 methods support discovery and design beyond what is otherwise possible today with significantly less human effort required, as well as to develop the technical agenda for the quarterly SD2 working meetings and ensure active collaboration among all SD2 performers. Effective execution of these tasks requires a team with a unique set of expertise including: knowledge elicitation methods, measure design, analysis of human-computer teams, and team design methods. Aptima has a unique set of capabilities that span Industrial/Organizational (I/O) psychology, team performance metric development, and practical application of knowledge elicitation techniques. Further, Aptima has an interdisciplinary staff that includes computer scientists, research scientists, I/O psychologists, and mathematicians; and more than half of Aptima's team has a PhD level technical background. Aptima personnel are adept at evaluating and fostering collaboration across research teams in numerous scientific disciplines. Combined, this unique skill set enables Aptima to adequately assess the discovery and research tasks of SD2 and to meet DARPA's requirements for the SD2 program. DARPA anticipates the period of performance will start in August 2017 and end in July 2021.</p>
<p>Work performed by Aptima will occur at SD2 Working PI Meeting locations, SD2 performer locations in Washington, DC and Boston, MA.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation for this specific requirement is currently available. However, parties may indicate their interest and identify their capability to meet the requirement by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than July 12, 2017. Submit this information to: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Mark Jones, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 675 North Randolph Street, Arlington VA 22203, or via email to Mark.Jones@darpa.mil. Questions shall be submitted to the above email address. Information received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to continue this as a sole source acquisition and to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>It is noted that DARPA's I2O Office maintains an annual Office-Wide Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking revolutionary research under several thrust areas. Parties wishing to respond to this notice are invited, as an alternative, to submit a white paper against the I2O Office-Wide BAA, DARPA-BAA-16-51.<br /><br />See attached DARPA-SN-17-49.</p>

<p>--<br />NAVSEA will hold two Industry Days in Hawaii regarding non-nuclear Surface Ship Maintenance, Repair, &amp; Modernization in Hawaii:<br />1) Tue, June 13, 2017 with ship repair small businesses and support subcontractors <br />2) Thur, June 15, 2017 with potential ship repair prime contractors (small and large)</p>
<p>The objective of these Industry Days is to engage with industry to discuss and solicit feedback/input on the navy's plans to maximize competition and small business opportunities within the non-nuclear surface ship maintenance, repair, &amp; modernization execution contracting strategy in Hawaii. <br /><br />Where: Federal Fire Department, 650 Center Drive Bldg. 284 JBPHH, HI 96860 (parking and direction maps will be provided to those who RSVP)<br />Note: This is not on a Government installation and therefore no Common Access Card (CAC) or other Government identification is required in order to attend. This venue is open and accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>Itinerary (same for both days): (other than the 8:00am start time and one-on-one session start time, all times are approximate)</p>
<p>8:00 am local time, Hawaii - general session (Government presentation) <br />9:15 am General session concludes. Industry provides written questions.<br />9:30 am - Question and answer period starts (Government to respond to written questions)<br />10:30 am - General session concludes<br />11:00 am to close of business - One-on-one sessions with the Government (as requested)</p>
<p>Note: The presentation slides will be made available prior to the industry day to those who RSVP.</p>
<p>RSVP: Interested parties are required to RSVP for each Industry Day by close of business Friday, June 2nd, 2017 by email to Steven Galer at steven.galer@navy.mil.

This is for market research purposes only to gain an understanding of current on-island capabilities.</p>
<p>One-on-one Sessions: These sessions are anticipated to be held at the Federal Fire Department. The intent of these one-on-one sessions is to provide Industry a private and non-public forum to present the Government with comments, concerns and recommendations for NAVSEA. Thus, the one-on-one sessions are designed to consist of mostly one-way communication (from the industry firm to the Government); therefore, the Government does not intend to share contract strategy information outside of the larger and/or public forum.

These sessions will be about 20 minutes in length (or more if time allows), may be attended by no more than 2 people per company, and will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis.

<p>--<br />NAVSEA will hold two Industry Days in Hawaii regarding non-nuclear Surface Ship Maintenance, Repair, &amp; Modernization in Hawaii:<br />1) Tue, June 13, 2017 with ship repair small businesses and support subcontractors <br />2) Thur, June 15, 2017 with potential ship repair prime contractors (small and large)</p>
<p>The objective of these Industry Days is to engage with industry to discuss and solicit feedback/input on the navy's plans to maximize competition and small business opportunities within the non-nuclear surface ship maintenance, repair, &amp; modernization execution contracting strategy in Hawaii. <br /><br />Where: Federal Fire Department, 650 Center Drive Bldg. 284 JBPHH, HI 96860 (parking and direction maps will be provided to those who RSVP)<br />Note: This is not on a Government installation and therefore no Common Access Card (CAC) or other Government identification is required in order to attend. This venue is open and accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>Itinerary (same for both days): (other than the 8:00am start time and one-on-one session start time, all times are approximate)</p>
<p>8:00 am local time, Hawaii - general session (Government presentation) <br />9:15 am General session concludes. Industry provides written questions.<br />9:30 am - Question and answer period starts (Government to respond to written questions)<br />10:30 am - General session concludes<br />11:00 am to close of business - One-on-one sessions with the Government (as requested)</p>
<p>Note: The presentation slides will be made available prior to the industry day to those who RSVP.</p>
<p>RSVP: Interested parties are required to RSVP for each Industry Day by close of business Friday, June 2nd, 2017 by email to Steven Galer at steven.galer@navy.mil. The RSVP shall <br />have subject line: "NAVSEA Hawaii Industry Day RSVP" and include the following information in the body of the email: <br />a) Date(s) of attendance<br />b) Indicate whether a one-on-one session (see below details) is requested with the Government and preferred date. <br />c) By date - each attendees name, company name, e-mail address, and telephone number.

The Government will follow-up on an individual basis.<br />i.

This is for market research purposes only to gain an understanding of current on-island capabilities.</p>
<p>One-on-one Sessions: These sessions are anticipated to be held at the Federal Fire Department. The intent of these one-on-one sessions is to provide Industry a private and non-public forum to present the Government with comments, concerns and recommendations for NAVSEA. Thus, the one-on-one sessions are designed to consist of mostly one-way communication (from the industry firm to the Government); therefore, the Government does not intend to share contract strategy information outside of the larger and/or public forum. Companies requesting a one-on-one session must indicate such in their RSVP email. These sessions will be about 20 minutes in length (or more if time allows), may be attended by no more than 2 people per company, and will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis. The Government will inform attendees of their scheduled one-on-one session time no later than COB Thur, June 8th, 2017. <br />Note - if no time slot remains on the preferred date identified in a RSVP, the firm will be offered a time slot on the other day, on a first come first basis.</p>
<p>General Stipulations and Disclaimers: Recording (audio or video) of the event is not permitted. Other than the planned briefing materials referenced above, the Government does not plan to provide additional information for review and comment prior to the Industry Day. This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. NAVSEA does not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee costs in response to this notice are not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government. The Government will not reimburse costs for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>This is a cross-post to Special Notice N00024-17-R-4442 under NAICS 336611, Ship Building and Repairing.
<p>The intent of this post is make ship repair support contractors aware of an invite to the Navy's ship repair industry day for non-nuclear surface ship maintenance, repair, and modernization strategy in Hawaii.</p>
<p>This post will not be further updated. Please see 4442 post for any updates at:<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DON/NAVSEA/NAVSEAHQ/N00024-17-R-4442/listing.html</p>
<p>--<br />NAVSEA will hold two Industry Days in Hawaii regarding non-nuclear Surface Ship Maintenance, Repair, &amp; Modernization in Hawaii:<br />1) Tue, June 13, 2017 with ship repair small businesses and support subcontractors <br />2) Thur, June 15, 2017 with potential ship repair prime contractors (small and large)</p>
<p>The objective of these Industry Days is to engage with industry to discuss and solicit feedback/input on the navy's plans to maximize competition and small business opportunities within the non-nuclear surface ship maintenance, repair, &amp; modernization execution contracting strategy in Hawaii. <br /><br />Where: Federal Fire Department, 650 Center Drive Bldg. 284 JBPHH, HI 96860 (parking and direction maps will be provided to those who RSVP)<br />Note: This is not on a Government installation and therefore no Common Access Card (CAC) or other Government identification is required in order to attend. This venue is open and accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>Itinerary (same for both days): (other than the 8:00am start time and one-on-one session start time, all times are approximate)</p>
<p>8:00 am local time, Hawaii - general session (Government presentation) <br />9:15 am General session concludes. Industry provides written questions.<br />9:30 am - Question and answer period starts (Government to respond to written questions)<br />10:30 am - General session concludes<br />11:00 am to close of business - One-on-one sessions with the Government (as requested)</p>
<p>Note: The presentation slides will be made available prior to the industry day to those who RSVP.</p>
<p>RSVP: Interested parties are required to RSVP for each Industry Day by close of business Friday, June 2nd, 2017 by email to Steven Galer at steven.galer@navy.mil. The RSVP shall <br />have subject line: "NAVSEA Hawaii Industry Day RSVP" and include the following information in the body of the email: <br />a) Date(s) of attendance<br />b) Indicate whether a one-on-one session (see below details) is requested with the Government and preferred date. <br />c) By date - each attendees name, company name, e-mail address, and telephone number. For the general sessions, interested parties are limited to 2 attendees per respondent/company on a first come first served basis. <br />d) Questions<br />i. Note - the Government will review questions received prior to the RSVP closing date and intends to provide answers at industry day. Questions received during industry day may not be answered.<br />e) Indicate whether or not the Government may be afforded the opportunity for a site inspection/tour of the firm's on-island facility on Wed 14 June, 2017. The Government will follow-up on an individual basis.<br />i. Note - having an on-island facility is not a pre-requisite to attend industry day and may also not be a requirement of the anticipated acquisition strategy. This is for market research purposes only to gain an understanding of current on-island capabilities.</p>
<p>One-on-one Sessions: These sessions are anticipated to be held at the Federal Fire Department. The intent of these one-on-one sessions is to provide Industry a private and non-public forum to present the Government with comments, concerns and recommendations for NAVSEA. Thus, the one-on-one sessions are designed to consist of mostly one-way communication (from the industry firm to the Government); therefore, the Government does not intend to share contract strategy information outside of the larger and/or public forum. Companies requesting a one-on-one session must indicate such in their RSVP email. These sessions will be about 20 minutes in length (or more if time allows), may be attended by no more than 2 people per company, and will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis. The Government will inform attendees of their scheduled one-on-one session time no later than COB Thur, June 8th, 2017. <br />Note - if no time slot remains on the preferred date identified in a RSVP, the firm will be offered a time slot on the other day, on a first come first basis.</p>
<p>General Stipulations and Disclaimers: Recording (audio or video) of the event is not permitted. Other than the planned briefing materials referenced above, the Government does not plan to provide additional information for review and comment prior to the Industry Day. This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. NAVSEA does not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee costs in response to this notice are not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government. The Government will not reimburse costs for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Q--Medical Consultant Use at the SSA Hearing Level
<SOLNBR>SSA-NOI-17-1008
<CONTACT>ARGIRO, ANDREW J
<DESC>BACKGROUND
The Social Security Administration (SSA) utilizes licensed contract physicians, psychologists, and speech and language pathologists to provide Medical Consultant (MC) or Psychological Consultant (PC) services. These services involve policy, quality and medical assessment (also referred to as independent review of disability claims).   Under their Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA), MCs/PCs assess and document impairment severity in SSA disability claims based on the Social Security Acts definition of disability, the regulations which interpret the law, Social Security Rulings and sub-regulatory guidance on how to evaluate evidence in disability claims.  The contractors perform an independent review of all cases provided by SSA.  The purpose of these reviews is to either determine the accuracy of the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) medical assessment; or provide a medical assessment in initial, reconsideration and continuing disability review claims

SSA also utilizes licensed contract physicians and psychologists to provide services as Medical Expert (ME) witnesses in hearings pending before the SSA Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR). Such cases involve issues under the following titles of the Social Security Act, as amended:  Title II, Disability and Title XVI, Supplemental Security Income.   MEs review paper case files, electronic case files accessed on our secure website, and/or electronic case files copied onto compact discs (CDs) and testify at hearings either in person or by video or teleconference.  

NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION
The SSA Office Disability Policy seeks to: (1) provide additional capacity for medical expertise to the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) and (2) conduct a small scale pilot to determine whether existing Medical Consultants' (MC) in various specialties and Psychiatric Consultants (PC) use at the hearing level will enhance the accuracy and consistency between disability determinations at the initial level and decisions at the hearing level.  Towards this end, BPA number SS00-16-4C067 with Homayoon Moghbeli, to provide MC services in the specialties of internal medicine and cardiology, will be modified to permit the contractor to review cases for ODAR in the capacity of a ME, provide a written response and opinions to questions and/or interrogatories, and to give oral testimony subject to cross examination.  

The acquisition will be a sole source as described at FAR 13.501(a) utilizing simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of 41 U.S.C 1901.  
Homayoon Moghbeli, as a MC, is already familiar with SSAs disability program and policies as well as the applications and tools utilized within SSA. Dr. Moghbeli will not need additional training except for orientation to ODARs process and call order procedures.  As stated above, the intent of this pilot is to determine whether existing MC and PC use at the hearing level will enhance the accuracy and consistency between disability determinations at the initial level and decisions at the hearing level.  The contractor is therefore uniquely qualified for this requirement as it is currently performing in the capacity of a MC for SSA.  Utilizing contractors that are not already SSA MCs or PCs will be of no benefit to this requirement.

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for information received. Responses to this notice must be submitted to Andrew.Argiro@ssa.gov  by Friday, June 2, 2017, 5:00 p.m. ET. Oral communications are not acceptable. The Government does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender. All questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted to the email address listed above.

<p>USSOCOM Tactical Biometrics Event 2018<br />Request for Information</p>
<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, quotations or obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services, but for planning purposes only. This RFI is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and to explore industry capabilities. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the government will arise as a result of contractor submission to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br />Responses to this RFI will be used by the USSOCOM Special Operations Force Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (SOF AT&amp;L), the Program Executive Office - Special Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Exploitation (PEO - SRSE), specifically the Program Manager - Sensitive Site Exploitation (PM-SSE) to identify potential methodologies for participation in the evaluation of next generation capabilities for biometrics identification including but not limited to the collection and on-board storage of a subjects facial photograph, iris, fingerprints and voice capture. The capability/methodology should include the potential for the transmission of the information in a Department of Defense (DoD) Electronic Biometric Transaction (EBT) file format to an onboard or national database and receive a "match or no match" response for use by the operator conducting the biometric collection activity. <br />The Tactical Biometric Event (TBE) 2018 is scheduled for March of 2018 at MacDill AFB, Tampa, Florida or Fort Bragg, NC. All hardware/equipment submitted for the evaluation shall be production models and capable of performing specific core mission sets conducted by Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE) operators either on the objective or on a forward operating base-like environment for biometric collection and identification of personnel. <br />While un-released commercial devices that meet the majority of the capabilities listed in Attachment 1 are allowed, the expectation is that all devices will be final product versions and meet the capabilities detailed in the Attachment 1 Evaluation Criteria / Requirements and Use Case Scenarios.</p>
<p>The evaluation will consist of two independently conducted events: <br />A. Technical assessment to confirm the quality and accuracy of device performance and output.<br />B. Limited user evaluations to evaluate training, determine usability and suitability for SOF operators in a realistic environment.</p>
<p>The preliminary schedule of events (subject to change) is as follows:</p>
<p>NLT 09 June 2017- Interested Manufacturer's/Vendor respond to this RFI. Responses should be submitted directly through the USSOCOM TILO portal not through the FEDBIZOPS web page and must include:<br />- identification of the Manufacturer's/Vendor primary point(s) of contact with phone and e-mail information,<br />- proposed existing or near term devices meeting TBE guidelines as described in this RFI,<br />- preferred TILO date during the first of two TILO events to be conducted from 20 - 21 June 2017 and a second TILO date to be held 17 - 19 October 2017 to demonstrate the devices. For the first TILO event white papers are acceptable with an expectation that a production-ready model will be demonstrated during the October 2017 second TILO event, and production models will be submitted for testing in March 2018.<br />Please contact the TILO office through the TILO Portal; to coordinate information submittal and request specific TILO briefing dates and times.</p>
<p>20 -22 June 2017 - Concept TILO presentations. Manufacturers/Vendors present their proposed white papers, equipment and demonstrate the equipment's capabilities of interest. TILO presentations will be conducted at the National Forensic Science Technology Center (NFSTC), 8285 Bryan Dairy Road Largo, FL. Specific coordination information will be provided if TILO briefing dates/time are scheduled.</p>
<p>30 June 2017- Invitations to select Manufacturers/Vendors to participate in the second Production Model TILO event. While HQ USSOCOM will provide feedback to all Manufacturers/Vendors who participated in the TILO presentations, only those devices that USSOCOM judges to have the best potential to meet the Attachment 1 requirements will be invited to participate in the second Production Model TILO event for the TBE.</p>
<p>17-19 October 2017- After completion of the second Production Model TILO event in October of 2017, select Manufacturers/Vendors will be asked to provide equipment for use during evaluation, train USSOCOM evaluators, and sign vendor loan agreements (VLAs) for evaluation articles. <br />1 November 2017 Manufacturer/Vendors accept invitations. Deadline for Manufacturers/Vendors to notify USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L PEO-SRSE-PM-SSE of their intent to participate in the TBE and return the completed VLAs for their devices and any associated items.</p>
<p>7 November 2017- Manufacturers/Vendors deliver (on-loan) fully functional devices and associated items for technical assessment. Manufacturers/Vendors also provide necessary technical information to support USSOCOM's safety review process.</p>
<p>13- 17 November 2017 Manufacturers/Vendors train USSOCOM testers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on the use of their device(s) to support technical evaluation of their device(s). Training will be limited to eight hours per device and must include proper use of the device and troubleshooting. Vendors will be expected to train the USSOCOM evaluators and SMEs to the point where the evaluators and SME can confirm expected levels of performance. Manufacturers/Vendors will be offered the opportunity to conduct the same training for operators participating in the Limited User Assessment portion of the TBE.</p>
<p>4-8 December 2017 USSOCOM Evaluators will conduct a technical evaluation of the Manufacturers/Vendors devices to ensure they perform to the standards and levels as presented. Manufacturers/Vendors may be asked to provide reach back support during technical evaluations.</p>
<p>12-23 March 2018 TBE. USSOCOM evaluators and SMEs conduct the TBE with the participation of SOF operational personnel. Vendors will be asked to conduct training of their capabilities/devices during the first week but will not participate in the actual operator driven events conducted jointly by USSOCOM and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), but may be asked to address questions or issues by phone or e-mail during the evaluation.</p>
<p>NLT 6 April 2018- All Manufacturer/Vendor equipment returned.</p>
<p>Once the information is received, USSOCOM may publish a synopsis requesting further information and industry comments on a refined set of requirements along with a draft acquisition strategy and milestone schedule.</p>
<p>Questions outside of the instructions above should be submitted to the Test Director, Mr. Charles A. Colletti at, charles.colletti@socom.mil with information copies to Mr Nicholas Anderson at nicholas.anderson1.ctr@socom.mil</p>
<p>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP). An RFP may be posted on FedBizOpps at some future time. However, the Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>

<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541910 (Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling) with a small business size standard of $15 million.</p>
<p>B. BACKGROUND, HISTORY AND SCOPE OF EFFORT<br />B.1 INTRODUCTION<br />In the spirit of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to enter into multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.303 to further reduce the administrative costs of acquiring comprehensive audience research services from multiple sources.<br />Blanket Purchase Agreements reduce contracting costs such as searching for sources, the development of technical documents, drafting complex solicitations, and the evaluation of multiple bids and offers. This BPA will further decrease costs, reduce paperwork, and save time by eliminating the need to conduct repetitive, individual procurements. The end result is to create a purchasing mechanism for the Government that works better and costs less.<br />B.2 AGENCY BACKGROUND<br />The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an independent Federal entity that is responsible for U.S.-funded non-military international broadcasting of news and information to audiences around the world. It derives its authority from The International Broadcasting Act of 1994, 22 U.S.C 6201 et seq., The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. 105-277 &sect;&sect; 1301 et seq., The Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, Pub. L. 80-402, as well as other statutes and executive orders. Based in Washington, DC, the BBG oversees a combination of federal and private broadcast entities. On the federal side, BBG oversees, through an umbrella organization called the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), the Voice of America (VOA), and Radio and TV Marti (referred to collectively as the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB). VOA is headquartered in Washington, DC. OCB is located in Miami, FL. The BBG also issues and supervises grants to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL, Inc.) located in Prague, Czech Republic; Radio Free Asia (RFA, Inc.) located in Washington, D.C.; Alhurra and Radio Sawa, which are part of the Middle East Broadcasting Network (MBN), headquartered in Springfield, Virginia. <br />While consistent with the BBG&lsquo;s overall mission to promote freedom and democracy through accurate, objective and balanced news and information&#8214;, each of these entities has its own unique mission under the law, and collectively they account for over 278 million regular listeners, viewers, and online content users around the world. Broadcasts take place in over 60 languages, and programs are delivered via an increasingly complex array of multi-media platforms, including Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM) radio, shortwave, satellite and terrestrial Television (TV), Internet (including social media), Short Message Service (SMS), and even face-to-face events. <br />In coming years, the BBG expects to accelerate its market driven shift to digital platforms, which will have important implications for the BBG's research program and will require new approaches to traditional research methods. Offerors are strongly encouraged to study the "Performance Information" section of the BBG's most recent Performance and Accountability Reports (available on www.bbg.gov ) to gain a better understanding of some of the data points required from the International Audience Research Project (IARP).<br />B.3 PROGRAM BACKGROUND<br />The BBG, like all federal agencies, is required to show evidence of performance and effectiveness, including its impact. Common measures such as audience reach and reliability of programming have long served the BBG in assessing the impact of our media on populations, and future studies under the IARP Multiple BPA Awards (qualitative) will have an increased focus on impact assessment, as defined by achieving the BBG mission. Research is also used to drive strategic and program planning within the agency. Information about media markets, trends in technology adoption and audience demographics and preferences inform these efforts. Since 2001, the International Audience Research Program (IARP) has supplied the agency with the business intelligence required for both performance measurement and planning through intensive study of broadcaster markets and audiences. Yet another element of the IARP research program is the evaluation of individual programs and audiences' content and format preferences in order bring actionable intelligence to BBG content producer to plan new or to fine-tune current programming.<br />In order to meet the continuing needs of the agency, the Government intends to award a multiple award BPA during Fiscal Year 2017. The choice of a BPA, in which a group of Contractors will respond to Request for Proposals (RFP) for call orders issued by the BBG for individual studies, the number and value of which have yet to be determined, is intended to offer the agency the flexibility it requires in a global research program that must be responsive to fast-changing environments. The Contractors selected will provide the BBG with regular, current and accurate audience and market research from approximately 30-70 countries per year through a combination omnibus surveys, qualitative research and other analysis studies. The BBG will engage third-parties (who cannot perform any IARP-related tasks for BPA holders) to perform additional data quality control (including recodes), and to maintain a master survey questionnaire.<br />While current measures will continue to be vital to the research program, the goal is to further evolve beyond them in ways that will help the agency and its broadcasters understand more about how sub-national markets are functioning, motivations behind the media behavior of target (in addition to existing) audiences, the impact of media beyond the individual consumer, creating compelling content that is market-appropriate, extending reach across target markets, and responding to the increasing and changing requirements for performance measures by Federal oversight authorities.<br />BBG anticipates several changes to the IARP. They include the need for: 1) a closer correlation between research questions and broadcaster mission, 2) a deeper understanding of target audiences beyond standard demographics, 3) more frequent reviews of appropriate performance measures, and 4) increased media and program consulting services to ensure research directly supports program improvement. The factors that will drive these changes include the digital revolution, enhanced Congressional and Executive Oversight of performance and impact, greater data access and integration across government, and the need for transparency in performance measurement. <br />Statutory Requirements for Audience Research</p>
<p>Applicable law requires that the BBG conduct audience research. These laws include:<br />The International Broadcasting Act of 1994, 22 U.S.C 6201 et seq., which requires the BBG to:</p>
<p>&bull; Review language services and make decisions to add or delete language services at least annually;<br />&bull; Ensure that the quality of broadcasts conforms to applicable statutory standards;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that the broadcasts reach significant audiences; and</p>
<p>&bull; Use audience research as the basis for its decision-making.<br />The Government and Performance Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), Pub. L. 103-62 mandates that all federal entities set goals and establish performance measures to indicate progress or lack of progress in meeting these goals. These results must be reported to Congress annually. At this time, the majority of GPRA performance measures for BBG depend at least in part on in- country surveys; for all measures currently used in the Performance Accountability Report (PAR) see https://www.bbg.gov/strategy-and-performance/performance-accountability/ The Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) is required to satisfy the reporting requirements of six pieces of legislation enacted from 1986-2002, including GPRA and the Reports Consolidation Act. It combines performance and audited financial information intended to assist Congress, the President and the public in assessing the BBG&lsquo;s performance relative to its mission and stewardship of the resources entrusted to it.<br />The PAR features BBG performance indicators required by GPRA. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), who frequently audits implementation of GPRA, requires that these measures be generated by means of a bona fide sample with all appropriate documentation as to sampling error and design effects, if clustering is used, where feasible. With the nature of broadcasting and media consumption changing so rapidly, the fragmentation of media audiences is now a reality in nearly all but the most undeveloped markets, and the increasing interest in demonstrating effectiveness in support of BBG and broadcaster missions, the agency foresees the possibility of amending GPRA performance measures during the life of a new research contract. BBG plans to award contract(s) that will be flexible enough to allow for the design of new methods of measuring and reporting performance.<br />The combined impact of these legislative and other forces affecting U.S. International Broadcasting has greatly enhanced the importance of audience research. While such research should always be structured flexibly enough to respond to a changing marketplace, performance reporting requires that research findings be available on time and in BBG specified formats, since the results must meet certain predetermined milestones every year. These milestones include:<br />&bull; Mandated annual deadlines for delivery of GPRA and PAR documents to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress;<br />&bull; At least annual Language Service Review and annual Strategic Process.<br />&bull; At least one program review for each language service each year by some of the BBG broadcasters;</p>
<p>Alternatively, in other countries that are increasingly closed to outside researchers, methods for estimating critical broadcast research variables require continuous development and ingenuity.<br />More information on the structure of U.S. International Broadcasting can be found at the following websites:<br />BBG - www.bbg.gov<br />VOA - www.voanews.com<br />Radio/TV Marti - www.martinoticias.com<br />RFE/RL - www.rferl.org<br />RFA -www.rfa.org<br />Radio Sawa - www.radiosawa.com<br />Alhurra TV - www.alhurra.com</p>
<p>B.4 SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of the BPA includes the conduct of all required audience and market research for the BBG, its entities - both federal and grantee - including all broadcasting organizations that the BBG supervises, to include a total of over 60 language services broadcasting worldwide. The BBG and its entities will require varying combinations of qualitative and other research.<br />B.5 OBJECTIVES<br />The objective of this procurement is to award BPAs to multiple vendors under multiple task areas in support of developing a program of regular, current, accurate audience research to be conducted by contractors. The objectives of the desired research program are:<br />&bull; To satisfy the requirements of the agency&lsquo;s statutory framework, which stipulates that BBG use audience research as a basis for decision-making. (This decision-making includes general oversight, as well as annual reports on performance to OMB and Congress and an annual review of broadcast languages to consider additions and deletions of programming and language services, as described above.);</p>
<p>&bull; To meet the needs of professional broadcasting management. (The BBG recognizes that current, accurate, comprehensive audience research is essential to professional broadcasting, and that the language services of all the broadcasting entities must have access to a wide range of audience and market research to, among other things: discern media habits and how they are changing, identify and/or describe target audiences, understand content preferences, provide input to format changes, transmission requirements, and distribution opportunities, including local FM/AM, television, and digital affiliations);</p>
<p>&bull; To enable BBG to have consistent, accurate, reliable measurements of broadcast effectiveness, impact, and quality so that the components of a GPRA mandated Strategic Plan and Performance Plan can be enacted and applied at all levels of management in all the entities;,</p>
<p>&bull; To support the BBG in its collaborative relationships with other international broadcasters and U.S. Government agencies in the field of shared research;<br />&bull; To provide objective research on issues such as program quality and relevance in a timely manner in the direct support of approximately 75 individual program reviews conducted by several of the BBG's entities annually.</p>

These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of the end of the ordering period.<br />(End of clause)<br />F. EVALUTION PROCEDURE and BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>F.1. Phased Solicitation-Evaluation Procedure<br />The Government will use the following procedure to select multiple BPA awardees. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section, including an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each proposal. The results of the evaluation of each proposal will be provided to the Contracting Officer (CO) to support the award decision.<br />Due to the number of proposals that the BBG anticipates receiving in response to this solicitation, in order to relieve prospective offerors and the agency of the administrative cost and burden of offeror-drafting and submission, and agency evaluation of numerous and voluminous proposal submissions and information, the agency will conduct evaluations for this procurement using a phased evaluation approach by which the agency will solicit and evaluate proposal information in two phases.<br />The agency will solicit and evaluate proposal information in two phases to progressively reduce the number of offers being considered for contract award. The agency will execute the procedure as follows:<br />1. The agency will not determine technical acceptability or conduct a price analysis during the first phase of the evaluation procedure. This is a FAR Part 13 procurement; the decision to eliminate any offeror through this procedure will not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, as described in FAR 15.306[c], and it will not obligate the agency to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p>2. First we will evaluate on a pass/fail basis Offerors' capability (knowledge, experience and expertise) based on Offerors' responses to the solicitation's three (3) assessment questions using the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. Pass - Offeror response provides us with moderate to high degree of confidence in the offeror's capability to perform the required work successfully.</p>
<p>b. Fail - Offeror response provides us with a no to low degree of confidence in the offeror's capability to perform the required work successfully.</p>
<p>3. We will eliminate from further consideration offerors whose proposals receive a Fail rating during the first phase - the agency will not consider for award any offeror whose proposal provides the agency with no to low degree of confidence in the offeror's capability to perform the required work successfully, regardless of price or past performance considerations.</p>
<p>4. For the second phase of the evaluation, the agency will provide additional solicitation information directly to all offerors not otherwise excluded from the competition during the first phase of the evaluation procedure. We will evaluate offers for technical acceptability during this phase and we will evaluate past performance.</p>
<p>a. The additional solicitation information will include a corresponding request for additional proposal information, which the agency will evaluate against additional technical factors, such as the Offeror's management plan, its QA/QC plan, and its experience on contracts of similar scope and complexity.</p>
<p>b. The additional solicitation information will also include sample call orders that are representative of the type of work that the agency will order, for which Offerors will be required to submit responses that we will evaluate to assess the contractor's understanding of the work, its labor/resource mix effectiveness, and to conduct the required price analysis.</p>
<p>5. First we will conduct a price analysis of Offeror responses to sample call orders to determine whether prices are fair and reasonable, and realistic for the described work. After we perform the price analysis, we will eliminate Offerors whose prices we consider to be too low to be realistic, or too high to be considered reasonable or competitive in light of the prices offered by other Offerors and our independent estimate of price.</p>
<p>6. Second we will evaluate Offerors' past performance. The agency will evaluate past performance references to the maximum extent practicable. Past performance considerations shall include, but not be limited to, a Contractor's performance in terms of timeliness, quality of deliverables, and cost control on previous contracts.</p>
<p>7. The agency will use the results of the past performance evaluation to determine its level of confidence in Offerors' ability to successfully perform the requirements of the contract. We will not give further consideration to any Offeror whose proposal gives the agency low confidence in the Offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully.</p>
<p>8. Lastly we will evaluate the remaining Offerors' management plans, QA/QC plans, and experience on contracts of similar scope and complexity and will eliminate any that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for contract award.</p>
<p>9. Once we have reduced the number of offerors to what we consider to be an appropriate number the agency may negotiate with none, some or all of the remaining Offerors, schedule oral presentations by the remaining Offerors, or proceed to select for award a reasonable number of Offerors for each technical task area by comparing those Offerors on the basis of their management plans, experience, past performance, understanding of the work, and price, and make an award without discussions.<br />F.2. Phase One (I) Assessment Questions and Submission Instructions<br />For the first phase of the agency's phased evaluation procedure, interested Offerors are required to respond to the assessment questions in this section to allow the Government to assess each Offeror's capability (knowledge, experience and expertise) in the relevant subject matter.<br />Written inquiries must be received by BBG/IBB, no later than May 31, 2017, 12:00 PM., Eastern Daylight Savings Time (DST), to Seneca Belinfontie, Contract Specialist, at CONSOL@bbg.gov.<br />Phase One (I) written response to assessment questions below are due June 5, 2017 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br />The BBG/IBB, will only accept written communications; no verbal communications will be accepted.

All questions must be received by June 5, 2017, 12:00PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br />F.3. Phase Two (II) Solicitation-Evaluation Plan<br />Offerors are advised not to proceed with this section until the agency notifies it that the Offeror has remained in the competition and has provided it with additional solicitation information.<br />For the second phase of the evaluation process, the agency will provide additional solicitation information directly to all offerors not otherwise excluded from the competition during the first phase of the evaluation procedure. Offerors competing in the second phase will be required to submit responses to the additional solicitation information if they wish to remain under consideration for award. The Government will evaluate the proposals in against the following five (5) criteria.<br />a) Management Plan, organization and staffing structure: Offerors' proposed plan to successfully manage the tasks and as many of the activities within the five (5) Contract Task Areas as Offeror's wish to bid on, including a full description of the corporate capabilities it will bring to bear specifically in support of same, the nature of any teaming arrangements, the organizational and staffing structure proposed, including roles, lines of authority and the identification of individuals proposed to work full-time on the contract and those proposed as</p>
<p>Key Personnel. Offerors must demonstrate that proposed personnel has the requisite professional experience as evidenced by resumes/Curriculum Vitaes (CVs) for those in key and senior roles and/or a skills matrix for junior roles. Experience includes both the technical skills relevant to the five (5) Contract Task Areas Offerors wish to bid on, and expertise in the languages, cultures and markets in which the agency broadcasts. If Offerors constitutes a team of multiple organizations, then their proposals must identify the organizational affiliation in each element of the Management Plan.</p>
<p>b) Offerors' Experience: Offeror's verifiable past experience in conducting media and audiences related social science research and analysis, which must include description of tasks, methodologies used, deliverables, value of contract, and client contact information. The Offeror's demonstrated ability to deliver services to the Federal Government in Task Areas on which they wish to bid. Experience could be evidenced by samples of past work, such as analytic reports, research instruments and/or protocols, links to public-facing web portals, etc., which may or may not be media-related. Experience should be clearly evidenced across all key aspects of BBG requirements including research design, presentation and an analysis of findings, data management, etc. If Offerors constitutes a team of multiple organizations their proposals must identify experience by organization. Offeror's Knowledge of Best Practices - Offeror's understanding of the challenges of conducting qualitative and quantitative media research in target markets and quality of solutions to address these challenges.</p>
<p>International experience including difficult to access areas: Offerors' verifiable ability and experience in conducting research in BBG target markets (in particular the countries listed for Task Areas 1 and 2) with a focus on a) accessing difficult to research populations and b) experience in applying creative approaches to challenging research environments. Difficulty can be defined by geographical remoteness, socio-linguistic or political factors. Offerors must graphically display countries in which it can operate, clearly distinguishing among own capabilities and working through subcontractors. This includes in-depth expertise in the political, social, linguistic and cultural fields in regions targeted by the BBG. If Offerors constitutes a team of multiple organizations, then their proposals must identify global reach by organization.</p>
<p>c) Past Performance: The Offeror's Technical proposal shall contain detailed information on past performance and relevant contracts for same or similar services with a minimum of three (3) reference including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and email addresses (i.e., the point of contact who can verify the Offeror's past performance). The agency will evaluate the Offeror's past performance pursuant to FAR 15.305(a)(2). Pursuant to FAR 15.305(a) (2) (iv), in the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror will be evaluated as neutral. <br />d) QA/QC Plan: Offerors' quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plan it proposes to implement on the Contract, based on QA/QC policies it has used in past research adapted to the rigors of agency requirements as described in the SOW. The Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the factors that contribute to high quality research, including the elements of sampling (from frame development through selection protocols in surveys and respondent recruitment in qualitative research), field training and oversight, data/insights, capture and processing, data/insights cleaning and verification checks and accuracy of analysis and reporting.</p>
<p>e) Technical Approach and Price for Sample Call Orders: Offerors' proposed technical and managerial approach required to complete the sample call orders under which the offeror wishes to be considered. Interested offerors shall also provide a Price Proposal showing a price breakdown for performance of the sample call orders for the Task Areas under which they wish to be considered for award. The prices shall be provided in English and United States dollars. The agency will evaluate the total price for completeness and reasonableness prior to making an award.</p>

Additionally, Offerors are advised that an award resulting from this RFP may be subject to the availability of funds in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds.</p>
<p>G.7 BASIS FOR AWARD<br />After evaluating all responsive offers and considering proposed prices, technical information, and past performance information, the Broadcasting Board of Governors will make its award decision based on a process of trade-offs to identify the proposals that represent the best value to the Government. In doing so, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and management capabilities than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to Government. Accordingly, an award will be made to the offeror(s) whose proposal(s) is/are responsive to the Government's requirements and is/are technically superior to the other offers received, the price or cost of which may or may not be the lowest. <br />Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the Government reserves the right to accept other than the technically superior offer if the price of the technically superior offer is so great that the additional cost to the Government is considered to outweigh the benefit the Government could potentially receive from the offer's technical superiority; i.e., the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical skills. In the eventuality that such an offer is received, the Government will consider the next technically superior offer for award and will continue to repeat this process until it identifies the proposal that provides the greatest overall value to the Government, technical, price and other factors considered.<br />Offers which are unrealistic in terms of technical approach or unrealistically low or high in cost(s) or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competency or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements and may be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are reminded to include their best technical and price terms in their initial offer and not to automatically assume that they will have an opportunity to submit a revised offer.</p>

I. General Description 
 The Contractor shall furnish board certified Interventional Radiologists with Fellowship training in Interventional Radiology to provide coverage in the absence of the full-time VAMC Interventional Radiologists.  

 1. On-Call Coverage for Interventional Radiology Services - The Contractor will provide on-call consultation coverage in the absence of the Memphis VA Medical Center (VAMC) staff Interventional Radiologists during weeknights (Monday through Thursday from 4:30 PM to 8:00 AM), weekends (4:30 PM Friday through 8:00 AM Monday), holidays and periodic vacation days. The Interventional Radiologists shall perform and interpret emergency specialized procedures that require the expertise of an Interventional Radiologist.  The physician(s) care shall cover the range of services as would be provided in a state-of-the-art civilian medical treatment facility and the standard of care shall be of a quality, meeting or exceeding currently recognized national standards as established by The American College of Radiology.

  a. Consultation services requested from the VA Emergency Department - Consultation services requested from the VA Emergency Department are expected to be made on-site at the Memphis VAMC in a timely manner, as agreed upon with the consulting physician, unless the requesting provider determines that an initial telephone consultation is sufficient. All on-site Emergency Department consultations will be documented in the Computer Patient Record System (CPRS).

  b. Consultations services requested for VA hospitalized patients - Consultation services for VA hospitalized patients include direct (on-site, in-person) care of new consults, as deemed appropriate by the primary team.  Response to the initial call is expected within 30 minutes.  Consultation services necessitating direct care are expected to be seen on-site at the Memphis VAMC in a timely manner, as agreed upon with the consulting physician.  Consultation services for VA hospitalized patients also includes inpatient follow-up, as determined by the Memphis VAMC staff Interventional Radiologist Attending or Primary Team.  The Contractor will continue to provide inpatient follow-up through the coverage period if clinically required.  All on-site inpatient consultations/rounding will be documented in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).

 c. Abnormal/Critical Findings: The contractor shall identify and communicate emergent test results to the patient's ordering practitioner or to the practitioner's surrogate or supervisor as appropriate. Document the time and means of such communication, and the name of the practitioner contacted, in the medical record. Important findings that require emergent attention will be immediately and directly communicated to the patient's treating practitioner. A finding will be judged emergent by the contractor radiologist if the finding has the potential to be life threatening or could cause serious harm, and requires a rapid intervention or change in patient management. Direct communication consists of a face to face or telephone conversation for immediate life threatening findings. The time and means of such communication, and the name of the person contacted, will be entered into the dictated radiographic report. The contractor will ascertain that the communication has been understood. If the ordering practitioner cannot be contacted, the report will be directly communicated to the practitioner's surrogate or to the other responsible, ER provider, or to floor nurse, ICU nurse or supervisory nurse. Suitable surrogates include the practitioner's supervisor or preceptor, or another practitioner who may take further, appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic action.     

2. Transfer of Care/Hand-off Dialogue   It is expected that a transfer of care/hand-off dialogue will take place between the Memphis VAMC staff Interventional Radiologists and the Contractor s physician on-call.  At the beginning of the on-call coverage period, the Memphis VAMC staff Interventional Radiologists  will contact the Contractor s on-call physician to discuss any inpatient who will need direct care follow-up during the coverage period.  Likewise, at the end of the coverage period, the Contractor s on-call physician will contact the Memphis VAMC staff to discuss new consults and follow-up cases seen during the coverage period.  This communication is expected to be made by 8:00 AM the morning the coverage period ends.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-95.</p>
<p>This requirement is 100% small business set-aside. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The small business size standard is $15M. This acquisition is conducted under FAR 13.106 under simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) was designed with exacting specifications for the contaminant emissions from the building materials. Specifically, these materials were selected to have low emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). During the first year of operation of the house, airborne VOC levels were measured approximately monthly in order to verify the effectiveness of these specifications and to study the VOC emissions in the newly constructed building. In the second and third years of operation VOC concentrations were measured quarterly. Since that time, the operation of the house and its systems has been modified. In order to understand the impacts of these changes and to build on the information collected during the first three years of sampling, NIST requires assistance in the analysis of additional air samples to determine how the key VOCs in the house have continued to change over time. Please see the attached solicitation for more details.</p>

The terms contract, contractor, and Contracting Officer shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.5071, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Equip: 
POC: Joseph Nickels x5897





1.0 Scope of Work (Purpose)

In Cardiology and Gastroenterology, stretchers are used intra-procedurally. In the Emergency Room, stretchers provide a destination for patients to be admitted and seen by the medical and clinical staff. Workflow processes that maximize efficiency and patient safety are as follows:
In Cardiology and Gastroenterology the patient is admitted to a pre/post procedure bay and is prepped for the procedure on a stretcher (IV start, Changed into gown, patient assessment, and so on). In the Emergency Department, the patient is admitted to the patient bay and positioned on the gurney which provides many of the same benefits as in Cardiology and Gastroenterology with additional security features found with the integrated exit alarms.
Patients are wheeled into procedural areas for their procedures where conscious sedation and or anesthesia are administered.
 At the conclusion of a procedure the patient is wheeled back into the Pre/Post procedure care area for recover and discharge.
The workflow benefit gains that result from good stretcher utilization are:
Minimize patient transfers thus reducing patient risk of fall.
Reduced risk of staff injuries that result from patient transfers.
Improved patient comfort and satisfaction.
Improved productivity and efficiency of departments because time used for transferring and positioning patients is reduced.  

 In accordance with Appendix A, Handbook 6500.6 Checklist block 6, the C&A requirements do not apply to this requirement, and Security Accreditation Package is not required. In accordance with Appendix A, Handbook 6500.6 Checklist block 7, Due to the non-technical nature of this requirement there is no information to be protected.  

The period of performance will be 30 days after receipt of award.

Description of how the equipment being requested operates:

In Cardiology and Gastroenterology, stretchers are used intra-procedurally. In the Emergency Room, stretchers provide a destination for patients to be admitted and seen by the medical and clinical staff. 

Where will the equipment being requested be used:

Cardiology is developing, with the support of senior leadership a pre/post procedure care unit for Cath Lab and Cardiology procedures in the 6 patient care bays (E411I, E411J, E411K, E411L, E411M, and E411N) as well as the Cardiac Cath Lab room #4123.
Gastroenterology Department procedure room (D611, D613, D615, D617, D618, D621, D622) and pre and post procedure (D612)
Emergency Department is building a new 21 bay unit that has no room number designations as of yet.

Who will be using the equipment: 

Nursing and Medical staff as well as transportation services

Justification:
Gastroenterology Department:
  Increased work load from a capacity of approximately 25 patients to 40 per day =200+ a week
  Need pre-op weight for every procedure. Approximately 25% of patient are wheelchair-bound or fall risk. Using the integrated scale instead of the traditional upright scale will decrease the change of patient fall as well as staff injury.
  Currently 13 gurneys on hand but requesting 10 additional for a total of 23 to accommodate patient load which will allow pre-procedure work up expediting patient flow.
Cardiology Pre/Post Procedure Care:
  Currently outpatients are transferred to  short stay  beds on the Telemetry floor. This represents as much as 80% of the short stay volume on telemetry on any given day. In order alleviate this potential barrier to more appropriate admissions, a proposal has been approved by leadership to repurpose the 6 patient care bays in E411 as pre and post procedure care for cardiology.
  Improved clinical workflow in the Cath Lab with prepped and ready for Cath Lab procedures on a stretcher that can be wheeled directly into the procedure room and transferred directly to the exam table.
  These bays will also be used for other cardiology procedures such as transesophageal echocardiograms, cardioversions, and a holding area for clinic patients awaiting inpatient beds, and so on.
  All cardiac cath patients require a pre-procedure weight to be entered into the hemodynamic system prior to the start of the procedure.
  Currently there is one motorized stretcher in the Cath Lab requesting an additional seven to augment the existing one as well as six more to occupy the six bays in E411.
Emergency Department:
  Facilitate safe transport of patients to and from procedural areas in the hospital
  Transport of patients to admitting wards.
  Need to weigh patients for safe calculations of medications for titration doses.
  New emergency department with 21 bays for patient care (room numbers not available at this time).
  Many patients seen are unsteady; using the integrated scale will reduce the risk for patients falling and reduce the risk for staff injury.
  The intergraded exit alarms provide an additional layer of patient safety in the prevention of elopement.
3.0 Delivery and Shipping Information: The contractor shall provide the following for shipment and delivery of equipment:

All items shall be shipped to the following location:

Other technical quotes may not be evaluated, unless the Government determines the lowest price offeror to be unacceptable or non-responsive. In the event the Government determines the lowest price offeror to be unacceptable, the technical quote of the next lowest price offeror will be evaluated. This process will continue until a technical quote is determined to be acceptable.

<DESC>Phase 1 of the Solicitation is hereby issued.
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is a FAR Part 15 Competitive Negotiation, Price-Technical Trade-Off, full and open acquisition to repair and renovate Hanger 8 at Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Texas. The North American Industrial Classification System code is 236220, which has a size standard of $36.5 million. A firm-fixed-price contract will be negotiated. The contract is anticipated to be approximately awarded in November 2017. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM Internet site at https://www.sam.gov/. No state level certifications will be accepted.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Construction range is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. This contract is a Design Build for the repair and renovation of Hanger 8 at Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Texas. Hangar 8, constructed in the 1940's by the Department of the Navy, is a 74,200 SF facility, designed to maintain pre-World War II fixed wing aircraft. The Hangar Bay section will require extensive renovation efforts to meet local, state and national building codes to include support facility requirements for an Aviation Depot level of repair, and overhaul of Department of Defense rotary wing aircraft. This project will facilitate an effective and efficient layout to support production requirements. The work proposed in Hangar 8 will include but is not limited to the removal of all lead based paint from the walls, truss system, abatement by encapsulation of any lead containing paint on the wood deck, and repainting the metal truss system, structural members, walls and wood decking.<br /><br />The roof has deteriorated due to its age and exposure to coastal weather conditions. During rains, the roof leaks onto structural members and shop operations below. Water infiltration has deteriorated the hangar's truss system, other structural members, and roof decking. Repair of the hangar is needed to prevent further damage to the building, minimize downtime for shop operations, and increase the output of repaired aircraft. This project repairs the roof of 60,400 square feet of high bay maintenance area and repairs the exterior bay walls. Exterior work will include replacement of the roofing system with a new roofing system and replacement of the exterior bay aluminum siding walls and metal flashing.</p>
<p>The repair will also consist of replacing roof access ladders; painting the floor with a slip resistant coating; repairing and upgrading the electrical distribution system, the communication system, compressed air distribution system, fire suppression system, heating control system. This service life extension project will increase the hangar's serviceability for at least twenty years, as Hangar 8 is critical to Army's only Aviation Depot Level Maintenance production where aircraft production space is limited. Army Working Capital Funds support funding for this project. This project scope will comply with the Army Installation Design Standard (IDS) Chapter 3 and Mold Remediation in accordance with TG 277 and TG 278, Facilities Management Information Document on Mold Remediation Issues and Industrial Hygiene/Preventive Medicine Mold Assessment</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, supplies, and transportation necessary to perform the repair and renovation of Hanger 8 at Corpus Christi Army Depot as specified in the Statement of Work/Plan/Specifications that will be attached to the future Request for Proposal (RFP). All work shall comply with all State, local and Federal laws and regulations, and applicable code requirements.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with United Security &amp; Communications, Inc. (USCI), located in Lothian, MD for security system maintenance services.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This service will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.&nbsp; As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The University is currently in a phased process for a complete overhaul of the CCTV System and Access Control System that is bringing in new contractors. While this project is going on, the current system will be in use maintaining the security of the University. USCI has been a vital asset concerning the current systems in use at USUHS and is familiar with said system, the University, and the installation for over seven years. Keeping USCI as our maintenance technicians during this transition would greatly benefit the University and help the new project flow seamlessly. USCI&rsquo;s intimate knowledge of the entire system will be key and very important to the incumbent contractor during the phased and incremental upgrade of the entire system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">USCI is the only known source that can maintain the current system.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.<br />Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  <br />The OTI program in Libya will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future State Department and USAID presence in Libya. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition in Libya. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings within the Libyan External Office (LEO), host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; As requested by Embassies or USAID, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model. Support to the Libya External Office and other USAID programs may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming, including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 4) security concerns, 5) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives, and 6) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other related duties as determined by the Country Representative or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. The incumbent is expected to proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Tunisia, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Tunisia, the work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, freedom of movement restrictions can vary greatly depending on the assigned location in-country.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is AG-3604-S-17-0021 and it is a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular current to FAC 2005-83.<br /><br />The NAICS Code for this project is 541191 with a size standard of $11.0 Million. All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) - previously Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ as required by FAR 4.1102. Also, contractors who receive a federal contract of $25,000.00 or more are required by legislation to submit an annual VETS-100 Report on your employment of targeted veterans. Information on submitting your report may be obtained by calling 703-461-2460 or by accessing the following Internet web site: http://vets.dol.gov/vets100/.<br />&emsp;<br />Contract Line Items are as follows:<br />BASE PERIOD<br />Line Item 001 Parcel &amp; Owner Data (50 States, including Washington, DC)<br />OPTION PERIOD 1<br />Line Item 002 Parcel &amp; Owner Data Updates/Annual Maintenance (50 States, including Washington, DC)</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work for Ownership Data Retrieval Service</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, with the Forest Service's Research and Development branch, is charged with conducting an ongoing, comprehensive inventory of the nation's forest resources. This work involved inventorying the trees and environmental attributes on a series of over 100,000 fixed inventory plots and revisiting these plots once every five to ten years. These plots are randomly located using a statistical sampling protocol and most of the plots are on private lands, as most of the forest in the U.S. is privately owned.</p>
<p>On an annual basis, FIA inventories a subset of these inventory plots. In order to classify the ownership of the plot and ask for permission to visit the plot, it is necessary to gather name and address information for owners of where the plots are located. It is also often necessary to identify owners of surrounding lands needing to be crossed to access the plots. This process is time consuming and to date the bulk of this information gathering has required in-person visits to county courthouses and other municipal offices.<br /><br />As parcel data has become more commonly available in digital format, it is believed that time and monetary savings, in addition to increased accuracy, can be realized by the purchase of services that allow us to access the data from a commercial vendor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specifications</span></p>
<p>Statewide parcel data is desired for all 50 US states (to include the District of Columbia (D.C.)). Ideally there will be 100% coverage for all land parcels. While realizing there will be gaps in the coverage, we are interested in minimizing these gaps to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>Land ownership changes over time and the degree to which the data provided are up-to-date is important. Within all feasibility, all data should be no more than one year old.</p>
<p><br />The desired data will be: <br />&bull; Contained in a single ArcGIS shapefile or geodatabase that includes parcel polygons with associated attribute information denoting all property owners and property and mailing addresses and any other available contact information (e.g., phone numbers or email addresses). These data will be shared with appropriate FIA personnel via the corporate Forest Service corporate GIS system.<br />&bull; Land owner information (i.e. variables) should contain at a minimum: <br />o Company/Organization (for companies and organizations)<br />&#61607; Company/Organization Name<br />&#61607; Contact person (where available)<br />o Name(s)<br />o Property address:<br />&#61607; Street Address Line 1/PO Box<br />&#61607; Street Address Line 2<br />&#61607; Street Address Line 3<br />&#61607; City/Town <br />&#61607; State abbreviation<br />&#61607; Zip code<br />&#61607; Country (for addresses outside US)<br />o Mailing address:<br />&#61607; Street Address Line 1/PO Box<br />&#61607; Street Address Line 2<br />&#61607; Street Address Line 3<br />&#61607; City/Town <br />&#61607; State abbreviation<br />&#61607; Zip code<br />&#61607; Country (for addresses outside US)<br />o Telephone number (where available)<br />o Email address (where available)<br />&bull; Each parcel will be assigned a persistent unique identifier such that as parcel updates may result in changes to APN (assessor's parcel number)/PIN (property identification number), this persistent unique identifier will allow parcels to be easily tracked over time<br />&bull; Projection (or something that can be directly reprojected into this projection)<br />o NAD_1983_Albers (as defined in ArcMap)<br />o Projection: Albers<br />o False_Easting: 0.0<br />o False_Northing: 0.0<br />o Central_Meridian: -96.0<br />o Standard_Parallel_1: 29.5<br />o Standard_Parallel_2: 45.5<br />o Latitude_Of_Origin: 23.0<br />o Linear Unit: Meter (1.0)<br />o Geographic Coordinate System: GCS_North_American_1983<br />o Angular Unit: Degree (0.0174532925199433)<br />o Prime Meridian: Greenwich (0.0)<br />o Datum: D_North_American_1983<br />o Spheroid: GRS_1980<br />o Semimajor Axis: 6378137.0<br />o Semiminor Axis: 6356752.314140356<br />o Inverse Flattening: 298.257222101<br />&bull; Estimated Parcel Information Delivery Date = September 30, 2017<br />&bull; Estimated Option (Updates/Maintenance) Delivery Date - September 30, 2018</p>
<p>The information extracted will become part of the permanent Forest Service record for the plot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option Period</span></p>
<p>This contract would consist of a Base + 1 Option. The Option would be to acquire updates to the underlying data/annual maintenance plan to access the most up-to-date ownership information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></p>
<p>Procurement of this dataset will allow members of the FIA program to extract ownership and parcel boundary information for each FIA plot falling within the intersecting geographic coverage. Acquisition of information in this manner will significantly reduce the workload on field crew typically responsible for gathering such information, and also enable them to utilize parcel boundary data while in the field.</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause)</p>

<DESC>Solicitation SB1341-76-RQ-0396-1 Dynamic Mode Mixer
<p>Amendment 001: The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions:</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Pertaining to CLN 0005 and 0010, Are these just bare fiber? Patch cords? Can you provide required length and connector type?<br />Answer 1:</p>
<p>This fiber is for evaluation for fabrication of a mode mixer using this core diameter. The length is the length necessary for the vendor to have confidence in their ability to incorporate the fiber into a mode mixer.  <br />Question 2:</p>
<p>Pertaining to CLN 0005 and 0010, InF3 fibers will have to come from 2 different vendors. Unless CLN 0005 and CLN 0010 are fiber options to install in CLN 0003 and CLN 0008 instead of the specified fiber<br />Answer 2:</p>
<p>Yes, it is fine to use InF3 fibers.  From our previous discussions with the vendor, this is the material that was settled upon for the 1900 nm to 3100 nm optical fiber for the Mode Mixer(s).<br />There is no requirement on specific vendor.  It is fine that the material will come from 2 different vendors.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p class="Default" style="text-align: center;" align="center">&nbsp;MAY 3-4, 2017<br />KIRTLAND AIRFORCE BASE<br />ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO</p>
<p class="Default"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Industry Day attendance will be limited.&nbsp; &nbsp;Attendance must be requested by contacting the Contracting Officer as well as Denise McKay </span><a style="background-color: yellow;" href="mailto:denise.mckay.ctr@us.af.mil">denise.mckay.ctr@us.af.mil</a><span style="background-color: yellow;">&nbsp; </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no later than April 24<sup>th</sup>, 2017</span></strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance at Industry Day has the following stipulations:</span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-left: .5in;">A) Attendance at the SSPEDI Industry Day is recommended; however, attendance is neither required nor a prerequisite for proposal/bid submission and will not be considered in the evaluation.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-left: .5in;">B) Offerors, individuals, or interested parties who plan to attend Industry Day must provide the Contracting Officer in writing, at a minimum, full name of the attendee(s), identification of nationality (U.S. or specify other nation citizenship), Lawful Permanent Resident Numbers in the case of foreign nationals, affiliation and full office address, email, and phone number. &nbsp;&nbsp;Except for foreign nationals, the identification information must be provided at least 5 working days in advance of Industry Day. This information shall be provided as soon as possible for foreign nationals due to the longer badging and clearance processing time required. Foreign National access to the base is subject to Federal security procedures/regulations. The Government is not responsible for offerors' inability to obtain clearance within sufficient time to attend the event.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-left: .5in;">C) <strong>Due to space limitations, representation of any potential Offeror may not exceed five (5) company representatives/persons per Offeror.</strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-left: .5in;">D) Any "lobbying firm or lobbyist" as defined in 2 U.S.C. 1602(9) and (10), or any Offeror represented by a lobbyist under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 shall be specifically identified.</p>
<p class="Default">The Agenda is still to be determined.&nbsp; May 3<sup>nd</sup> is tentatively planned to provide an overview of the requirement including an overview of the Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW) facility with tour.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NASA/ORS anticipate use of May 4<sup>th</sup> for brief one-on-one meetings, by request, with interested parties.&nbsp;</span></strong> Note that all dates are subject to change.&nbsp; Interested Parties will be notified of any changes through posted information on this website (FBO). The Government is not responsible for costs associated with participation or attendance at Industry Day.</p>
<p class="Default">As a reminder, this acquisition is not typical in that it represents the solicitation of two requirements: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Space Enablers</span> (SpE) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Space Solutions</span> (SpS).&nbsp; These contracts will serve as follow-ons to contracts awarded in 2009 titled Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW) and Modular Space Vehicles (MSV). &nbsp;&nbsp;As was done for the existing contracts, the Government&rsquo;s intent is to enter into a single award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contractual arrangement for SpE and a multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contractual arrangement for SpS. &nbsp;All IDIQ contracts will have a five-year period of performance. The procurement will be conducted on a full and open basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">Due to the relationship between the two requirements and to avoid Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI), Offerors shall be limited to submitting one proposal for either SpS or SpE.&nbsp; Offerors are not allowed to submit proposals for both efforts.&nbsp; Offerors that submit one proposal that combines the SpE and SpS requirements, or multiple proposals, will not be considered.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) office is hosting an industry day June 26 and June 27, 2017.  It will consist of a 2 &frac12; hour general audience session the morning of June 26, 2017, followed by vendor demonstration sessions in the afternoon for solutions that satisfy the expectations laid out in this announcement.<br /><br />USSM is requesting demonstrations of payroll and/or time and attendance software-as-a-service (SaaS)* solutions that:
<p>1) Are offered by the software publisher who created and owns the source code and intellectual property that constitutes the solution. <br /><br />2) Support multiple tenants within a single instance and scales on-demand to accommodate between 30,0000 and 2.5 million users.<br /><br />3) Allow the customer to pay for service at a rate that is generally steady or decreasing over use. Pricing does not change significantly upward, as scale should reduce per-customer costs.  <br /><br />4) The product does or can meet FedRAMP requirements.<br /><br />5) Automatically pushes upgrades, patches, and security updates to all SaaS customers (e.g., customers cannot elect to stay on an older version of the solution).<br /><br />6) Have mobile-friendly interface options or follow a responsive design methodology.</p>
<p>Due to logistical considerations, the general morning session on June 26, 2017 will be limited to two representatives from each vendor. Attendees must register at the link at the end of this posting.</p>
<p>Vendors who meet the definition of SaaS and are interested in showcasing their payroll and/or time &amp; attendance SaaS solutions during one of the demonstration sessions must also submit the second portion of the form in the link at the end of this posting.</p>
<p>During the demonstration vendors should highlight and emphasize the following:  <br /> <br />- Adaptability and flexibility of the solution to handle unique requirements via configuration (e.g., federal specific requirements such as "budget object class"**) without software customization (i.e., without creating new code/a new instance) <br /><br />--- Vendors may want to provide a list/chart of configurable items and demonstrate the most commonly used configurations<br /><br />- Pricing and contracting strategies to potentially include deployment and transition costs<br /><br />- Current federal regulations/policies that could inhibit the vendor from effectively delivering SaaS to the government<br /><br />- Ability to adapt the solution to changing requirements and continuously provide better customer service and quality through innovation<br /><br />- Previous experience with federal/state/local governments or customers of similar size (e.g., private sector companies)<br /> <br />Video teleconferencing is available for those vendors who would like to showcase their offering, but may not be able to come to the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>Please use the Google form at this link https://goo.gl/forms/hrW8UkVBJAzHqsMl2 to RSVP for the Monday morning industry day session and, if interested, indicate your preferred date and time frame(s) (e.g., Tuesday morning) for the demonstration session by June 1, 2017.  You will receive a confirmation email by Monday, June 5, 2017. USSM reserves the right to assign vendors to any time frame, due to scheduling needs.</p>
<p>Vendors must submit their completed form to USSM by <strong>June 1, 2017 </strong>to participate in either or both portions.&nbsp;<strong>USSM will accept questions on this posting through Tuesday, May 30.  Answers will be posted on an ongoing basis, as they are determined, due to the short response time. </strong></p>
<p>The time slot options for the 50-minute demonstrations are indicated below</p>
<p>Monday, June 26<br />1:00 PM - 1:50 PM<br />2:00 PM - 2:50 PM<br />3:00 PM - 3:50 PM<br />4:00 PM - 4:50 PM</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to construct a new U.S. Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The government will utilize the "Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc)" also known and "Construction Manager at Risk" or "Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP)" as the project delivery method. The CMc contractor shall provide a new courthouse on a government-owned site in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and will be approximately 243,000 gross square feet including 19,350 square feet of interior parking plus associated service and circulation spaces. These construction services shall be performed at a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).
<p><br />The award will be made using FAR part 15. The objective of the Source Selection Process is to select a proposal that represents the best value to the Government. The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and offers the best value to the Government, considering the price and nonprice factors. Competitive proposals shall be evaluated based on the factors specified in the solicitation. For this solicitation, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is significantly more important than price.<br /><br />Below are the technical factors, in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>(1) Management Approach <br />(2) Experience <br />(3) Past Performance <br />(4) Small Business Utilization <br />(5) Project Labor Agreement</p>
<p>Important Notes: (1) In accordance with FAR 28.102-2, both a performance and payment bond will need to be furnished by the successful offeror after award of the contract. Both bonds shall be valued at 100 percent of the contract price. (2) In accordance with FAR 30.201, award may only be made to an offeror that is fully compliant with regard to their Cost Accounting Standards. Therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate their compliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) through the submittal of all disclosures in accordance with FAR 52.230&shy;1, Cost Accounting Standards Notice and Certifications and FAR 52.230&shy;7, Proposal Disclosure &shy; Cost Accounting Practice Changes. Award shall not be made to any contractor that is not CAS compliant.</p>
<p>This procurement will follow the advisory multi-step process in accordance with FAR 15.202.&nbsp;<br /><br />The technical evaluation factors&nbsp;are broken down by phase as follows:</p>
<p>Phase I:</p>
<p>(1) Experience <br />(2) Past Performance</p>
<p>Upon completion of the evaluation of Phase I proposals, an advisory shortlist will be developed. All offerors will be notified as to whether their firm was included on or excluded from the advisory shortlist. It shall be noted that exclusion from the advisory shortlist shall not preclude offerors from submitting a Phase II proposal.</p>
<p>Phase II:</p>
<p>(1) Management Approach <br />(2) Small Business Utilization<br />(3) Project Labor Agreement<br /><br />Offerors shall also be required to submit a price proposal under Phase II. <br /><br />The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $125,000,000.00 and $150,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Award is anticipated to me made for design phase services with an option for early site packages and an option for building construction. Design phase services are anticipated to commence upon award of the contract on or about February 2018. The Option for Site Utilities is anticipated to be awarded on or about March 2018. The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to be awarded on or about January 2019, with a performance period of approximately 1571 calendar days. Offerors shall note that while the total project budget has received Congressional authorization, it has yet to be fully appropriated.</p>
<p>A preproposal conference will be held&nbsp;on June 2, 2017. Please refer to the solicitation for more information. Small businesses are highly encouraged to attend. Prior notification of attendance to this conference is mandatory. Please provide your company name and all potential attendees' full names to Nadya.Popil@gsa.gov.</p>

<DESC>Marysville Ring Levee Phase 2A North
<p>The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) with the intent of awarding a Firm-Fixed Price construction contract for the Marysville Ring Levee (MRL) Phase 2A North Project. <br /><br />This acquisition is being set-aside 100% for small business concerns.</p>
<p>However, please note that the RFP will require the successful prime contractor to self-perform the cut-off wall effort of this project.<br /><br />Project Description: The Marysville Ring Levee (MRL) Project is located in Marysville, California. The purpose of the project is to reduce flood risk to the urban area of Marysville. The Phase 2A North project is situated just north of the 5th Street Bridge abutment. The project consists of strengthen the existing levee system from station 195+40 to 208+60, by means of a seepage cutoff wall under the riverside toe of the levee, and backfilling the excavated levee slope with a portion of the excavated material and imported impervious fill. The cutoff wall is approximately 1200 lineal feet (LF), the depth of the cutoff wall varies from 36 to 38 feet, and a minimum thickness of 30 inches. Additionally, the cutoff wall will tie into an existing cutoff wall near station 195+40.</p>
<p>The cutoff wall will be constructed using the Open Trench method. A portion of the waterside embankment will be removed and replaced with a portion of removed material and impervious imported material, with a final slope of 3:1. The embankment removal will encroach on the levee crown road and the Bituminous Concrete Pavement (BC) and Aggregate Base (AB) will be removed and replaced. An area with stone and concrete rubble on levee embankment will need to be removed as it lies within the cutoff wall alignments. Erosion control measures will need to be applied to all disturbed areas. The contractor will remove and reconstruct approximately 200 feet of the upper portion of the bike trail and safety rail. The project is located adjacent to an active UPRR tracks. Safety precautions will need to be taken and access to the construction site will not require crossing the tracks. Coordination with PG&amp;E will be required to address relocation of overhead utilities before excavation of the embankment and during construction of the cutoff wall. Removal and protection of some trees, branches and bushes may be necessary within the temporary construction easement.</p>
<p>The Government estimates issuing the contract award on or about&nbsp;31&nbsp;August 2017. The period of performance for construction is estimated to be&nbsp;269 calendar days from notice to proceed. <br /><br />In accordance with the DFAR 236.204, the magnitude disclosure of this construction project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This proposed contract action will be conducted using FSC Code: Y1PZ and North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS): 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction and the small business size standard is $36.5 million.</p>
<p>The RFP is estimated to be issued on or about&nbsp;30 May 2017. The RFP will be issued on the Government Point of Entry known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). All plans and technical documents will be uploaded onto FedBizOpps as part of the RFP, available for inspection without charge. The estimated due date for proposals will be on or about&nbsp;&nbsp;July 2017. Once issued, the RFP will identify a firm due date/time for receipt of proposals.<br /><br />The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.</p>

, St. Louis, MO 63122 US
<DESC>The Government of India has entered into FMS case, IN-B-UAK, with the United States to procure 145 M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzers. According to the terms of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) approved 30 November 2016 by the Indian and United States governments, procurement of the FMS requirement must be acquired from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This resulted in a new firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract with the OEM for 145 Optical Fire Control (OFC) Kits and associated spare parts which are an integral part of the M777A2 system. The OEM is Seiler Instrument and Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Seiler). The OFC is an integral component for the operation of the M777A2 that measures azimuth and elevation to aim a howitzer with the utmost of precision in order to accurately hit the intended target. Therefore, the OFC and associated spare parts are considered to be support equipment as specified in the LOA and must be acquired from the OEM, Seiler, using other than competitive procedures.

<AWARDEE>BEACON POINT ASSOCIATES, 1216 SW 4TH ST, CAPE CORAL, FL 33991 US
<DESC>&nbsp; This Order Selection Decision Document covers the acquisition of the Synthes CMF Matrix mandible Implant and Instrument Set (Part Number: 01.503.150; NSN: 6515-01-644-7977) for delivery to the DDHU Stock Maintenance Division, Hill AFB, UT. Delivery lead-time is 14 days. The Requisition number(s) for this action are W25MWY83420042 and W25MWY63630379. In accordance with the guidance as outlined in FAR Part 8 and DFARS 208.405-70, which specifies competition rules for orders valued above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, the above requirement was solicited via an RFQ to all current&nbsp;vendors.<br />The requirement was sent to all known equipment vendors currently holding an ECAT contract and released on the FedBizOps website on May 15, 2017, 2017 with the date and time set for receipt of quotes on May 18, 2017 at 3:00 PM EST.<br />Three quotes were received from responsible vendors. The lowest and most price reasonable quote was received from Beacon Point Associates. It is in the best interest of the Government to award to Beacon Point. <br />The mandibular plating system is a specialized surgical set that is a required and critical component within the Army's Dental Materiel Set Oral: Maxillofacial Surgery unit assemblages. Deployable forces and contingency operations surgeons performing specialized trauma surgery use it. <br />This is a requirement by the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School (USAMEDDC &amp; S), Health Readiness Center of Excellence (HRCoE) and Capabilities Development Integration Directorate (CDID) during scheduled medical set reviews in 2014. It is a required item in all Army Dental Material Sets to support deployed medical Combat Support Hospitals. They are also common sets used for surgical facial reconstruction in both fixed and field hospitals and, for training purposes at the Army's Pre-Deployment Regional Medical Training sites. This buy is a logical needs requirement based on the fielding scheduled for the Army's programmed transition of current Combat Support Hospital configuration to the approved Field Hospital configuration. This transition is scheduled to commence through 2022. The conversation process will affect&nbsp;Active Duty, National Guard and U.S. Reserve modified Table of Organization authorized units.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development, Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance under the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/DCHA/OFDA), intends to extend the Personal Services Contract (PSC) without competition for a period of nine months of the incumbent contractor for the same position of Public Health Advisor. An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when awarded to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays. Continuing performance of the proposed PSC is critical to the mission of USAID and is in the best interest of the United States Government. This notice is published in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 5.203.
