<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to an Aircraft Engine Lift Trailer, a four-wheel mechanical and hydraulic assembly, which is used to support and raise/lower jet aircraft engines for the purpose of installation and removal from Naval and Marine Corps fixed wing aircraft.  This trailer will be used in landbased applications as well as aboard Naval aircraft carriers and shall be capable of lifting 3500 pounds while controlling the load in roll, pitch and yaw.  The trailer shall have four individually controlled parking brakes and four casters for side entry beneath aircraft.  Wheels on the side of the trailer shall provide fore and aft movement and side-to-side movement shall be provided by casters which may be positioned on the bottom of the trailer and used when the wheels are raised.  Vertical lift movement of the trailer shall be accomplished by using manually operated hydraulic lift systems.  In addition to the functions of supporting and raising and lowering engines, the trailer shall have the capability of transporting engines and therefore shall be towable. Approximate ideal envelope dimensions are as follows:  Height (in lowered position without mounting accessories): 25 inches, Width: 63 inches, Length: 150 inches.  
Approximate ideal weight shall be 2600 pounds. Please provide any pamphlets, operating and maintenance manuals, or any other documentation that would describe a unit to meet the above requirements.
