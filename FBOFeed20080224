1.0	INTRODUCTION
This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the purposes of identifying available vendors whose technologies and products address an anticipated operational need for intelligent video-surveillance systems hardware and software.  It is envisioned that such a video system, hereafter referred to as ICCTV, could be part of an integrated approach to enhancing the security of the national transportation system in the United States by means of remote surveillance. Please note that there is no solicitation available at this time, and this RFI does not constitute a future contract. Vendors will not be compensated for providing information. 

The objective of this RFI is to solicit input from industry related to technologies with operational capabilities that enhance and automate or are capable of automating some of the remote surveillance processes and tools available to meet the TSA?s requirements.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks to obtain information about various automated and semi-automated technology that would lead to an easily-integrated "system of systems," applied to and configured for security surveillance and screening activities similar to the mission of TSA. Finding solutions that secure the aviation transportation mission is the primary focus for this RFI in the near term, but the TSA is interested in the eventual application of operationally effective and suitable security screening technologies for other transportation modes as well. Candidate security surveillance and screening technologies, products and/or systems, hereafter called "proposed solutions", may include anything from turn-key implementations, to technology components, to subsystems that may integrate into larger systems.  A discussion of the trade space, including cost-benefit projections and the effects on overall lifecycle cost, is desired and encouraged.

Vendors should refer to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) website at www.dhs.gov and the TSA website at www.tsa.gov for information about the TSA mission, organization, locations, customer services, and current initiatives.

2.0	BACKGROUND
Subsequent to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States Congress mandated electronic screening of checked baggage (Public Law 107-71) and the purchase and utilization of emerging technology equipment; the installation of surveillance systems to monitor checkpoint activities and the modification of checkpoint infrastructure to support checkpoint reconfigurations (Public law 110-207).  In support of these mandates, The Advance Surveillance Program (ASP) within the Office of Security Technology (OST) is creating a stakeholder based, standardized and integrated approach toward video coverage of the security checkpoint and search areas within transportation security screening operating zones, i.e., facilities. 

A primary goal of this program is to define and verify the ability and resources of TSA to provide for an additional level of surveillance that is video based to:
  - Provide an additional layer of security that may be accomplished in both a covert or overt setting. 
  - Facilitate the detection and tracking of possible threats at a remote distance.
  - Identify and attempt to resolve real world problems associated with intelligent video based systems.
  - Create an additional path going forward to provide for the installation of intelligent video based systems within our transportation systems.
 
3.0	RFI RESPONSE OUTLINE
This section provides guidelines for a vendor's white paper response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the papers for ease of analysis and review by the TSA. The page counts provided are guidelines, but not hard requirements on the respondent. While we expected responses to not exceed 20 pages, if the vendor feels more pages are required to provide the requested information, they should be included.

Section 1- Corporate Identification:
Briefly describe the organization, products and services, history, ownership, certifications, and other information deemed applicable to this RFI.

Section 2 - Applicable Technologies and Approach--Solutions:
Identify and discuss system solutions and products, including technologies, services, processes, and capabilities that the company would provide. This should be part of a technological, automated approach to implement and enhance the process of security surveillance. The TSA is interested in non-proprietary systems that can be easily integrated into an overall communications infrastructure. Proprietary elements or other unique aspects of the proposed solution/approach that may be relevant to the integration into the larger TSA security infrastructure must be identified.

The TSA is interested in system solutions and alternatives that align with the vision described earlier.  Additionally, the TSA encourages creativity and cost savings opportunities in response to this RFI.

Section 3 - Experience and Background:
Describe the number of similar technology-related solutions designed and implemented and their deployed locations, methodology for program management, security requirements met (for execution of the effort), best practices, and relevant lessons learned. Indicate General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract number, along with Government Points of Contact (POCs) specific to the task, if applicable.  Indicate the cost, scope, and complexity of the efforts cited.

Of particular interest to the TSA would be a discussion and description of any direct experience with the design, development, and implementation of intelligent video systems or subsystems that are currently operational at a given airport. This discussion should include deployed locations (airports installed), how long the system/subsystem has been operational, and identification of the procuring agency/organization.
 
Section 4 - Alternatives:
Describe one or more high-level alternative operational capabilities based on information provided in this RFI.  Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches in terms of addressing the mission objectives described in this RFI, as well as the effects on overall lifecycle cost and any other system specific operational labor requirements.  Address cost/benefit factors that would be implicit in the approach and/or alternatives being proposed and considered.  Discuss compatibility of the products and capabilities with the future vision of a progressive ingress/egress transition area that will serve to inhibit and prevent unauthorized access to secure/sterile areas of a transportation terminal.

Section 5 - Success Criteria:
Identify candidate performance metrics that could be used by TSA to measure and track the effectiveness of the system in the field.

Section 6 - Risk Factors:
Describe perceived risks in terms of technical performance and possible mitigation strategies for addressing these risks.

4.0	DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued for market research and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  The TSA will not provide results of the evaluation.  Receipt of submission does not constitute an endorsement of the contractor?s equipment or solution by the TSA. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary and will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The TSA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing and publishing this RFI.  

5.0	VENDOR SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES AND CONTACT INFORMATION
Electronic responses to this RFI are required.  Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Word or PDF format (using 12 point Times New Roman) no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on March 14, 2008, to: Connie.Thornton@dhs.gov.
