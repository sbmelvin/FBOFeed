GovWorks intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about April 14, 2004 utilizing a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that will describe the basic, top-level objectives for developing new or revised methods for mitigating declines in an insured's approved yield following successive years of low yield.  This approach will provide potential offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective and innovative solutions that meet RMA's goals and objectives for the program.  The intent of this SOO is to obtain proposals for: (1) research and development of new and innovative approaches to mitigating declines in yield guarantees following successive years of low yield, or provide improvements to existing procedures; and/or (2) research and development of new and innovative procedures for determination of approved APH yields.  In particular, RMA seeks proposals for new or modified approaches to establishing approved APH yields that are: 1) Less subject to decreases during successive years of low yields as compared to current procedures; 2) Equitable across insureds with differing average yields; 3) Broadly applicable to all crops and regions, or 4) Broadly applicable to Category B crops (Annual crops that consist of Barley, Canola (Rapeseed, Beans (Dry, including Contract Seed Beans and Processing), Corn, Cotton, ELS Cotton, Flax, Forage Production, Grain Sorghum, Millet, Oats, Onions, Peanuts, Peas (Dry and Green), Potatoes, Popcorn, Rice, Rye, Safflower, Soybeans, Sugar Beets, Sugarcane, Sunflower Seed, Processing Sweet Corn, Tobacco (Production Guarantee - types 41 and 32 PA; 51 and 61 CT; 51, 52, and 61 MA; and 32 MD), Tomatoes (Processing and Fresh Market Guaranteed Production) and Wheat), or 5) Broadly applicable to Category C crops (Perennial Crops that consist of Almonds, Apples, Arizona-California Citrus, Blueberries, Cranberries, Figs, Grapes, Macadamia Nuts, Peaches, Pears, Plums, Prunes, Stonefruit (Apricots, Nectarines and Peaches), Table Grapes, Texas Citrus Fruit and Walnuts), or 6) Address specific producers, crops and/or regions.  7) Not susceptible to moral hazard, fraud, waste and abuse; 8) Affordable to insureds; 9) Feasible and cost-effective for RMA and reinsured companies to administer;  10) Understandable to insureds, agents, and other program participants, and; 11) Actuarially sound. Multiple proposals may be submitted and evaluated, and more than one award may be made.  RMA anticipates committing substantial monetary resources towards funding proposals.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 20, 2004.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative research and development projects to advance the capabilities of Counterterrorism and Forensic Science.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-958557.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set?aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102 (d) (2) (i).

<DESC>The Fleet established a requirement for full configuration P-3C Aircraft Improvement Program (AIP) mission readiness trainers in FY 02.  The four existing 2F179 AIP Tactical Aircrew Coordination Trainers (TACT) lack acoustic sensor operator stations and require upgraded capability at other aircrew stations to achieve a full mission readiness level trainer.  Also, fatigue life expended (FLE) issues have dictated that AIP readiness training be shifted into trainers to conserve P-3 airframe life.  The AIP readiness trainer requirement is supported by N789 in the APN7 budget and FAST Plan for FY 04 - 06.  
The redesignated 2F179A Tactical Operational Readiness Trainer (TORT) will provide full aircrew coordination training and readiness certification training for P-3C AIP aircrews.  The 2F179A TORT will be an across-the-board upgrade of the current 2F179 TACT.  A stand-alone prototype 2F179A TORT will be delivered to NAS Jacksonville.  Subsequently, the four existing 2F179 TACT trainers will be upgraded to the new 2F179A TORT configuration.   The result will be five 2F179A TORT trainers. 
The trainers are located in NAS Jacksonville, NAS Brunswick, NAS Whidbey Island, and NAS Kaneohe Bay.
The 2F179A TORT prototype and four 2F179 TACT to 2F179A TORT upgrades will be acquired through open competition under Lot I of the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) contract.  A delivery order will be awarded under the TSC II ID/IQC on a Best Value, trade-off analysis acquisition approach.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR SUBCONTRACTING INFORMATION ONLY.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport - US Navy currently has a portable acoustic range offshore of Little Stirrup Cay (Coco Cay) in the Bahamas.  Utilization of this range requires that a support ship be moored in a 4-point moor, and connected via a cable to a range of underwater sensors, Portable Tracking System (PTS).  In an effort to reduce the operational cost of this asset by eliminating the need for a support ship, the Navy requires the installation of an interface between the “shore end” of the acoustic range sensors and a shore location on Little Stirrup Cay.  This interface will be comprised of an optical-electrical-mechanical (OEM) cable and junction boxes.  The OEM cable and in-water junction will provide a permanent shore connection for the PTS.  The government has previously obtained all the permits and necessary environmental regulations to proceed forward with the installation.  There shall be no requirements for the contractor to obtain permits to install the cable. Work shall be performed on and offshore of Little Stirrup Cay, Bahamas and Portsmouth, Virginia.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion type contract is anticipated. Award will be based on the Best Value to the Government. Offers will be evaluated on two evaluation factors, TECHNICAL CAPABILITY (subfactors: Technical Approach, Past Performance) and COST.  The period of performance is 180 calendar days from the date of award.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the government. Telephone requests will not be honored. NAICS:  541330.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) hereby notifies their intent to award a lease to FAE Enterprises, Inc., 645 Summer Street, Boston, MA 02130, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

To facilitate accommodating the returning of the Jacqueline B. Kennedy dress collection from the Paris, France tour, to expeditiously move the other Kennedy collections from the construction room sites, and to share in the overall cost of an offsite storage of the NARA JFK materials, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation entered into a storage lease agreement with FAE for November, 2003 to October, 2004.  It is the agency’s intent to remain in the current space with this follow on lease. Occupancy is required by October 1, 2004. 

The lease services include the current existing built out of 10,000 square feet of alarmed, climate controlled, private storage space in accordance with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards. These include 36CFR1228 subpart K, NARA 1571, and the Architectural and Design Standards for Presidential Libraries.  Because of security response time from the agency security guards, the facility must be within 20 minutes, or 10 miles from the current library at Columbia Point. The term of the new lease is to be a base year with nine option years (10 years total).

The estimated lease cost range is $200,000 to $250,000 per annum.  

The agency will consider other responsible requests for SFO, if received no later than 15 days from the date of this notice, to the National Archives and Records Administration, Space and Security Management Division, Real Property Management Branch (NASR), Room 1150, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740, ATTN: Ronald C.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI4052 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-19.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisition procedures with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md. for clinical specimens.  The Hopkins School of Medicine has had longstanding access to patients with sexuazlly-transmitted diseases and has provided diagnostic testing services using advanced molecular probes for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomonas and HIV for the Institute for the past eighteen (18) years.  Dr. Charlotte Gaydos oversees the highly specialized training of technicians and performance of these tests that are used throughout the Johns Hopkins University, and the laboratory is approved by the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment.  For the good of the government, the vendor should not be changed now because many of the patients who have provided clinical specimens to this laboratory for past and current studies will be followed in the future; to change patient populations now would make such prospective follow-up impossible and seriously limit the number and kinds of scientific discoveries that can be derived from this data.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Baltimore, MD.  This is a fixed-price contract and the FOB terms are “Destination.”  The anticipated period of performance will be 04/15/04 – 09/30/04.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  FAR 52.225-3.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.  Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) is required.  [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award] Registration is available via the Internet at www.CCR.gov <http://www.CCR.gov>. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Tuesday, April 20, 2004.  For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE70, Room/70D, MSC/4812, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to Guy Baratte at (301) 594-3419.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>The project is located at the Lower Willow Creek Reservoir approximately 20 miles southwest of Drummond, Montana, and 8 miles west of Hall, Montana.  This project consists of placing a two-line grout curtain in a portion of the foundation on the Lower Willow Creek Dam in order to reduce seepage.  The curtains shall extend for approximately 200 feet along the dam and include a fan of holes from vertical to 45 degrees into the hillside on the left abutment.  Holes in the dam are to be drilled and cased in order to permit grouting the foundation.  The dam height varies from 0 feet to approximately 90 feet at this location.  The depth of the curtain will be determined based on grout takes and permeability testing, however, it is anticipated this depth will be approximately 40 feet below the bottom of the core trench.  Estimated quantities based on drilling and grouting to these depths are as follows:  Drilling Embankment and Overburden – 3,260 LF; Drilling Foundation – 2,811 LF; and Placing Grout – 4,200 CF.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source contract, under FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source, to the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) for support for the National Facility Identification System Enhancement.  This proposed contract will be a follow-on effort to NAPA grant number X-83077101-0 which recently expired.  The effort under the grant addressed details necessary for integrating facility identification data into a comprehensive system of environmental information that would serve the needs of non-government entities. EPA collects facility information through the authorities provided in various regulations and statutes.  Currently, the Facility Registry System (FRS) master files are created in EPA's Office of Environmental Information (OEI) and reviewed and enhanced by a Regional Data Steward network.  These records are based on information from EPA's national program systems and state master facility records and are enhanced by other web information resources. Under this proposed contract, OEI will obtain an evaluation of the existing facility identification system from the perspective of potential non-government users.  NAPA shall prepare recommendations for enhancements to the system, as appropriate, to make it a more effective electronic tool for use by non-government entities. NAPA shall provide for four tasks: 1) work plan development and progress reporting, 2) research and information collection to describe the need for facility identification information by non-government stakeholders, the extent to which EPA's existing FRS meets or does not meet those needs, the types of enhancements to EPA's existing system that would address the unmet information needs of non-governmental entities, and technological requirements of those enhancements, 3) analysis of all information collected and the results of all research conducted under task 2 and develop a set of options for enhancements to EPA's existing facility identification system, and 4) final report summarizing the work conducted , presenting the options considered, the results of the evaluation of options and conclusions and recommendations. Questions concerning this proposed contract, or for copies of the statement of work,  should be addressed in writing to Barbara Hammond, Contracting Officer, sent via e-mail to hammond.barbara@epa.gov or to David Fuller at fuller.david@epa.gov.

Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or to any other contract. However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 3.205-18. F. PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. Proposals will be evaluated by a peer or scientific review process using the following evaluation criteria in descending order of importance: Factor 1: Technical quality and scientific merit of the proposed technical approach and program plan, and the relevance of the proposed technology to future AFRL/DE programs; Factor 2: Capabilities and related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives; and Factor 3: Affordability. No further evaluation factors will be used in selecting proposals. The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal, both technical and cost to determine the overall merit of the proposals. The technical aspect is ranked as the first order of priority and is significantly more important than cost, however, cost/price is a substantial consideration in selection of proposals for award. AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. When requested, a debriefing will be provided IAW FAR 15.505 and 15.506. G. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: While the Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed, a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee, Level of Effort, IDIQ Completion and/or Level of Effort contract(s) of 60 months duration is anticipated. Should any award result in an IDIQ contract, the maximum ordering amount is only an estimate and is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. The following deliverable types of data may be required subject to change upon contract negotiation: (a) Program Plan with updates as needed; (b) Monthly Status/Financial Reports; (c) Final Report, draft and final; and (d) Presentation Material as needed in conjunction with technical interchange meetings. It is anticipated that contractors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) may submit proposals. Contact the Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) on-line at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp or at DLIS, US/Canada Joint Certification Center, Federal Center, 74 North Washington, Battle Creek, Michigan 49016-4312, 1-800-352-3572 for further information on the certification and approval process. Foreign-owned firms that are interested must contact the Contracting POC, Barbara Steinbock at 505-846-2246 prior to proposal submission.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Coherent Laser Group, of Santa Clara, California, for acquisition of one (1) Base Upgrade Kit Femto to Dual.  The Upgrade Laser System will be used by the NIST Polymers Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.***Sole source determination is based on the need to covert an existing Mira-F (Femto) to a Mira-P (Pico).  The upgraded laser system is part of a Coherent anti-Strokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) microscope, which is to be used for in-situ, non-invasive studies of cell growth and tissue generation in tissue scaffolds for regenerative medicine.  NIST specifications is that the Mira Oscillator be modified so that:  1) It can produce laser pulses in either of the ranges 90 to 200 fs, or 1to 3 ps with minimal effort in changing from one range to another.  One half to one days work is acceptable for the change from femto to pico, or vice versa; 2) There is no loss of output power due to modifications performed on the laser; and 3) There is no additional chirp imparted to the femtosecond pulses due to modifications to the laser.  Coherent Laser Group is the only known source that can provide this upgrade with all required specifications.***Delivery is required within 60 days or less after receipt of order (ARO) and shall be made FOB destination.***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.***No solicitation package will be issued.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. *****

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT- The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to negotiate a contract on a sole-source basic with Axciton Systems Incorporation for Polygraph Equipment (Axciton 5 Channel) and support.

Axciton polygraph system is required to ensure compatibility with previous completed work. Award to any other source is anticipated to result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement. Authority for this sole source procurement is 10 USC 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1. Firms that recognize that they can perform the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer, and provide supporting evidence to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis. The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on any information provided is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sourced will be given full consideration. Only written responses will be considered. See Note(s): 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Information on the above listed technologies will be provided to the interested  offeror upon request.  All proposals should be received by the date and time  stated above.                          STATEMENT OF WORK           HE 441D RS and AT4CS RS Engineering Analysis 1.0	SCOPE  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for an engineering study  to explore IM solutions to the HE 441D RS and AT4CS RS which would render them  IM compliant. The contractor shall provide the necessary materials, services,  personnel, equipment and data in accordance with the requirements of this  Statement of Work. 2.0	BACKGROUND The HE 441D RS is a member of the MAAWS M3 family of ammunitions. The MAAWS M3  is utilized by the United States Special Forces as one of the primary weapons  in both training and combat scenarios.   The AT4CS RS is a stand-alone, single  shot, pre loaded, shoulder fired weapon.  The HE 441D RS and the AT4CS RS are  not fully IM compliant, both failed to achieve minimum threshold requirements  during previously conducted IM testing.   3.0	APPROACH The approach to be utilized will be that of an engineering study.  The study  will include analysis and limited tests (as required) to determine feasibility  of numerous approaches. At the culmination of the 441D RS analysis it is  desired that flying debris, from the test article, be restricted to 50 feet of  the testing item.  For the AT4CS RS it is desired to defeat the S&A device in  the case of an inadvertent launch (threshold) with the objective being  preventing the projectile from launching.   4.0	WORK REQUIREMENTS 4.1	Support Integrated Product Team (IPT) Meetings and IM Test activities  during execution of the contract. 4.2	Focus engineering studies, analysis and testing (as required) towards  the following goals:   •	HE 441D RS: 	Prevent fragments (cartridge case and fuze assembly) from traveling         in excess of 50 feet.  Currently these items travel in excess of 90          feet during fast and slow cook off testing.   •	AT4CS RS         Prevent launch of the munition (objective) during fast cook off, slow          cook off, and bullet impact.  If this is not achievable, the threshold          requirement is to render the S&A inoperable in IM environments.   •	The engineering studies, analysis and testing should address numerous  design or packaging solutions.  They should include but are not limited to: 	AT4CS RS packaging: PA171 type steel can with pressure vents. 	HE 441D RS packaging:  PA157 type steel can. 	HE 441D RS packaging:  Steel mesh liner. 	AT4CS RS S&A device:  Mechanical pin to block connection of detonator. 	AT4CS RS S&A device:  Thermo explosive pellet to lock S&A or pre-fire          detonator in safe position.   5.3 Period of Performance – The period of performance of this effort shall not        exceed six months. 5.4	Deliverable Reports 	Monthly Progress Report (DI-MGMT-80227). As part of the first monthly          report, an overall program schedule shall be included detailing the          planned effort and projected test events. 	At the culmination of this exercise a detailed engineering trade study          report depicting IM solutions that could be adapted to the AT4CS RS and          441D RS shall be required.

<CONTACT>Contract Buyer is Brandy Epperson,937-255-2619 ext. 3004
<DESC>Sources are sought for an effort to verify improved durability to the Pratt + Whitney F100 engine exhaust  nozzle divergent seals utilizing advanced high temperature  Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC).   The United States Air Force operates F-15 and F-16 fighter  aircraft powered by the F100 turbine engine.  This turbine  engine has an axisymmetric translating nozzle with an aft  divergent section.  This nozzle currently utilizes 15  metallic divergent seals that have a high field replacement  rate.  This requires frequent inspections and the universal  availability of spares in the field for sustained mission  readiness.  Advanced technologies are being sought to  increase engine exhaust nozzle life and reliability for  improved warfighter readiness.   Contractors must possess the technical ability to perform  an advanced component verification task.  This task shall  include F100-229 exhaust nozzle divergent seal fabrication,  assembly, flight-testing, performance parameter  verification, data analysis, and reporting.   Given the limited life of current metallic divergent seals,  only experienced contractors utilizing advanced high  temperature Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) will be  considered.  F100-229 divergent seals, spares, and metallic attachment  hardware that may be fastened directly to the CMC will be  contractor provided.  It is anticipated the F100-229 engine  and test aircraft will be government furnished. Sources shall ensure any proposed solution will result in  turbine engine exhaust nozzle technologies capable of  meeting full life.  The full life requirement is 4300 Total  Accumulated Cycles (TAC) for the F100-229 exhaust nozzle  divergent seals.   Potential sources will need to have verified a minimum of  90% full life through actual F100-229 ground engine  experience.   A successful ground test is defined as completing the  ground testing with no through-thickness cracks in the test  articles, and no delaminations greater than 9 square inches  and contained to only the surface ply for the test  articles.  The estimated award date is Dec 2004.  This date is subject  to change.  The period of performance is anticipated to be  24 months for the technical effort plus 4 months to prepare  the Final Report. Routine communications concerning this synopsis should be  directed to Brandy Epperson, Contract Negotiator, at (937)  255-7243, ext. 3004 or Jackie Owens, Contracting Officer,  at (937) 255-7243, ext. 3001.

3)	Is the planned start date an evaluation factor?

A.	The actual planned start date will not be an evaluation factor if the proposal can meet the not to exceed threshold listed in the solicitation.

4)	Can millings be reincorporated?

A.	No.

5)	Is there a stockpile of crushed concrete currently on base?  Is it going to balance out?  Can we use that stockpile?  How much is left?

A.	Yes. Calculations show the project will use less crushed concrete for base material than will be produced through demolition. The existing stockpile is usable, but not a sufficient quantity to complete the project without crushing material generated by this job.

6)	Who will supply the radios that Airfield Management requires for the contractor
to be in contact with the tower during operational hours?  The contractor or the government?

A.	Government.

7)	Is the 40V gate or another gate available to use?  Will privately owned vehicles (POVs) be allowed through that gate or only marked construction vehicles?

A.	A single construction gate will be available and staffed as needed by Security Forces.  All construction traffic for this project will be routed through the construction gate.  Gates will allow direct access to either State Highway 51 (Bruneau Highway) or State Highway 67 (Grandview Highway). Following award, contractor will choose the preferred gate, which will be coordinated with Security Forces for use. 


8)	How will the flow of traffic work at the 40V gate if it is utilized?  That is a one way flow on private property; will there be a two-way flow?

A.	Intent is for one-way loop traffic flow. This has yet to be finalized.


9)	Is the end date defined?

A.	Yes, it will be defined in the solicitation.


10)	In the overruns, is the asphalt milled up to existing base gravel underneath?

A.	Yes.


11)	In the overruns, is it an option to move the thresholds up?

A.	No.


12)	On the taxiways, does the milling and replacement go all the way to the runway?

A.	Yes, and the 200’ clearance line is distinctly marked.


13)	The foreign object debris (FOD) ridden concrete on H will be taken out.  Will it be hauled and crushed?

A.	Yes.

14)	On the portions of the project that require slab jacking, what will be done with the tie down anchors? 

A.	Design Engineer is evaluating and solution will be included with the solicitation.

15)	There are some roads that were utilized previously to access the overruns; will they be available for use on this project?

A.	Yes.



This project repairs existing taxiways and overruns through various methods to include urethane injection slab jacking, mill and overlay of asphalt surfaces, and full-depth concrete replacement.  A relatively small amount of electrical work is also included to install new edge lighting on one connecting taxiway.  Concrete and asphalt products must meet strict guidelines as described in project specifications to include aggregate quality, mix design, quality control testing, batching tolerances, as-placed testing, and final performance.  The approximate breakout of pavement repair methods are 520,000 square feet of asphalt mill and overlay, 150,000 square feet of full depth concrete replacement, and 16,250 square feet of slab jacking. 

The Magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

This contract will be a FFP contract with a NTE 120 days.
The successful contractor will be selected based upon several evaluation factors to include: past performance, mission capability, and cost/price.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest proposed price.  Offerors shall submit proposals that can be accepted solely on the basis of the initial offer as the Government may proceed with award of contract without discussion.  

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 31 Mar 04 using the Government's Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps).  Paper copies are not available.  You must register on the subject site in order to receive notification of changes to the solicitation; however, you may still retrieve the changes without registering.  Note: Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) in order to be eligible for award.  Registration requires a DUNS number.  Registration may take up to three weeks to process.  Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION TO THE INITIAL SYNOPSIS IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED:  

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price contract to ORBCOMM to obtain Contractor technical and Management support services to develop the capability to receive, process and forward the Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal via spacecraft and their associated ground systems. The USCG requires this capability within the next two years. Under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), ORBCOMM is considered to be the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

This requirement includes, but is not limited to, the following: (1) Design payload add-on to receive and process the AIS signal (162 MHz (VHF); (2) Build the payload; (3) Mate the payload to an existing satellite scheduled to be launched within the next year and a half; (4) Launch the satellite; (5) Check-out the AIS payload; (6) Provide AIS reporting from that system to a USCG Command center; (7)Design payload AIS portion of ORBCOMM replenishment satellites to be launched in 2006; and (8) Design modifications to ORBCOMM ground system to allow forwarding of collected AIS signals to Coast Guard Command Center.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add an eighth topic to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for High Altitude Airship technologies, including platforms designs, subsystems, components and payloads. The BAA description is revised to read as follows:  

The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, MDA has established a Deputy for Advanced Systems (AS) whose mission is to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  MDA/AS has established an Innovation Cell, which consists of a team of experts to evaluate new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The MDA/AS Innovation Cell seeks new and innovative concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following eight technology areas: (1) Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Hardware (transmit/receive modules), Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; (2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems, including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control, Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Focal Plane Arrays, Lethality Mechanisms; (3) Mathematics and Computer Science, including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Probability and Statistics, and Pattern Recognition; (4) Electrical Engineering, including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5) Physics and Chemistry, including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, including Space Systems, Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, and Materials Science; (7) Battle Management/Command and Control, including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification, Identification, and Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion; and (8) High Altitude Airship, including platform designs, subsystems, components, and payloads.  

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (requested limit of five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offeror’s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors, which have been certified as a Small Business Concern, should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below.  

MDA will evaluate these responses based upon the following criteria (all criteria of equal importance): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include the maturity of the technology and the level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offer’s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that a BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016).  White Papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until September 30, 2003. Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FYs 2002 – 2004, and will most likely be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type of arrangement.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Richard Baumgartner at (703) 695-9086 or email at Richard.Baumgartner@mda.osd.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the solicitation requirements.  The Civilian Personnel Management Service has a requirement to provide an executive development course to DLAMP participants as the final element prior to program completion.  CPMS has selected the Brookings Institution course, “Executive Leadership in a Changing Environment:  A Program for SES Managers and SES Candidates,” to meet this requirement.  The period of performance is 15 Apr 04 through 14 Jan 05 with three one year options.  The requirement for this effort is to provide training to approximately 500 DLAMP participants within 6-9 months of contract award.  The annual requirement for the next three option years is approximately 200 participants.  Class size is normally 25 students.  The course must complement and build upon the leadership competencies developed through other program elements.  These include the two-week leadership course provided to DLAMP participants upon admission to the program, instruction in leadership provided through Professional Military Education (War Colleges), and business/management skills acquired through the graduate education requirements of the program.  The final leadership course must meet the following requirements:  Be available as a standard offering of the provider (“off-the-shelf”), in order to eliminate separate development and revision costs and minimize lead-time to begin training.  Focus on leadership in the public sector, with emphasis on the roles, challenges, ethical considerations, and democratic processes unique to Federal service, in order to foster and renew a strong commitment to public service.  Focus directly on the Office of Personnel Management Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs), with primary emphasis on:  Leading Change, Leading People, and Building Coalitions/Communication.  Emphasize the leadership competencies underlying the ECQs at the executive level:  Influencing/Negotiating, Strategic Thinking, Political Savvy, and External Awareness.  Include an assessment of and feedback on the student’s executive qualifications.  Include both experiential and academic styles of learning.  Accomplish objectives through approximately one week of instruction.  The current requirement is for 500 class seats, to be scheduled over a period of approximately six to nine months.  The contract should provide for three option years, each with a requirement for approximately 200 class seats.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available electronically on 5 April 2004 by written request to brenda.geist@dla.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reinstate what was originally Amendment 0001 regarding restrictive competition.  Due to a computer error, the Amendment  was overrode by the Amendment to change the response date of the solicitation. The original amendment is reinstated as Amendment 0003 as follows: In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, competition for this procurement is restricted to the United States and Canada. Because of the Government's extensive prior development efforts in the field of high energy pulsed power supply technology, the Government has decided to  release a Pulsed Power Supply (PPS) Technology Summary, to interested offerors, as soon as this solicitation is released.  Due to the restriction on  competition for this effort and the fact that Electromagnetic Gun (EM) technology has been identified as a developing military critical technology, all contractors that desire the Government's information package are required  to submit an approved DD Form 2345, "Military Critical Technical Data Agreement" with their request for this information.  After receipt of the DD Form 2345, a nondisclosure agreement will be sent to the contractor for signature.  This may be signed and faced to the Government.  Upon receipt, the Government will  mail a copy of the PPS information.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Sophia Hurt, Contract Specialist, Ph:(202) 273-5739, Fx:(202) 273-7448
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking information from firms who can provide management, administrative services, and support functions for planning and executing the 2006 National Veterans Wheelchair Games (NVWG) to be held in Anchorage, Alaska during July 2006.  The fundamental purpose of the games is to provide physically disabled veterans with an introductory experience in a variety of wheelchair sports and to expose them to the myriad of organized wheelchair sports and recreation activities available nationwide. The NVWG, the nation’s largest annual wheelchair sporting event, will be planned and executed by a Board of Directors composed of local and national VA officials as well as representatives from the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA).  The board will advise and set general guidelines in which the successful contractor will operate in accomplishing the requirements of a local organizing committee (LOC), as noted in the NVWG Management Manual.  Requirements include such services as arranging meals, transportation, awards distribution, as well as development and coordination of committee structures to support the Games.  Fund raising to assist in offsetting costs of the games and volunteer recruitment are inherent functions of this support contract.  A designated government representative will provide daily oversight of performance related to the developed timeline for tasks. The Government shall not be responsible for costs incurred in the preparation and/or submission of the templates, comments, or information.  If your organization can provide the services sought by VA, please forward a statement of capabilities or marketing literature to Sophia Hurt (049A3C) at the above address or by e-mail.  Facsimile transmissions will not be accepted.  If you require additional assistance to provide the information sought, please call the Contracting Officer (202) 273-5739.  All responses must be received by 12 noon on April 16, 2004.

2. ISSUANCE DATE:  April 2, 2004
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: April 23, 2004
4. POSITION TITLE: Senior Economic Growth Advisor – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 87,439.00 - $ 113,674.00 per annum (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: June   2004 –   June  2006
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Basic Function of the position: 

The 1980s marked a watershed in recent Kosovo history.  During the 80s and early 90s, Serbia, the dominating “partner” in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, systematically began to exclude ethnic Albanians from positions of employment in the public and private sectors in the province of Kosovo as well as from access to services once available to them.  This systematic exclusionary policy, in Kosovo often referred to as apartheid, led to conflict between the Albanian population in Kosovo and the Serbian administrators and police.  The heavy-handed and eventually bloody attempts of the Serbs to put down the Albanian Kosovar rebellion ultimately led to the bombing campaign of NATO in 1999 that caused the withdrawal of Serbian authority and the establishment of UN administration (through UNMIK) over the province.

Support for the development of economic growth (EG) is a key element of accomplishing USAID’s strategic objectives in Kosovo.  USAID’s new five-year strategic plan for Kosovo includes two EG strategic objectives (SOs): SO 1.2, Improved policy and institutional climate for productive investment and SO 1.3, Accelerated private sector growth.    
USAID assistance in support of these SOs includes a contract with BearingPoint focused on the policy and institutional climate for productive investment (SO 1.2).  The areas supported by this contract are budget and tax, financial regulatory system (the Banking and Payments Authority of Kosovo), the commercial legal environment and privatization.  Support in each area includes institutional strengthening and public education.  The contract also provides support for increased integration into regional trade. Activities under SO 1.3, Accelerated growth of the private sector, are currently being developed and will focus on competitiveness and import substitution via increased competitiveness of the agricultural sector, improved capacity of private enterprises and an improved business operating environment.  The EG Office also supports SO4.1, Social stabilization achieved through special initiatives, through assistance to improve the commercial viability of the Kosovo Energy Company.  
In the area of local governance USAID plans to fund a new initiative to strengthen local governance, improve municipal leadership, increase transparency and accountability at the local level, and assist municipal governments to promote local economic development.  This initiative will be managed in the Democracy Governance Office, but will require input and technical advice from the EG Office.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis for FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541512 with a size standard of $21M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide the services described below.  The FDA anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract with a 15-month period of performance and a start date of no later than 09/01/2004. The major objectives to be accomplished under this contract are: 1) to determine system requirements; 2) to design the target architecture and 3) to support implementation contract procurement for the receipt and processing of PDUFA related regulatory application submissions through the use of a single point of entry.  In addition, the target architecture must provide for an extensible and scalable design such that additional non-PDUFA needs can be readily accommodated.  

In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) required that FDA move towards the goal of a paperless submission and review environment.  The regulatory reform initiatives in FDAMA and Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA II) mandated that CBER & CDER have the capability to receive all PDUFA-related regulatory submissions electronically by the year 2002.   More recently, PDUFA III has established the following goals in relation to Electronic Applications and Submissions (Section XII):

·	FDA will implement a common solution in CBER, CDER, ORA and OC for the secure exchange of content including secure e-mail, electronic signatures, and secure submission of, and access to application components.
·	FDA will deliver a single point of entry for the receipt and processing of all electronic submissions in a highly secure environment. This will support CBER, CDER, OC and ORA. The system should automate the current electronic submission processes such as checking the content of electronic submissions for completeness and electronically acknowledging submissions.
·	FDA will provide a specification format for the electronic submission of the Common Technical Document (eCTD), and provide an electronic review system for this new format that will be used by CBER, CDER and ORA reviewers. Implementation should include training to ensure successful deployment. This project will serve as the foundation for automation of other types of electronic submissions. The review software will be made available to the public.
·	Where common business needs exist, CBER, CDER, ORA and OC will use the same software applications, such as eCTD software, and COTS solutions.

FDA receives electronic submissions including IND, BLA, NDA, and IDE regulatory applications as well as their associated correspondence and other types of submissions defined by business units.  While many of these are received online, this project will support a unified FDA business solution.

With the increasing number of electronic submissions and the initial release of the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD), it is critical to automate and standardize the receipt and processing of these submissions.  The objective of the E-Submissions Gateway is to enable the receipt of guidance-compliant electronic submissions over the Internet and to integrate the processing of these submissions with the CBER and CDER environments (as well as extending to other FDA Center/Office needs).  This will enable the FDA to address (if not meet) the PDUFA III Electronic Applications and Submissions Goals of:

·	A single point of entry for the receipt and processing of all electronic submissions in a highly secure environment,
·	Automating the current electronic processes such as checking the content of the electronic submission for completeness and electronically acknowledging submissions,
·	Supporting the electronic submission of the eCTD.

The electronic submission process is defined as the receipt, acknowledgment (to the applicant/sponsor), routing, and notification (to a receiving Center) of the receipt of an electronic submission.

·	“Receipt” means transfer of a submission from a transaction partner’s system to temporary storage in the FDA Gateway.
·	“Acknowledgment” to the sender which includes a detailed submission log confirming what was sent from a transaction partner’s system and received by the Gateway.
·	“Routing” refers to delivering a submission (and corresponding log files) to a Center-level storage area and initiating a manual or automated load process (if established) to place a submission into a Center receiving system (e.g. CBER EDR, CDER EDR).
·	“Notification” of a submission’s arrival is made to those responsible for the Center receiving system.

These steps comprise the whole scope of electronic submission delivery.

Part of this task is the replacement of the current Gateway functionality.  The Gateway currently routes Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) to the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) in CDER and CBER for processing. 

The other element of this task is the integration of the receipt, acknowledgment, routing and notification procedures that need to be incorporated to fully automate the electronic submission process. The solution will have an impact on the current electronic submission receipt and processing.

A Word file will be posted to this website with graphics that show a high-level “Concept of Operations” indicating how the FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway provides support to internal and external stakeholders, and another that details the conceptual structure of the Gateway itself.
Potential contractors need to demonstrate the following capabilities to meet the requirements of the FDA's Electronic Submissions Gateway project.  The contractor should describe the adherence to system development life-cycle best practices and their ability to meet the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 2 requirements.  Describe your understanding of the FDA electronic submission models and guidance, and expertise with needed software tools.  The contractor should provide information on past and present performance in areas of systems life cycle development and technical integration for corporate/enterprise level systems and programs in a government environment.  The contractor should also describe their capabilities in complying with the government's security certification and accreditation requirements.

The contractor should describe their ability to meet the following high-level goals that have been considered in the Gateway architectural design:
·	Enable transaction partners to submit guidance-compliant regulatory submissions (e.g. eCTD, Adverse Event Reports, eBLA and eIND) electronically to the FDA.
·	Expedite the submission of electronic submissions from transaction partners to the FDA using the Internet.
·	Provide a secure central point of receipt of electronic submissions for the Agency and the ability to route submissions to Center level holding areas in an automated fashion.
·	Support standards developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)
·	Provide seamless support for FDA electronic submission business processes.
·	Ensure confidentiality and integrity of e-submissions.
·	Enable audit trail capability and the generation of transmission logs for Agency – Industry transactions.
·	Provide a reliable e-submissions environment (e.g. available 99.5% 24x7x365).
·	Provide a scalable and high performance environment.
·	Support continuity of operations.
·	Maximize the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components.
·	Be based upon open standards.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages, in Microsoft Word, no later than April 20, 2004 to the Contract Specialist via email at kminker@oc.fda.gov

<ARCHDATE>05182004
<CONTACT>Anthony Cicala, Contracting Officer, Phone (571)218-4639, Fax (XXX)XXX-XXX, Email acicala@darpa.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested sources by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) regarding improved high explosives and improved methods to direct high explosive blasts against armored/hardened targets.  

DARPA does not intend to award any type of award instrument based on responses to this RFI, or otherwise provide compensation for the information solicited.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI is provided voluntarily.

This RFI is open to any capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to universities, private or public companies, Government Laboratories, Government research establishments, and Government munitions plants.  

DARPA may issue a formal Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) during the final quarter of Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2004, but nothing herein obligates DARPA to do so.  DARPA may invite responders to present their solutions prior to the release of any anticipated BAA to discuss expediting these technologies, as may be applicable. 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:

As the U.S. military moves toward an increasingly expeditionary force, the recognized need exists to provide lighter weapons with greater lethality, thus allowing easily deployed light forces to be as lethal as heavier forces.  This RFI seeks to gain information to allow DARPA to develop a program to pursue these types of weapon improvements; specifically, general-purpose explosives and methods to attack hardened or armored targets (e.g., tanks and bunkers).  Responses should focus on one or both of the following topical areas: 

High Explosives -  DARPA seeks to gain information about improved conventional high explosives, volumetric explosives (a.k.a. thermobaric explosives), and novel explosive techniques.  The latter includes, but is not limited to, using micrometer and nanometer sized particles to replace or supplement conventional high explosives.  The goal is to develop explosives that are several times more powerful per unit weight than TNT in the open air, with both better blast effects and improved metal breaking abilities.  Considerations for this topical area will focus on the effectiveness of innovative high explosives compared to those of currently available high explosives.

Improved Energy Transfer from High Explosives to Hardened Targets -  Current techniques to attack hardened targets include the shaped charge, platter charge, and self-forming projectiles.  Currently available technologies transfer less than 15% of the explosive?s released energy to the target.  DARPA seeks information regarding techniques to increase the amount of energy transferred to the target to substantially greater proportions.  Considerations for this topical area will focus on the innovative technologies ability to penetrate varying thicknesses of reinforced concrete, armored steel, and composite armors.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS:

Responders should provide a high-level description of their solution or technology that will fulfill the objectives for this program.  Responders should identify their technical objective and unique development qualifications pursuant to the accomplishment of these objectives.

Responses should be no more than five pages in length (ten pages if both topical areas are addressed).  Reponses should be marked with appropriate proprietary markings, such as "Company Proprietary."  Markings like "Company Confidential" or other phrases that may be confused with national security classifications shall be avoided.  An additional, non-proprietary page should identify the responders technical and administrative points of contact, to include name, address, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses.

The Government anticipates that responses to this RFI will be unclassified.  In the event that an RFI response may be classified, contact DARPA/ATO at (703)526-4777 for full instructions on how to prepare and submit your response.

Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format via email to Colonel Tim Gibson, DARPA Program Manager, at explosivesRFI@darpa.mil.  Responses that cannot be submitted electronically may be delivered to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington VA 22203-1714, Attn: Colonel Tom Gibson, ATO.  Responses are due no later than 4:00pm, Arlington, VA Local Time, 3 May 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is conduction a Market Survey to identify potential sources to provide a technology working group that provides objective perspective and develops technology positions  related to railgun launcher weaponization as part of a Government and Contractor Integrated Project Team (IPT) working on the Electromagnetic (EM) Gun Technology Maturation and Demonstration Program. The purposes of the group are to evaluate launcher issues facing the IPT and develop a set of technical positions that promote standardization of language and process within the EM railgun launcher field.  The group will consider all the technologies necessary for the development of robust railgun launcher subsystem of an EM Weapon, but will place particular focus upon issues relevant to determination and extension of railgun safe service life and launcher weaponization.  It is not the intent of the group to investigate issues  primarily related to other EM weapon subsystems, including the power supply  and launch package (i.e., the bullet).  The group is anticipated to convene for approximately ten two-day meetings at various locations throughout the U.S. over a two-year period.  A secret level security clearance is desirable. We are seeking sources for two levels of participation: First, organizations interested to oversee and manage the working group must submit clear and concise information that will show a superior understanding of technology management and information dissemination in armament engineering, and EM propulsion.  Prior experience in leading working groups on technology challenges that were subsequently surmounted, resulting in type classification of improved weapon systems in highly desirable.  This can be demonstrated in  the form of publications, existing databases, related experience in working group oversight, documents resulting from prior working groups, and prior contracts successfully completed. Second, individuals and/or organizations interested in participating on the working group must submit clear and concise information detailing their experience, expertise, and recognition of professional stature suitable to demonstrate their credibility to the IPT as well as the extended EM launcher community, if selected to participate in the working group.  This can be demonstrated in the form of a two-page resume, publications, patents, professional recognition, and related experience contributing to other  successful working groups. This information is to be provided via e-mail to ksage@pica.army.mil or pnickel@pica.army.mil, and received by 16 April 2004.  Brochures may be mailed to U.S. Army TACOM ARDEC, AMSTA-AQ-APE, B.10, ATTN:  Kathy Sage,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000.  This market survey is for information  and planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal,  and the Government will not reimburse the costs incurred by providing this information.  See Numbered Note 25.

<SUBJECT>A -- Low-Noise Niobium Nitride (NbN) Hot Electron Bolometer ( HEB) System Integration
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire research support for a study on “Low Noise NbN Hot Electron Bolometer (NbN HEB) System Integration” from the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. A. Background: The Terahertz Technology Project in NIST's Electromagnetics Division submitted a proposal entitled, "Development of Low-Noise NbN Hot Electron Bolometer (HEB) THz Receiver Technology for Temperatures above 10 K"" in response to NASA Research Announcement NRA 00-OSS-01 of the Space Astrophysics Research and Analysis program. The proposal outlined a plan of research on the performance of extremely thin films of Niobium Nitride (NbN), as heterodyne detector elements in ultra-low noise, terahertz-frequency spectrometers. Such spectrometers are used in many NASA missions to obtain data on the chemical composition and physical properties of the Earth's atmosphere, the atmospheres of other planets, and interstellar nebulae. After a competitive evaluation of the proposal described above, NASA transferred funds to NIST to support this joint institutional study.  The three institutions involved in the proposal were NIST, the University of Massachusetts and the University of Colorado.  This contract  to the University of Colorado is to support the final phase of the team proposal. B. SCOPE:  The University of Colorado will integrate niobium nitride hot-electron-bolometers with the LO laser source and a cryocooler for demonstration of technology compatibility. The core of this research will be measurements of receiver noise temperature of NbN HEB in ambient temperature of available state-of-the-art cryocooler using a FIR laser as the LO source. C. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract period consists of a 10-month period of performance from 6/1/2004 through 3/30/2005.  D. SOLE SOURCE:  NIST has determined that only the University of Colorado can perform the research described in the statement of work due to the following: I.  Their capability to handle the exceptionally demanding integration of systems, based on NbN hot electorn bolometric mixers used for astronomy or remote sensing of the atmosphere and II.. Their unique testing facilities.   I.  The group of Dr. Albert Betz at CU has extensive experience in developing and deploying such systems.  The unusual properties that make integration very challenging include: (a) Cryogenic testing: The bolometers are to operate at temperatures between 4 and 10 K (degrees above absolute zero). The test facilities therefore must provide capability to cool a sample, along with cold electronics, to temperatures in this range. Understanding the temperature dependence of the bolometer properties is critical, and near the upper end of the range, the temperature dependence can be quite strong. Therefore the test facility must be able to hold the sample at any fixed temperature within the 4-10 K operating range, to within 0.01 K. This type of cryogenic capability is typically found at research labs rather commercial electronics test services. Commercial microwave electronics suppliers typically do not test their products at cryogenic temperatures. The CU group's facilities have all necessary cryogenic capabilities, which has been verified by their research publications, and by on-site visits of NIST personnel.   (b) Ultra-low microwave noise: The most important bolometer property to be tested is noise, under both DC-biased conditions and DC-biased plus terahertz driven conditions. In order to obtain meaningful results the intrinsic noise of the test facility must be low enough to avoid dominating the measurement. Typically, a noise temperature of 5 K or below, at 1 GHz, is required. This requires the use of cryogenic microwave electronics, closely integrated with the sample and cooled to the 10-15 K range. The construction and operation of such cryogenic, low-noise electronics is a highly specialized capability. The capability has been developed only at a few institutions, e.g. the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Charlottesville, VA, and a few universities. The CU group's facilities have all necessary low-noise microwave capabilities, which has been verified by their research publications, and by on-site visits of NIST personnel. (c) Terahertz LO source drive capability: The NASA contract requires measurements of bolometer noise under "pumped" conditions, i.e. when driven with a terahertz-frequency source, as would be the case in a heterodyne receiver. This obviously requires that the contractor have available a terahertz frequency source. The frequency range required for this contract is approximately 1- 5 THz, with at least 10 specific frequencies in this range needed, at power levels above 1 mW. This can only be provided by complex and expensive (over $ 200,000) molecular gas laser systems, which few laboratories possess. In fact, there are only two other institutions with molecular gas lasers of the required stability (see 2a (iii) below): Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lucent Technologies. Both have made strategic decisions not to pursue work on NbN mixers because they are pursuing other technologies instead (Nb diffusion cooled mixers and GaAs 2D electron gas mixers, respectively.) This is known from direct discussions with, or professional presentations given by, the JPL and Lucent personnel involved. The CU group has flown such mobile terahertz LO source laser on an airborne platform and has additional sources in their laboratory.   (d)  Expertise and prior experience: It must be emphasized that the devices which require testing are experimental. Their testing absolutely requires the ability to analyze unique engineering problems arising out of the unusual cryogenic, low-noise, and high frequency properties of the devices. The only convincing way to demonstrate this ability to solve such engineering problems is through the publication of research papers describing their solution. The CU group has an enormous experience in developing detector-based systems at terahertz frequencies for astronomy and remote sensing as is evident by their long list of publications.  II.   The testing facilities at CU have been developed over a decade, and were specifically designed for the testing of terahertz receivers. Heterodyne receiver test capabilities at other institutions, e.g. JPL, Yale. Univ., NRAO, Harvard Center for Astrophysics (CFA), were all developed for testing of other types of detector at different frequency ranges, and would require significant modification for use with NbN HEB's at frequencies above 1.5 THz.  The specific technical capabilities not available from any other source include: i. Testing capability over the continuous temperature range from 4- 10 K, with 0.01 K stability and accuracy.  ii.  Instrumental microwave noise below 5 K at 1 GHz, and capability to measure microwave noise with comparable instrumental noise levels over the range 0.5 - 5 GHz.   iii. Ability to quasi-optically drive the sample with range 0.5 - 5 GHz.   iii. Ability to quasi-optically drive the sample with range 0.5 - 5 GHz. iii.  Ability to quasi-optically drive the sample with terahertz-frequency radiation, with at least 10 separate frequencies spanning the 1- 5 THz range, at power levels greater than  mW, with power stability better than 1 % over an hour.  Each of the capabilities described above in (a) through (c) is available at a small number of research institutions in the U.S. but none of the other institutions possess all of the capabilities or has the unique testing facilities described above except CU.  In addition, CU has adapted their test capabilities to the particular requirements of NbN mixer testing.    This notice may represent the only notice.  See note 22.

<SUBJECT>Request For Developer Applications For an Enhanced Use Leasing Initiative
<DESC>Request For Developer Applications            For an Enhanced Use Leasing Initiative at Picatinny, New Jersey InSitech is a non-profit new Jersey based corporation selected by the US Army Armaments Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal New Jersey to perform various partnership intermediary services IAW 15 USC  3715.  In pursuing these services, InSitech will coordinate the interests of  State economic development authorities, local municipalities, corporations  and industries that are specific to the technological development of Picatinny Arsenal. One of the services InSitech is planning to perform for Picatinny is to  facilitate a comprehensive Enhanced Use Leasing Initiative at the Picatinny  military installation.  The Army proposes to lease to InSitech, who will  sublease by one or more leases at fair market value, 120 acres and 100K sq. ft. of non-excess facility space for commercial use as laboratories, educational/ training, light manufacturing, and administrative facilities.  It is envisioned that the leased real property assets will be developed/renovated to support a  Hi-Tech/University Park that will house businesses and educational facilities  that are consistent with and complement the mission of Picatinny. In support of this effort, InSitech is seeking requests for applications from developers (or development teams) interested in the planning, design and  development of the 120 acres and 100K sq. ft. of existing non-excess space at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. InSitech will competitively select a developer/development team in accordance with the selection criteria contained in the request for developer  applications.  Upon the Army's approval of the selected developer, InSitech  will be awarded a Conditional Notice of Lease Award.  At this time, InSitech  and the selected developer will collaboratively work with the Army to develop a Business and Lease Plan for the proposed site development.  Upon completion of the Plan and final approval by the Army, a lease or leases will be  negotiated and executed to implement the Plan or portions thereof.  In no  event will InSitech, the Army or Picatinny be responsible for the payment of any fees or have any liability to the developer for the plan or work product generated in developing the Plan. The goal of this leasing and site development initiative is to facilitate the most effective and efficient utilization of Picatinny's real property assets and capture that value to enhance Picatinny's mission capability.  The  proposed site development, if implemented, will facilitate the transfer of technology between the military and commercial sectors, enhance the mission capabilities of Picatinny Arsenal, and encourage the further development of  new technological research capabilities through the collaboration of academia, government, and the private sector.  The Technology park development would also promote and provide a solid foundation for the economic growth of Morris County and the State of New Jersey. The valuable real and intellectual property asssets at the Picatinny  installation, coupled with the local progressive-minded business community, make this initiative a ready made opportunity for a developer to lead the way in national military base re-invention. A Request for Developer Applications for this action will be available for  viewing and response starting April 2, 2004 on InSitech's website at  www.InSitech.org. April 23rd, 2004 is the closing date for submission of the Request for Developer Applications.  Completed responses to the request (six copies) must be received Not Later Than (NLT) 3:00pm EST.  Application packages should be mailed to:  InSitech Incorporated, c/o Mr. Carmine Spinelli, P.O. Box 382 Wharton, New Jersey  07885. FAXED and e-mailed application packages will not be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a neutron detector. This detector is for a high-altitude balloon borne instrument that measures the flux and energy of neutrons in the energy range from thermal ( 1 eV) to energies of 500 MeV from an exposure platform provided by the DSTB facility. The instrument must operate in the high altitude balloon environment at &gt;120,000 ft. It must derive its power and communicate with the DSTB facility. The instrument must measure data on long duration balloon flights. The instrument must be calibrated. The instrument will become property of NASA. Services to be provided include those necessary to design, fabricate, test, calibrate and document the final instrument. Technical support is to be provided to demonstrate the operation of the instrument, provide scientific evaluation of its performance, and integrate the instrument on to the DSTB platform or suitable GSE setup. The instrument is based on the designs and development of the instrument from Richard Maurer at APL (ref.1). The required completion date is May 2005 with an estimated lead-time for fabrication of 12 months and 3 months to complete the calibration and integration on to the DSTB.  Deliverables under this procurement included: 1)	   Instrument Design  2)   Instrument Hardware including detector and support electronics and operational software 3)      Demonstration and verification of the scientific performance of the instrument at delivery to NSSTC 4)  Support integration onto the DSTB including mechanical, power and communication bus 5)  Shielding design specifications   6)    Data analysis from laboratory testing and calibrations and results of instrument performance including energy response, charged particle rejection efficiency, and neutron detection efficiency.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item from the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at John Hopkins University in Laurel, Maryland pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The APL at John Hopkins University has the necessary scientific and technical experience conducting scientific investigations with the neutron measurements to assure the instruments delivered to NASA will operate in the specialized environment of high altitude balloon flights and perform to levels suitable for scientific research.  They have conducted scientific measurements for NASA on high altitude balloon flights previously and performed measurements at particle accelerators. The measurements technique and instruments development required in this procurement were previously developed and tested under a NRA award.  There is no single source with the demonstrated experience to meet all measurement requirements under this procurement action including:  identifying the necessary adaptations to the current instrument design for the prescribed environment, fully characterized the instruments using a neutron source, performing a calibration of the instrument components and performing the data analysis to document the performance. The proposed instrumentation design, fabrication, evaluation, calibration and integration must be completed prior to May 2005 to meet the schedule for the DSTB Facility.  There is insufficient time to complete the contents of this procurement in a piecemeal fashion using multiple sources and facilities.  A delivery later than May 2005 will adversely impact the DSTB schedule that must meet a launch window of opportunity in Antarctica during the local summertime when balloon flight operations are conducted. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing (e-mail is preferred belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov) not later than April 23, 2004. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. CST on April 30, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad Program of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is tasked with integrating and modernizing the Marine Infantry Rifle Squad. Currently there are multiple Program Managers that conduct R&D, procure equipment, and provide Life Cycle and safety support for infantry equipment used by the Marine Infantry Rifle Squad.  Since most of these items are individually procured under specific requirements, integration elements for the Marine Infantryman’s ensemble of equipment are not normally considered. Integrating combat equipment, while simultaneously accommodating human factors concerns, is a complicated effort requiring unique skills and experience. The objective of this initiative is to design more ergonomic equipment loads, thereby increasing the warfighting capability of individual Marines. 

Tasks:

CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL BACKGROUND CHECK  - The SEC shall conduct a thorough check including a background investigation for each prospective contractor employee under this Contract who will have access to SEC buildings or non-public information in order to determine suitability for work under this Contract based on the sensitivity of the information that the prospective Contract employee will access while performing the job. For each prospective Contractor employee, the Contractor shall complete OPM Form 85P and submit it to the COTR. OPM Form 85P is available at http://www.opm.gov/forms. For questions concerning this requirement, contact the Office of Human Resources and Administrative Services (OHRAS) at 202-942-4000. The Government reserves the right of final approval for prospective Contract employees. CONTENT OF THE CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL BACKGROUND CHECK - The contractor personnel background check shall include, but not be limited to the following: 1. CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECK - The SEC will contact local jurisdictions including the Virginia State Police, Maryland State Police, and the Washington Metropolitan Police Department to determine the criminal history of each prospective Contract employee. For prospective Contract employees who have resided in local jurisdictions for less than six months, the SEC will pursue criminal history checks from the city or county of the prospective Contract employee’s most recent residency. The SEC will also obtain a national criminal history report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 2. CREDIT HISTORY CHECK The SEC will seek evidence that the prospective Contract employee is responsible with credit obligations. A prospective Contract employee who receives an unfavorable credit rating shall be approved by the OAPM Security Specialist before acceptance under this Contract. The prospective Contract employee shall address the circumstances surrounding the unfavorable credit rating in writing and shall submit the explanation to the OHRAS Security Specialist through the COTR or other designated official for approval before assignment under this Contract. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability (i.e., ability to interface, integrate and export to other standard software packages that the SEC currently owns), (2) User and Administration training, (3) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (4) price. If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). This evaluation shall be based on information provided by the contractor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item FAR clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (OCT 2000); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions; therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive. However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency). FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (FEB 2002); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (APR 2003) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-41, 52.222-43, 52.222-44, 52.232-33, 52.232-36, 52.239-1. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) also applies.

(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.
