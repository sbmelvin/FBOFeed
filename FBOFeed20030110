<DESC>The FAA currently employs an audio path for air/ground (A/G) communications between control sites and remote A/G radio transmitter/receiver sites. Air traffic controllers use this audio path for communications with aircraft under their control. <P> Pursuant to AMS policy 3.2.1.2.1, the FAA is notifying the public that it is our intent to extend the period of performance under General Dynamics Decision Systems contract DTFA01-97-D-03005 for an additional three (3) years under the authority of the AMS, Section 3.2.2.4.1, Single Source Selection Procurement Process, subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, Non-emergencies. However, if after reading the technical and programmatic requirements listed below, interested parties who have the requisite capabilities to fulfill this requirement are invited to submit a letter of interest and capability statement describing the equipment and wherewithal to maintain all fielded FAA RCE equipment to rita.mcnair@faa.gov no later than 3:00 p.m. EST January 17,2003. The contract period of performance will be from April 1, 2003, through March 31, 2006. The estimated cost of the contract exceeds $100,000. <P> Currently, the FAA has fielded approximately 17,500 units of RCE throughout the National Airspace System (NAS).  The FAA is looking for similar equipment to provide voice and control signals between switches at the control facilities and radios at the remote facilities.  The total requirement over a 3-year period is estimated to be an additional 400 to 700 units (half control unit and half remote units).  The requirement will support the Communications Facility Enhancement (CFE), Back Up Emergency Communications (BUEC) and Radio Control Equipment (RCE) Programs and requirements from the Terminal Business Unit (TBU). <P> This product needs to be capable of interfacing to all the FAA switch types without any modifications to the existing interfaces, and capable of interfacing to the FAA radios at the remote sites without any modifications. <P> The vendor’s RCE needs to be capable of providing voice and control signals using one telecommunication path.  At a minimum, it should be able to provide the following: <P> - Audio path both in transmit and receive direction. - Support two separate frequencies. - Cold (manual switching) and hot backup (automatic switching without any loss of the air traffic controller’s message) communication between the control and remote sites. - Push-to-Talk (PTT) signaling. - Squelch break and AGC signals. - Muting audio both at the remote and the control sites. - Adjustable attenuation of audio with adjustable timing at the remote sites for the purpose of alleviating the receiver’s pop back. - Main/Standby (M/S) signaling to switch between main and standby radios. - Primary/Back-up operation (one control site controlling one remote site). - Dual control operation (two separated control sites capable of controlling/sharing one remote site). - Separated Transmitter and Receiver operation (One control site controlling two separated remote sites). - Dual Channel enclosure (one RCE unit carrying two RCE cards and functioning as two separate RCEs). - Remote Main! tenance Monitoring (RMM). - DB-9 connector in the front and back panel of the equipment to interface with the FAA MDTs and the Centralized Maintenance System (CMS). - Compatible with the current FAA RCE MDT software. - Compatible with the current FAA RCE CMS operation (control and monitoring). <P> The vendor is required to provide Technical Services, Training, Logistical Support and a 10-year warranty to support their equipment. The vendor is also required to provide Technical Services, Training and Logistical Support to sustain the currently fielded RCEs. In addition, the contractor will also be responsible for Engineering and Technical Support services to include, but not limited to, the following for all fielded RCE units: <P> Configuration Control Configuration Status Accounting Status Reports, Monthly Exchange and Repair (E&R) line replacement unit (LRU) Reports Technical Instruction Books (TIBs) Modifications LRU Repair Failure Reporting <P>

Tradeoff Process:  It may be in the Government's best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror. This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal if the perceived benefits of the highest priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.;

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.  

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

	Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary.

(a)	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term o f the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.	Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 27, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Compilation and data analysis services for gas-phase, capillary-column retention index reference data for use with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Library are sought for the Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD) of the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory.   The NIST Mass Spectral Data Center of the PCPD has built of Retention Index Collection (RIC) for use with the NIST Mass Spectral Library to increase the confidence in the identification of chemical substances represented in the Library.  The RIC now contains approximately 70,000 data values of 20,000 compounds measured on commonly available, non-polar capillary columns. Most of this data originated from papers appearing in the chemical literature.  This contract is intended to assist in the enhancement of this collection in the following ways:  1) keep the collection up to date by identifying and abstracting recently published papers containing relevant retention data;  2) convert reported relative retention data presently in the NIST collection to retention indices by selecting reference values present in, or estimated from values in the collection; 3) verifying the quality of any mass spectral data associated with retention data in the original publications; and 4) examine the reliability of both literature values that have been identified as suspect using NIST data analysis software as well as estimated values for important compounds in the Mass Spectral Library whose retention indices have not been measured.  Each year, approximately 300 papers containing gas phase retention data acquired on commonly available columns appear in the literature.  A more thorough description of the requirement will be in the Statement of Work in the solicitation.  This requirement requires a thorough, molecular level understanding of the factors determining the magnitude of gas-phase retention indices in order to find and fix data problems.  The analysis of data will require the use of existing knowledge concerning trends of known retention indices for related homologous series as well as retention indices for structurally similar compounds.  It also requires the assessment of whether observed differences in retention indices are reliable for different conditions and compounds.   In addition, it will also require an understanding of fragmentation mechanisms of mass spectrometry as well as the combined use of retention indices and mass spectral patterns to identify chemical substances.  The period of performance is a base year and 2 option years. An award will be made using FAR Part 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The solicitation, SB1341-03-R-0007 will be issued on or around January 31, 2003. The competitive solicitations, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   All responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute (NCI) is interested in expanding their existing pool of Master Agreement holders for ?Record Linkage Studies Utilizing Resources in Population-Based Tumor Registries?.  The NCI desires to contract with population-based tumor registries in order to collaborate in the conduct of record-linkage and subsequent analytical investigations.  The main tasks in support of the record-linkage studies include: developing a study plan; developing or applying appropriate record-linkage procedures to link a population file with the cancer registry files; evaluating results from the record-linkage study; providing results of the record-linkage study to the NCI in the form of a computer file with appropriate documentation of record format and variables used; developing record-keeping procedures to maintain filing systems of all relevant material; and monitoring performance and providing written technical and financial reports as required under a subsequent Master Agreement Order.  Optional capabilities include providing biologic specimens and providing access to other existing computerized registries that have been or could be linked to the cancer registry.  Offerors will be evaluated on their qualification as a population-based cancer registry including their knowledge of the population at risk; ability to provide completeness of ascertainment of incident cancer cases in the population; validity of classification and coding of all cancer cases; procedures used for case follow-up; ability to provide five-year cancer incidence data; ability to maintain data in a secure environment; and qualifications and experience of the registry and personnel.  In addition, offerors will be evaluated on their technical response to a sample master agreement order on a hypothetical record-linkage study.  

The Master Agreement contract mechanism is a pre-qualification to enable qualified sources to compete for and perform future contracts, which will be awarded based on Request for Proposals (RFPs).  Master Agreements (MA) will be awarded to all offerors whose technical proposal is determined to be acceptable.  The initial Master Agreement award is non-monetary and is exclusively for the purpose of establishing a pool of contractors who are qualified to perform services for epidemiologic studies of cancer using the resources of population-based tumor registries.  The obligation of funds shall be accomplished solely through the award of a contract.  Each MA holder will be eligible to compete for future contract awards for record-linkage studies.  Each MA holder who is also determined to be qualified to provide the optional biospecimen component and/or the ability to link other population-based registries to their cancer registry will be eligible to compete for those types of orders as well.  Current MA holders who are currently not eligible to compete for the biospecimen component or ability to link to other population-based registries component, may submit additional clarifying information which will be reviewed to determine technical acceptability for those options.  MA holders who choose to compete for future Master Agreement Orders will be selected based on technical merit, budgetary considerations and other factors.  All responsible sources meeting these criteria are encouraged to submit a proposal and will be considered by the NCI.  All proposals should reference N01-CP-01003-13.

It is anticipated that the solicitation package will be available electronically on or about January 29, 2003.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/, then Click on ?Current Requests for Proposals? and scroll down to ?Master Agreement Announcements? to locate this solicitation. Proposals will be due by March 20, 2003.  Any MA awarded as a result of this solicitation will be in effect from the effective date to July 30, 2005. (This solicitation will be open for the duration of the existing MA pool (through July 30, 2005) with due dates for receipt of proposals annually, March 20 (or the next business day) of each year.  ALL MASTER AGREEMENT HOLDERS ALREADY IN THE EXISTING MASTER AGREEMENT POOL NEED NOT RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact: Kim L. Hall, Contract Specialist; Email address: kh175r@nih.gov ; Fax: (301) 480-0241.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Ref No. 011703, C-Architect and Engineering Services, 
Multi-Discipline, Open-End Contract

1.  Question:  The RFP limits the number of pages for the SF254 to 15.  Is this number per SF254 or the total of all SF254's submitted?  In the past for Eglin solicitations we have submitted a SF254 for us as prime and for all of the consultants (subcontractors) who will be on our team.  

Answer:  15 pages per SF 254.

2.  Question:  I was wondering if the 15 page limit for the 255 was for the entire document, including project references and resumes (Blocks 7 and 8) or just the Block 10.  Would you please clarify?

Answer:  The limit of 15 pages is for the entire SF 255.

3.  Question:  In the past one SF255 has been submitted for the entire team.  Please confirm that this is the requirement for this submittal and that Engineering/Contracting are not requiring a SF255 for each team member.

Answer:  One SF255 per team.

4.  Question:  The synopsis is clear for number of pages - 15 for 254 and 15 for 255 (total for both forms would be 30 pgs).  My question is that since this is an indefinite quantity contract, do 254's and 255's for subcontractors have to be submitted now, or only the 254 and 255 for the firm who will be the prime?  Since it is indefinite quantity for 5 years, other subs may be used and by submitting now, submitting for subs will limit the use of subs that may come up in the next 5 years.

Answer:  We need these for each sub.

<DESC>The following are questions and answers received regarding this RFP. No extension to the closing date results from this additional information.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWER FOR
SP0600-03-R-0306

1.	Annual volume.  Is the requirement for 40,000 liters the first year and 20,000 liters the second year?  Or are there two requirements each year (one for 40,000 and one for 20,000 liters) in both years?

A.	As specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, the requirement is for 40,000 liters the first year and 20,000 liters the second year.

2.	Onsite storage.  The solicitation appears to reference an onsite storage system that the bulk liquid helium is filled into.  How large is that system?  Is it one tank or multiple tanks?  How often do the tanks need to be refilled?
A.	Container capacity is 9,841 liters.  There is only one container at launch complex 40 that will need to be refilled between 2-5 times a year.


3.	Gaseous Helium ? There is a specification for gaseous helium and a statement saying there is both a gaseous and liquid helium requirement, but no volume attached to it?  Is gaseous helium actually required?
A.	No.  This requirement is for bulk liquid helium only (As stated in combined synopsis/solicitation).  The Performance Specification was written to cover the specifications for the different types of helium, which are gaseous and liquid, and is not intended to be used to determine quantitative requirements.  



The Government reserves the right to make awards without negotiations.  Therefore, offerors are advised to submit their best prices with their initial offers.

This action will be for construction phase se rvices through the completion of construction.  Services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of co st to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement. Having worked on this project for 6 years, HKS/WS is the only design firm with the level of knowledge of the projec t design criteria, analysis, calculations and assumptions required to meet the requirements of the Government for the project specific expertise. Maintaining continuity of A/E services utilizing HKS/WS is essential to the satisfactory completion of the pro ject and is in the Government’s overall best interest.

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoD?s new ?system of systems? environment.  As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes.  Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process.  Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter?or a similar forcing function construct?to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing.  Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of ?key performance parameters? throughout the acquisition process.  

NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above.   NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract.  The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period.  Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.

The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes,  incorporation of human performance factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process.  The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers.  This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes.  It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education.  It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. 

The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. The Contractor must have been actively involved in that deliberative process to ensure a seamless transition to emerging acquisition and development initiatives. The Contractor must additionally have experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents.  Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers and job-aids for enhancing their usefulness.  In addition to the above the contractor must have knowledge of and experience in documenting process and products related to the following:

1)	Researching emerging training technology
2)	Applying innovative processes for evaluating these technologies for applicability for implementation across the Joint Services
3)	Synthesizing these processes into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements is essential. 
4)	Datamining
5)	Section 505 Compliance
6)	Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness
7)	Weapons Systems and Training Systems Acquisition
8)	Systems Engineering
9)	Human Systems Integration
10)	Human Systems Engineering
11)	IMI/ADL SCORM production process
12)	Human Performance Analysis
13)	Training Requirements Front End Analysis
14)	Cost-benefit Analysis

Personnel qualifications - the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resulting solicitation for the requirement.

<DESC>The Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), is in the process of standardizing general cleaning materials used aboard U.S. Navy ships. Presently, ships carry a large variety of routine maintenance and shipboard sanitation.  These products can vary in both cleaning efficiency and the degree of safety and health precautions necessary for their use. The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the safety and health aspects (i.e., reduce personal protective equipment requirements (PPE)), and environmental friendliness of the cleaning products that the Navy uses afloat without compromising the mission.  A secondary goal is to reduce the proliferation of numerous authorized cleaning agents listed on the Ship's Hazardous Materials List (SHML).  NSWCCD-SSES is currently in the process of drafting Technical Purchase Desc riptions (TPDs) for deodorizers, oven cleaners, dishwashing detergents, silverware pre-soak, dishwasher descaling compounds, and dishwashing rinse additives. These six TPDs describing the requirements for the listed cleaning applications are posted on our website http://www.dt.navy.mil/acquisition (see link below).      NSWCCD-SSES is soliciting participation from private industry to review and comment on the attached draft TPDs for the above-mentioned applications over a 30-day period ending 14 February 2003.  Based on these responses, TPDs will be revised to reflect applicable industry comments. NSWCCD-SSES is also interested in determining what products are presently commercially available that qualify to these TPD requirements.  All interested vendors may forward comments and product information for cleaning agents that qualify to the performance requirements of the TPDs  to Ms. Christine Socha (215) 897-7499 or Ms. Sarah Phillips (215)897-7401, fax (215) 897-1664.

<DESC>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a requirement for technical services, to be performed in Washington, DC, to support the HUD Integrated Financial Management Improvement Project (HIFMIP).  The HIFMIP initiative is in the planning stage and has requirements to refresh the CFO Vision for HUD financial management systems and to perform cost-benefit, feasibility, and risk analyses to culminate in a solution for the future direction of HIFMIP.

In a February 27, 2002 audit report of HUD's Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2001 and 2000, the HUD Office of the Inspector General recommended that the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) initiate and complete independent and unbiased feasibility and cost-benefit studies for a HUD integrated financial management project.  The feasibility and cost-benefit analyses should include alternatives to upgrade the current legacy system, utilize an application host, use a cross-servicing strategy, or acquire a new JFMIP-certified COTS solution.  OCFO contractor support services will include: update of the HUD Financial Management Vision in an effort to verify the current flow of financial events, financial systems, and external information flows; identification of systems challenges and proposed remedies; and the provision of recommendations for development of an integrated HUD financial management system solution.  Knowledge and learning from the Vision will provide a framework for additional contract support services to conduct feasibility, cost-benefit, and risk analyses that will determine a new financial management systems approach for HUD.  The contractor support services require knowledge of the federally-mandated JFMIP requirements and use of the Automated Standard Application for Payments System (ASAP) or the Payment Management System (PMS) for grant payments, consideration of the Government-wide accounting initiative from Treasury Financial management Systems (FMS), and OMB's proposed Electronic Commerce Portal for interagency receivables and payables.  

It is anticipated that the performance period will be 18 months.  The Vision work would be done as the base performance with 2 follow-on options.  Option 1 is to perform the HUD Systems Development Methodology Initiate Stage work consisting of the Cost/Benefit Analysis, Risk Analysis, Feasibility Study, and System Decision Paper.  Option 2 is to develop a project plan based on the selected HIFMIP solution.

HUD intends to procure the services using the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  HUD intends to solicit only small businesses if sufficient qualified small businesses, or small business-led teams, can participate.  If the competition is opened up to large businesses, interested large businesses will need to express intent to subcontract at least 40% of the work to small businesses.  For purposes of determining size status, NAICS code 541519, with $21M in average annual receipts, will be used.  Interested parties must notify the Contract Specialist and provide the requisite information via email at the following address: charles_g._callaghan@hud.gov. If you have difficulty submitting an email reply, then please call Mr. Callaghan at (303) 672-5281, x 1823.

With the email notification of interest, parties shall provide 1) their qualifications sufficient to ascertain the vendor may be able to perform the requirements stated above, including knowledge of the noted systems, 2) identification as to whether the vendor is large or small and, if large, intent to subcontract 40% or more, and 3) the vendor's GSA schedule number.  Interested parties must respond no later than 4:00 pm Mountain Time, January 31, 2003.  Vendors who do not provide the mandatory information will not be considered.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis for Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Support Pallet 
311 HSW/YASK 
7980 Lindbergh Landing
Brooks AFB, TX 78235-5119
Technical Contact Point: Major Brian Collins, (210) 536-6296; Contracting Officer: Mr. William Keihl, (210) 536-6318
Sources Sought Announcement:  Information regarding qualified sources is being sought for aeromedical evacuation Patient Support Pallets (PSP) in support of the Air Mobility Command's requirement to provide aeromedical evacuation.  This synopsis is also a request for expression of interest and capability information.  Interested parties are requested to submit a copy of information outlining their abilities to support the effort described below.  As a minimum, submission should disclose (1) identification of company size (e.g., # of personnel, if 8A or small Business, etc.), (2) facilities, (3) testing capabilities, (4) technical capabilities, (5) personnel and management capabilities, and (6) estimated delivery date.

Imminent retirement of the C-141 and aging of the C-9 aircraft has led to the requirement for an aeromedical evacuation system based on aircraft pallets which could be used to convert cargo aircraft for opportune patient airlift.  This system would provide AMC and the overseas commands a flexible, modular capability to rapidly reconfigure airlift aircraft, to include the KC-135, KC-10, and C-17, for use in transporting various numbers and combinations of patients in order to carry out the AE mission.  

Without receiving acceptable capability information that addresses the requested specific technical and quality background requirements/experience, it is the Air Force's intent to only solicit ARINC Engineering Services, LLC since any delay in the delivery of the functional PSP units would be unacceptable.  ARINC has completed the design and testing of a functional unit and is in the process of completing the production of the first 25 PSPs to be delivered in the near future to the Government.  This announcement is based on the best information available and may be subject to future changes.  A description of the anticipated effort is outlined in the remainder of this announcement.

The objective of this effort is to procure from 25 to 50 Patient Support Pallets.  This is an attempt to identify both commercially available and modified commercially available systems that provide aeromedical evacuation capability in the footprint of a 463L pallet, using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to the extent possible.  The primary system is the Patient Support Pallet (PSP) in flexible configurations to provide seating, litter stanchions, and medical equipment support for use on any airlift aircraft as required.  PSPs comprise several components that can be assembled in multiple configurations for various airframes missions.  These components include:  specially modified 463L pallets, litter stanchion sets, seats, pallet spacers and pallet ramps/extensions.  Each stanchion set will be capable of supporting three to four litters at adjustable intervals, depending on overhead clearance in particular airframe.  Spacers provide a suitable walking surface to eliminate unsafe gaps between pallets installed on cargo rollers, while ramps and extensions eliminate tripping hazards for personnel moving between a pallet surface elevated on cargo rollers and the aircraft cargo deck.  PSPs would be configurable as follows:  (1) all litter configuration with a center aisle, (2) all litter configuration with a side aisle, (3) all seat configuration, and (4) mixed configuration of a single stanchion set with a row of seats across a center aisle.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for the PSPs is intended to be released within the next two months.  Request that interested offerors provide copies of commercial brochures, applicable briefings, and/or white papers (less than twenty (20) pages in length) submitted in writing by 27 Jan 03.  All written responses shall be submitted to 311 HSW/YASK, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks AFB, TX 78235-5119,

<DESC>The Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), is in the process of standardizing general cleaning materials used aboard U.S. Navy ships. Presently, ships carry a large variety of routine maintenance and shipboard sanitation.  These products can vary in both cleaning efficiency and the degree of safety and health precautions necessary for their use. The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the safety and health aspects (i.e., reduce personal protective equipment requirements (PPE)), and environmental friendliness of the cleaning products that the Navy uses afloat without compromising the mission.  A secondary goal is to reduce the proliferation of numerous authorized cleaning agents listed on the Ship's Hazardous Materials List (SHML).  NSWCCD-SSES is currently in the process of drafting Technical Purchase Desc riptions (TPDs) for hand soaps (used in dispensing systems), hand cleaners (used with or without dispensing systems), and metal polishes (for silver, brass).  These five TPDs describing the requirements for the listed cleaning applications are posted on our website at http://www.dt.navy.mil/acquisition/ (see link below).    NSWCCD-SSES is soliciting product information from all manufacturers whose products meet the TPD requirements.   The attachment "Cleaning Products Submissions" details documentation requirements and forwarding addresses.   All interested vendors may forward comments and product information to Ms. Christine Socha (215) 897-7499 or Ms. Sarah Phillips (215) 897-7401, fax (215) 897-1664.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number AB1330-03-RP-0033 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-11, effective 12/31/02. The Government intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to the University of Hawaii as it is believed there are no other sources for this need. The U of H is the only source for the following reasons: Hawaii Mapping Research Group's MR1 Towed Seafloor Mapping System is a shallow-towed (~100 m depth) sonar array operating at 11/12 kHz that provides bathymetric swaths up to 25 km wide in width at survey speeds up to 9 knots. It is essential to use a system with the specifications of MR1 in order to have complete compatibility in resolution, gains etc. in order to make a seamless match to previous surveys (performed in 1997 and 2001).  The MR1 is the only known system available capable of providing broad-swath (up to 25 km), high-resolution seafloor surveys at the required frequency of 11/12 kHz at full vessel transit speeds and in high sea states. The MR1 system is operated by a staff of engineers and scientists from the U of H with long experience in acoustic imagery and familiarity with the MR1.  Complete installation and operation of the MR1 will be performed by the U of H staff on board the ship.  This announcement is for informational purposes only and proposals from other contractors will not be considered.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 541370. A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if its size standard is $4 million.   

A.	Introduction  The Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory proposes to explore, systematically map, and survey the Mariana Island Arc in order to discover the extent and character of active hydrothermal activity and recent volcanic activity.  

The Government requires the use of a HIG Acoustic Wide Angle Imaging Instrument, Mapping Researcher 1 with operators in order to satisfy its need.  The system leased must have a portable side-scanning sea floor imaging system that simultaneously acquires digital bathymetry (swath width > 3.4 times water depth) and sidescan sonar imagery (swath width > 7.5 times water depth).  The system's sonar transducers must be in a tow vehicle which has the ability to be towed beneath the surface mixed layer (60m to 100m) at ship speeds of 8 to 10 knots.  The tow vehicle must be operational in rough sea conditions (up to sea state 6).  The system must have the capability to be re-calibrated at any time during the survey to account for changing water column properties.   As bathymetry and acoustic data are collected, real-time images will be displayed on the acquisition monitor while raw acoustic data is redundantly archived.  A complete backup acquisition computer system will be available in a ready state in order to mitigate data loss due to computer failure.  After archival, the contractor personnel on board will merge bathymetry and imagery data with navigation and further process the data set to maximize data quality according to the specific environmental characteristics of the survey area. Sidescan image processing tools shall include amplitude normalization, destriping and despeckling routines that can be applied interactively or in batch-processing mode.  Sidescan bathymetry mosaics will be generated in near-real time at sea, and displayed on computer monitors, output to printers, or exported as digital data that can be easily imported into other display programs or geographic information systems.  The sonar system and crew are to arrive at Apra, Guam no later than 2/6/03.  The sonar towfish, winch, launching platform, van and other essentials will be loaded onto the vessel (Thomas G. Thompson) and tested on deck to ensure all equipment is in working order.  The contractor will supply a party chief, an engineer, and two data processors to operate the system and process the data at sea.  The sonar system will be used during the approximate period from 2/9/03 to 3/5/03 to survey portions of the Mariana volcanic arc between 12 N and 24 N latitude and 140  to 147 E longitude.  The exact limits of the surveys will be determined by the Chief Scientist/COTR.  During periods of use, contractor personnel will acquire data and monitor the system on a 24-hour per day basis.  Data collected during the cruise will be processed by contractor personnel into chart form at a scale designated by the Chief Scientist/COTR.  All data collected with the sonar system during the expedition will be transferred in digital form in formats compatible with use in the Generic Mapping Tools software package and provided to the Chief Scientist/COTR at the end of the expedition.  

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision. Offers shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer. FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision. FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and the following additional FAR clause cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition: 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, with Alternate I (41 U.S.C. 253g and 10U.S.C. 2402), 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals, 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (15 U.S.C. 637 (d)(2) and (3),  52.219-14,Limitation on Subcontracting 915 U.S.C. 637(a)(14), 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (E.O. 11246), 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers (29 U.S.C. 793), 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.225-3, Buy American Act- Supplies(41 U.S.C.10) and 52.225-9, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements Act-Balance of Payments Program(41 U.S.C. 10,19 U.S.C.2501-2582) .

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation notice for the development and deployment of COTS products in support of the United States Capitol Police (USCP) Administrative Systems Modernization Program.  This announcement serves as the notice to provide information regarding the Modernization Program as stated in RFI-USCP-02-001 which identified the need to modernize administrative systems using COTS solutions.  Based on the RFI and internal resources, the USCP strategy is to use a combination of existing capabilities and solicit for those capabilities that cannot be resourced by the USCP.  The USCP will use existing resources and capabilities for the following components of the Modernization Program:  Personnel, Benefits, Labor Management, Training Status, Training Management System, and Fleet Management System.

For the Time and Attendance and Inventory Management Systems, it is anticipated that 2 solicitations will be released.  The Time and Attendance (T&A) is the first solicitation to be released and the anticipated release period is January 2003.  This Request for Proposal (RFP) is a full and open competition.  The USCP intends to issue a combination Firm Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursable contract for the development and implementation of the T&A System with a 1-year option period for a not-to-exceed period of 24 months.  The contractors are expected to propose solutions that are COTS based and must be able to be interfaced with existing internal and external systems.  All requirements will be mandatory unless otherwise noted in the solicitation.  However, contractors are encouraged to propose alternate approaches to addressing any requirement, which would result in improved services and/or reduced costs.  The contractor will be required to provide the proposed application description and features, and address the tasking which includes requirements review, implementation, acceptance testing, system documentation, reporting, training, and optional hardware and software requirements.  The USCP anticipates a two-phased selection approach.  The 1st phase will determine those offerors that are within the competitive range and evaluating those proposals based on the technical capability and the ability to meet the requirements.  The 2nd phase will consist of evaluating proposals based on scripted demonstrations at contractor locations.  The Time and Attendance solicitation will be available electronically by sending a request to USCP_Procurement@cap-police.senate.gov.  Please identify the Solicitation Number in the Subject line.

The Inventory Management System solicitation is anticipated to be released electronically in late FY03.

All proposals shall be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at USCP_Procurement@cap-police.senate.gov.  If hand delivered, they shall be delivered to the U.S. Capitol Police, 119 D St., NE, Washington, DC 20510, Attn: OFM, Procurement Division, Karen M.S.
