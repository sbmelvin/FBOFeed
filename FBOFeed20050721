CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of ! proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) has begun an assertive and systematic review of both public and private policies and initiatives aimed at improving the employment of people with disabilities. A primary building block in the sequential but complementary studies on employment is NCD’s currently underway Social Security/Transitioning to Work Study, examining the evidence-based practices that promote the return to work (and transition to work) of working age beneficiaries of the DI and SSI programs. The next building block will be this employment study, which will include the following major components: a) a thorough, systematic examination or “environmental scan” of the nexus between employment and the following areas:  transportation; housing; reasonable accommodations; education; health care; assistive technology; telecommunications; long-term services and supports, and telecommuting, among other topics; b)  the establishment of a business advisory committee and the conduction of public forums to solicit information and input on employment issues and practices; c) the development of informational issue briefs that examine the status and impact of existing employment strategies at the federal, state and local level, such as customized employment, entrepreneurship, telework, supported employment, microbusiness, e-commerce, and competitive employment; and d) a cohesive final report with information drawn from the environmental scan, business advisory committee, public forums and informational briefs along with recommendations aimed at improving the employment status of people with disabilities. This employment study will be conducted at the same time that NCD undertakes a complementary research initiative on financial incentives available to enhance the ability of people with disabilities to live and work independently and in the community of their choice.  The estimated contract period is 12 months.  NCD will distribute its Employment Study Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on February 4, 2005.  NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by March 22, 2005.  Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up on or after the issue date of February 4, 2005.  All requests must reference the RFP number and title.  For more information, contact Joan Durocher, 1331 F Street, N.W., Suite 850, Washington, D.C. 20004, jdurocher@ncd.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for zero-cogging DC brushless motors.	It is desired that motors have 0 cog torque for smooth operation.  Also the motors must have a torque constant between 200 in-oz/amps and 250 in-oz/amps to reach the required torque and speed at system voltage.  A continuous stall torque greater than 900 in-oz is also required to ensure adequate thermal endurance.  As these motors will be used for space applications, it is desired to minimize both size and weight as much as possible (a frameless motor can be no greater than 5.5 inches in diameter and weigh no more than 5 lbs to work with existing designs).  Additionally motors must be manufactured with all thermal vacuum compatible materials and low outgassing materials that meet NASA requirements for space. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Aeroflex.  After an extensive market search it was found that Aeroflex was the only company capable of supplying zero-cogging motors that meet all of NASA/JSC's functional requirements torque, speed, size, and weight specifications. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 29, 2005.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for one (1) OmniScan Phased Array Unit (P/N OMNI-PA16-128)(includes: mainframe, 16-128 Phased Array acquisition module and 1 UT channel, acquisition software, AC adaptor, handle strap, 1 battery, 2 axis encoders (XY), 256 MB compact flash disk, and small carrying case).  Other accessories with the system are as follows:  (1) Angle Beam Linear Array Transducer 5 MHz 16 elts 8' or 2.5 m cable Omniscan connector; (2) Standard wedge for angle beam PA probe A1, longitudinal, 0 degree L; (3) Standard wedge, angle beam PA probe A1, shear wave, Normal scan, 45 degree S; (4) Standard wedge for angle beam PA probe A1, longitudinal wave, Normal scan, 45 degree; (5) Standard wedge for angle beam PA probe A1, normal scan, shear wave, 60 degree S; (6) Standard wedge for angle beam PA probe A1, normal scan, Longitudinal wave, 60 degree L; (7) Standard wedge for angle beam probe A0. (0 degree); (8) Standard wedge for angle beam probe A0 (45 degree shear); (9) Standard wedge for angle beam probe (60 degree shear); (10) Angle Beam Linear Array Transducer 10 MHz 10 elts 6x6 mm 2.5 m cable Omniscan connector (SIDE EXIT); (11) TomoView 2.2 software for acquisition and analysis including user manual; (12) Accessories kit including the following: 1 extra battery, 1 battery charger, 1 compact flash of 512 Mb, 1 compact flash reader, 1 external keyboard, 1 optical mouse, 1 back strapl (13) Mini-Encoder (includes bracket kit to fix the probe); (14)OmniScan Application Training (approximately 4 days -- excluding Travel and Living expenses). NASA Centers, Langley and Marshall, are currently utilizing this system and to maintain product consistency across NASA for collaborative research and development efforts associated with Shuttle, Station, and Crew Life Support spaceflight hardware, NASA Johnson must purchase the same system. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from R/D Tech Corporation, since the OmniScan system is unique to that manufacturer. OmniScan's phased arrays have several advantages over conventional ultrasound inspection.  The beam angle for each pulse can be modified, allowing the beam to sweep through a range of angles forming a sectorial scan.	Sectorial scans can cover a range of angles for out-of-plane defects (as evident in friction-stir welding and other advanced aerospace manufacturing techniques).  Phased arrays are also capable of a linear scan, which is useful for quick area inspection of aerospace materials.  No other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on August 3, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the Office Research and Development (ORD) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL) in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina which is seeking a contractor to conduct a study to determine the quantity of arsenic tracked into homes by foot traffic from CCA-treated decks. The contractor shall identify ten residences conforming to the needs of this study. A standardized list of questions will be developed to systematically characterize the decks and control surfaces of these residences to assure the appropriateness of their inclusion in this study. The contractor will utilize experimental methods involving the use of track-in platforms, simulated human track-in, and the sampling procedure used for testing the CCA-treated decks will be used for testing the control surfaces. Results from the study will indicate the quantity of arsenic tracked into homes by foot traffic from CCA-treated decks. The quantity of arsenic tracked off CCA-treated decks will be compared to the quantity of arsenic tracked off control surfaces.  This comparison will indicate if arsenic originates from the decks rather than from wind-blown soil containing arsenic. Dislodgeable arsenic on decks and control surfaces will be sampled using two different methods - the same method used for the CCA-treated Deck Coatings Study and the PUF foam roller method.  Results will be reported in units of mass of arsenic per area of deck or control surface.  The two methods will be compared. Dislodgeable arsenic on carpet will be sampled using two different methods - the PUF foam method and the vacuum method.  For both methods, results will be reported in units of mass of arsenic per area of carpet.  For the vacuum method, results will also be reported in units of mass of arsenic per mass of dislodgeable house dust.  The two methods will be compared. Undislodged arsenic in carpet will be determined using the 2" x 2" carpet samples after vacuuming.  Results will be reported in units of mass of arsenic per area of carpet. Results will provide the efficiency of mass transfer of dislodgeable arsenic from deck to carpet dust and from deck to carpet surface. The final report may be in the form of a manuscript to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. The North American Industry Classification Code is  with a small business size standard of $6 million.  A written solicitation, PR-CI-05-11127, is anticipated to be issued on Wednesday 8/10/05.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued as a request for quotes (RFQ).  All responsible businesses may submit a quotation in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the Agency.  This procurement will be pursued using FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition methods and procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In addition to price, the following factors will be used to evaluate the offeror?s technical proposal: relevant technical experience, quality of personnel, facilities and resources, and past performance.  These factors shall be evaluated on a Best Value basis.  Contract type will be firm fixed price.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) in Washington, DC intends to award a Purchase Order to the International Union of Air Pollution Prevention Protection Association (IUAPPA) of Brighton, England under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose of this purchase order is to complete a review of emission inventories across the European, Asian, and North American regions, finalize a discussion/policy review paper on Hemispheric Pollution, and hold a seminar  in Tokyo on new developments and challenges in regional air pollution.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620.    NO SOLICITATIONS OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that IUAPPA is uniquely qualified to satisfy  the Government's requirement as IUAPPA is the only organization leading international scientific and technical efforts on the hemispheric scale.  In addition they are the only source capable of drawing together all the relevant networks and research programs related to regional air pollution - from  the U.N. Environment Commission of Europe to the CLRTAP Convention to the Air Monitoring Network of East Asia (EANET).  As such, they alone will be able to access the senior technical and policy officials in these networks and their member countries, so that the scientific and policy analysis  needed for understanding and analyzing hemispheric transport of air pollutants will have the appropriate expertise to gain legitimacy and yield meaningful results.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if  received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to posting must be in writing and submitted to Denise Roberson, Contract Specialist at roberson.denise@epa.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Precision Engineering Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland. 

The service being procured requires significant expertise and a detailed understanding of the surface preparation and hydrogen termination physics of silicon surfaces which allows repeatable sample preparation and the development of nanometer scale surface lithography.  This work involves the development of an atomic scale understanding of silicon surface dynamics and the time dependence of silicon step flow characteristics.  The University of Maryland has significant expertise in silicon step flow modeling and dynamics.  They have an expertise in the Omicron UHV scanning tunneling systems as well as a detailed understanding of STM tip preparation and analysis.  They have developed significant capability for STM tip preparation and analysis using field ion and field electron analysis of Tungsten tips.

The University of Maryland has played a fundamental role in the success of the Atom-based Dimensional Metrology Project.  They have provided guidance and essential expertise in the development of surface preparation methods and STM operation of Silicon atomic-crystal lattice counting methods.  

This effort and the elements of this requirement are crucial to the development of nanolithography and nanomanufacturing of atom-based standards, the nanoscale metrology effort, and nanometrology based on atomic scale imaging. The University of Maryland has extensive expertise in automated sample preparation and ultra-high vacuum measurement of the crystal lattices, and significant contributions in the new diode laser interferometry system.  This aspect of the research work, and specifically the silicon surface preparation and silicon step flow dynamics work depends on their expertise.  They are also the key contributors to NIST’s new wet chemistry methods for preparing silicon wafer samples with atomically flat and ordered surfaces.  They have developed a detailed understanding of the surface preparation and hydrogen termination physics which has allowed repeatable sample preparation and the development of nanometer scale surface lithography.  This work is of significance and importance to NIST and is essential to enable new metrology methods for semiconductor manufacturing and nanoscale fabrication.  Several important publications have resulted from this work.  The continuity of the University of Maryland and their commitment to this effort is essential to the development, progress and continued success of this project.

Market research of several other Universities and small businesses has not revealed an alternative source.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690, and the size standard of $6 Million.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, parties that can provide this service noted above may respond to this notice to indicate their capabilities in detail so that NIST may evaluate them.  Such notice shall be provided by August 4, 2005.  The Government will then determine whether this procurement can be competed.  A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition will be based upon responses to this notice.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a 5-year, sole-source contract with the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) located in Silver Spring, Maryland, for the purpose of designing, implementing, and evaluating the use of Pediatric Medical Units (PMU).  This contract is a continuation of the Children’s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Project conducted by AUCD in conjunction with the University Centers For Excellence In Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) and the Leadership Education in Neuro-developmental Disabilities (LEND) programs.  The PMU teams will consist of experts in a wide range of pediatric specialties. The PMUs will assist State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in identifying and obtaining appropriate and sufficient medical documentation to allow the disability examiners to make decisions as early in the disability adjudication process as possible. These PMUs will support the DDS by providing additional information and consultation on the childhood cases the DDS deems the most difficult to adjudicate. This contract will support two major goals of the Agency: 1) the development and evaluation of PMUs and 2) the study of a potential expedited benefit process for children with certain disabilities determined to meet the current definition of disability.  Both projects will further the Agency’s plan for improving the disability determination process. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training System Division (TSD) in Orlando, FL, intends to award a sole source contract to BMH Associates, Inc., a small business, located at 5365 Robin Hood Road, Norfolk, VA 23513 to provide engineering services for completion of the Phase III design, development, enhancement, test and maintenance requirements of the Mission Rehearsal Tactical Team Trainer (MRT3).  BMH is currently contracted by other projects to provide instructor controls and monitoring (IOS) functionality to Navy projects and is the Navy support agent for the Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) simulation.  The unique combination of knowledge uniquely supports the required rapid transition of IOS and JSAF innovations into the MRT3 project.  BMH is required to complete Phase III enhancements of the MRT3 trainer so that the Government has a stable product baseline and documentation upon which future requirements can be competed.  The Government anticipates pursuing full and open competition for future MRT3 design, development, enhancement, test and maintenance requirements required after Phase III of the MRT3 project is completed.  BMH is currently the only known source uniquely capable of efficiently and rapidly bringing resources with diverse project knowledge required to solve complex engineering development and integration issues.  Pursuing award through competition would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements.  The resulting contract will be cost plus fixed fee and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The anticipated contract award date is 10 September 2005 with performance lasting 12 months from date of contract award.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) intends to enter into negotiations with the BMH Associates, Inc., ten (10) days after publication of this notice.  Questions regarding the requisite technical capabilities required to perform the services for this sole source acquisition may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Kate Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil or NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD), 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Kate Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center, Directorate of Contracting, Edwards Air Force Base California, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Viasat.  This acquisition is for a Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Flight Recorder.  It connects directly to the Support Port of the MIDS terminal without the need for a device to convert from the terminal's AUI format to Ethernet.  In addition to recording all transmitted and received messages, the Support Port records data not normally available on the 1553 bus including transmissions originated by the terminal such as its own PPLI, Initial Entry messages, machine receipts, and relayed messages, as well as navigation performance data, signal quality measurements, and digitized voice.  In addition to the AUI interface, the Flight Recorder includes two 1 PPS timing signals inputs.  The fractional difference between these is periodically measured and recorded to facilitate correlating Link-16 data (time-tagged with JTIDS network time) with TSPI data (time-tagged with GPS UTC time).  The recorded data is stored on removable Compact Flash.  A software utility package is included which allows the Test Analyst to specify exactly what data is to be recorded (FIMs, FOMs, DTBs, IDBs) without impacting the mission computer.  This software package also includes data extraction routines to support analysis of the recorded data.  The Flight Recorder requires 28V aircraft power, weighs less than 5 lbs, draws less than 5 amps, and meets the following environmental specifications:
 
Operating temperature	-20°C to +71°C
Non-Operating Storage temperature	-40°C to +71°C
Humidity	100% relative humidity, with condensation
Altitude	50,000 ft.
Explosive Atmosphere	50,000 ft per MIL-STD-810 method 511.3 Procedure I
Random Vibration	30 minutes each axis
Gunfire Vibration	12” from muzzle, sinusoidal over random, 15 minutes each axis
Crash Safety	40 Gs longitudinal, 20 Gs vertical, 15 Gs lateral
EMI	MIL-STD-461E

<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) throughout the country of Iraq. The MATOC is a contract for execution of a broad range of 132kV and 400kV electrical overhead line maintenance, repair and construction tasks, possibly including design work.     Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual 132kV and 400kV electrical overhead line construction tasks, including design/build new, renovation/rehabilitation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in civil, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual Task Order. Individual Task Orders may range between an estimated $3,000,000 to $45,000,000. The program value is expected to be approximately $100,000,000 over a one-year period.        Contractors shall complete all work under this contract in accordance with schedules that are established in each Task Order. Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of construction and renovation projects. Submittal dates will be included in the individual Task Orders. These dates identify when information is due in the issuing Government office and other addresses identified in the individual Task Orders to where data may be submitted. The types and numbers of submittals and dates and places for review meetings shall be established by each Task Order under this contract.      This solicitation will incorporate a representative seed project upon which all proposals will be evaluated for award.  The seed project will be for all services necessary to design, supply, construction, installation and commissioning activities necessary to provide a fully functional 132kV overhead line from Hilla South to Hashemiya in the Babil Governate. The magnitude of this seed project is expected to be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 (USD). The work for this project is expected to be completed within 210 days after issuance of Notice to Proceed.      The seed project will be awarded to the offeror whose offer is determined to be most advantageous to the Government for the first award. Up to an additional three (3) awards may be made to offerors whose offers are also advantageous to the Government, based upon the stated evaluation criteria. The Government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3). In using this best value approach, the Government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Government the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements, affordably. While the Government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective. This may result in an award being made to higher technically rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the solicitation and the source selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the price difference.      All successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $4,000,000. The Government intends to compete future individual requirements among the MATOC awardees.  Offerors are encouraged to scrutinize the solicitation carefully when posted for more detailed information.      This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. The solicitation for this effort is expected to be issued on or about 05 August 2005 and will be posted on our website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net/ .

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Construction & Equipment Directorate, is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime vendor for the roll out of the Facilities Maintenance Services Initiative.

The areas to be targeted include but are not limited to: building repairs, roofing, paving, painting, plumbing, pipefitting, heating, air conditioning, locksmith services, elevator maintenance, electrical, glasswork, demolition, lawn maintenance, and facility operations.  The initial implementation was awarded in September of 2001 for the Northeast Region of the United States.  The first roll out was awarded in April of 2004 for the Southeast Region.  This rollout region is defined as the Southwest Region.  The target audience will include military bases and all other DoD and Federal agencies within the region.  The Southwest Region has been divided into three (3) zones as follows: Zone 1 – Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah; Zone 2 – Hawaii; Zone 3 – Guam.  Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10,000.00 to a maximum of $50 million annually for Zone 1 and $10 million annually for Zones 2 & 3.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Products under this contractual vehicle will be available for lease or purchase.   IT products procured through this acquisition are required to comply with DoD and Army standards, such as the DoD Information Technology Standards Registry.   The acquisition will use a modular approach, which will provide vendors the option of proposing all three, two, or one module(s). The Army intends to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts.  The contracts will have a ten-year period of performance, with a three year base period, three two-year options, and one one-year option.  The Government will conduct th e acquisition under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. The government intends to conduct a full and open competition with three awards reserved for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisiti on is 334111(Electronic Computer Manufacturing) with small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  Contractors will be required to support up to a Secret security clearance.  Some orders may require Top Secret (TS) Sensitive Compartmented Information ( SCI) for on-site warranty support.  This acquisition will not be a set-aside for small business concerns because it requires large quantities of deliverables, with world-wide delivery and warranty service requirements, in a time-constrained manner. The Contractor shall provide a commercial w arranty with a minimum duration of three (3) years, to all locations within and Outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) for all desktops and notebooks delivered.  All other products shall be provided with the commercial warranty.  The Contract or shall offer extended warranty to be purchased separately at the customer's discretion.

Commercial shipping is required, in lieu of devel oping a shipping mechanism reliant upon Government personnel intervention.  Due to the security limitations in South Korea and delays associated with custom clearance, limited Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) will be included for that count ry to enable contract performance.  Shipping to the address(es) specified on each delivery order shall be within 30 calendar days for CONUS and 35 calendar days for OCONUS locations.  The price of shipping CONUS will be included in the fixed price of the p roduct.  The price of shipping OCONUS will be handled as an ODC within certain restraints.

<DESC>Work performance will be successful contractor’s place of performance. The areas serviced under the proposed solicitation will be locations within the Naval Facilities Engineering Command’s world-wide area of responsibility. The estimated volume of invoices is between 11,000 - 50,000 monthly from all Navy Installations within the United States and Overseas as follows:  1) An estimated 500 foreign invoices originate in Japan and incorporate both English and Japanese on the invoice 2) An estimated 500 foreign invoices originate in overseas including Naval bases in the UK, Iceland, Greece, Egypt, Bahrain, Korea, Singapore, and Spain with an additional 450 invoices from Italy, 5) Foreign invoices shall be retained in the originating country’s currency/language, 6) Foreign utility invoice data shall be loaded in English, and retained in the originating country’s currency. The successful contractor must have a minimum of three (3) years’ experience with ITRON software in order to build a minimum of 11,000 templates within 90 days of contract award.  The successful contractor must have a minimum of five (5) years experience performing Utilities Accounts Payable services for commercial or governmental clients. Up to 113 separate data fields are to be tracked for all utility commodities.  Additional information is provided as follows: 
A. 1. Financial Auditability:  Each year the vendor must conduct an independent SAS 70 Type II audit to ensure government controls, processes, and quality assurance programs are in order.  This review is managed external to client operations and includes a comprehensive assessment of control objectives and procedures within the areas of client operations, IT and connectivity/security.  Additionally, this review should include additional enhanced control objectives that address the government’s evolving equivalent financial standards. The vendor pays for this service, and, per contractual obligations, the results are made available to the government.  
2. The vendor must also be able to demonstrate ISO compliance or equivalent financial certification.
B. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI):  The vendor must be able to accept the following EDI transactions for processing within the local system for validation and utility management. The vendors system must be able to demonstrate a workflow management capability with the integration to ITRON software and be able to be uploaded into CIRCUITS. The vendor must be able to collect both cost and consumption data from the major utility suppliers via EDI standards listed below. 
# 810 v4010 Invoice (Consolidated Billing)
# 867 v4010 Inventory Information (Meter Data)
Note: These transaction standards are based on the NAESB implementation conventions.
C. Work Flow Management:  Once an Invoice has been received, an automated workflow process must be utilized to manage the movement of the invoice between users of the system and the associated states. The vendor system must be able to demonstrate the capability to handle multi-level workflow.  Examples could be from 10-20 levels of workflow.
D. Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity:  The vendor must have Business Continuity Plan that is designed to maintain business continuity in the event of disaster of any type, including a “total” loss of all facilities and technology within our general service facilities and Network Operations Centers.
1.Short-term power and networking stabilization 
2.Spare critical hardware components and equipment
3.Stable hot site recovery locations deployable within 48 hours 
4.Mobile hot site units at the Government’s disposal within 8 hours notice.
5.Available capacity for seats in fully configured, networked space within 4 hours
The following are different categories of disasters the Plan addresses:
a) Environmental Disasters - environmental disasters caused by a loss of certain equipment or services needed by the organization in order to maintain operations; examples include utility outages (phone lines/electrical services) and loss of computer support equipment
b) Natural Disasters - caused by such natural events as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, fires, etc.
c) Man Made Disasters - include anything maliciously done by an individual such as bombings, fires, vandalism, computer viruses, etc.
d) Restricted Access - event that occurs resulting in restricted access to the facilities for a prolonged period of time (i.e., more than 48 hours)
e) Standard Procedures – in addition to the even driven categories discussed above, the vendor needs standardized processes and procedures that are reviewed and assessed on an annual basis as a component of their annual SAS 70, Type II review
This Plan is reviewed and assessed as a component of an annual SAS 70,Type II review.
E. Technology and Investment:  In order to present year over year financial benefit the vendor will need to demonstrate investments in technology in the form of:
1.Scanning and Imaging
2. Intelligent Data Capture
3. Electronic data Interchange with the large Suppliers
4. Workflow Management
5. Sophisticated web reports
6. Provider self service
7. Customer service systems
8. On and off-site document storage and archiving
9. Large scale electronic data storage and archiving (data retention required for 5 years minimum)
10. Data security in compliance with Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) and Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PCI).   
F. 1. Criminal and Background Checking:  Since we are dealing in the arena of financial disbursements and we want to ensure we eliminate employees prone to fraud and theft, the vendor will use an outside firm with a minimum of 10 years of experience in providing criminal, drug, credit, and other relevant personal background testing.
2. Key elements of this process include all qualified applicants (full, part time or temporary) submitting to these tests including an 80-question audit designed to provide a predictive indicator of an applicants tendencies toward theft, substance abuse and honesty.
3. All employees must achieve base line levels of acceptability within all areas discussed above.  Any potential employee, regardless of level, who falls outside of the tolerance, will be removed from consideration.
4. Additional Security Clearances may be required for all employees if determined by the government.
All technical inquiries will be addressed after issuance of the solicitation and should be forwarded in writing.

<DESC>This modification corrects formatting errors in the presolication notice.The National Council on Disability (NCD) has begun an assertive and systematic review of both public and private policies and initiatives aimed at improving the employment of people with disabilities. A primary building block in the sequential but complementary studies on employment is NCD’s currently underway Social Security/Transitioning to Work Study, examining the evidence-based practices that promote the return to work (and transition to work) of working age beneficiaries of the DI and SSI programs. The next building block will be this employment study, which will include the following major components: a) a thorough, systematic examination or “environmental scan” of the nexus between employment and the following areas:  transportation; housing; reasonable accommodations; education; health care; assistive technology; telecommunications; long-term services and supports, and telecommuting, among other topics; b)  the establishment of a business advisory committee and the conduction of public forums to solicit information and input on employment issues and practices; c) the development of informational issue briefs that examine the status and impact of existing employment strategies at the federal, state and local level, such as customized employment, entrepreneurship, telework, supported employment, microbusiness, e-commerce, and competitive employment; and d) a cohesive final report with information drawn from the environmental scan, business advisory committee, public forums and informational briefs along with recommendations aimed at improving the employment status of people with disabilities. This employment study will be conducted at the same time that NCD undertakes a complementary research initiative on financial incentives available to enhance the ability of people with disabilities to live and work independently and in the community of their choice.  The estimated contract period is 12 months.  NCD will distribute its Employment Study Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on February 4, 2005.  NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by March 22, 2005.  Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up on or after the issue date of February 4, 2005.  All requests must reference the RFP number and title.  For more information, contact Joan Durocher, 1331 F Street, N.W., Suite 850, Washington, D.C. 20004, jdurocher@ncd.gov.

1) Add the four lower level USAID Intermediate Results (IR) areas anticipated within the Justice Reform and Modernization Program. They are:      

a)	IR 1.1.1:  Effective National Implementation of the new Criminal Procedures (Accusatory System) Reform (CPAR) ¡V including: improved inter-institutional coordination among justice sector entities; enhanced judicial school capacity to provide functional and specialized skills training for judges, clerks and court administrators; training of public defenders and staff in the new accusatory system; refurbishing and equipping priority courts, Judicial Service Centers and public defense offices, to conform them to the requirements of the new accusatory system.     

b)	IR 1.1.2:  Strengthened Court Administration and Management (CAM) ¡V including, design and implementation of effective caseflow management and delay reduction systems that attend to the issues and complexities of fair case processing in primarily criminal court jurisdictions.

c)	IR 1.1.3:  Increased Access to Justice (ATJ ) -- especially for the poor and disenfranchised ¡V through expanded availability of public defense, legal assistance and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services; also, modest expansion of regional justice houses in priority (isolated or conflict affected) jurisdictions. 
d)	IR 1.1.4:  Responsive Judicial Processes for Peace  (JPP) ¡V enhanced capacity of the Foreign Ministry, judiciary, inspector general office (Procuraduria) and public defense to effectively plan for and manage responses to transition to peace requirements through three sub-areas:
„X	IR 1.1.4.1 Improved management of human rights cases in both national jurisdictions and international courts; 
„X	IR 1.1.4.2 Strengthened judicial processes related to demobilization of former members of illegal armed groups; and 
„X	IR 1.1.4.3 Support administration of new jurisdictions and processes for ¡§truth, justice and reparation¡¨, as required by enactment of a ¡§Justice and Peace¡¨ law and future implementing regulations.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Amendment #3:  Technical Question & Answer.  The original response date of 07/22/05, has been changed to 07/25/05, at 3:00 pm (EST).  Question:  We have not found that source code or detailed schematics of all electronic circuits  necessary for field trouble shooting.  The vehicle's housing is sealed and normally never opened by the customer.  Fins, propellers, keel weights, and external sensors are field repairable without opening the housing and most are provided in the spares kit.  For added levels of repair necessitating  opening the housing, we can provide procedures for swapping major components such as the battery tray or tail section.  Do we need to provide all of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits to enable field  troubleshooting? Answer:  The EPA does not need the electronic diagrams, but the electric diagrams would be required so that the EPA gets a schematic showing circuitry from battery/fuse to sensors to controller to motor/rudders/propellers, etc., with electronic components blackboxed.  If the  instrumentation control and navigation software has code that is open to end users, then the source code should be provided.  But if the code is closed to end users, then the EPA does not need to see it- just indicate in your proposal that it is closed.   Amendment #2:  Technical question and  answer.  The original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. The 90 days to deliver from start of the contract is tight.  We can deliver a working AUV system to EPA within the 90 days but it would not be fitted with the high performance navigation module. The AUV that would be delivered  within the 90 days would be operational and it would be adequate for the EPA technician to start using the AUV and navigating via dead reckoning.  The additional module can be delivered within 150 days of contract start or 60 days after the base unit is delivered. Is this acceptable? Answer:  Yes,  that is acceptable Amendment #1 Information:   Technical Question & Answers AUV Requirement,  The Original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. Would there be a problem using a Russian built fuselage with a U.S. designed and built drive and electronics?  Answer:  There is no prohibition  against using a Russian built fuselage, as long as commonly replaced parts (such as O-rings) are readily available (i.e., if the fuselage comes with unusually sized O-rings that are difficult to purchase for replacement, that would be unacceptable). We use high mega-pixel Japanese built SLRs and  specialized Japanese video cameras.  In our system we use a video camera and an SLR - we have the video camera coupled to the eyepiece of the SLR, so that both video and an SLR still use the same optical chain.  Would such a system implementation be acceptable? Answer:   Yes. This is a combined  synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The  current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The specifications for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are as follows:    Synopsis: An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an advanced technology,  multipurpose swimming robot that can effectively measure environmental parameters used to access ecological health and species-habitat interactions in aquatic environments.  AUVs  can be configured with a variety of sensor packages to measure water quality, with video cameras to map habitats and  biota (e.g. shellfish), and with side scan sonar to acoustically image seabed properties in both shallow and deep environments. This instrument will be a key component in a variety of research projects at AED in the Habitat Effects Branch, which currently is conducting research in support of the  Aquatic Stressors Framework's plan for Altered Habitat Research and focuses on coastal marshes, estuaries, and near shore habitats at the scale of habitat elements and habitat mosaics up to and including entire coastal ecosystems.   The Aquatic Stressors Framework states that spatial habitat  mapping will be a "vital tool" in application of the stressor-response models, and thus habitat mapping of shorelines, lakes, estuaries, and sub-estuaries should be a part of the quantitative research involved in creating the models.  AUVs are ideal tools for assessing and mapping habitats and  biota over large spatial scales and at speeds comparable to the rate processes of interest.  By outfitting the AUV with a video camera, side scan sonar unit, CTD and dissolved oxygen probe, real-time measurements of habitat quality and quantity (e.g. bottom topography, presence of shellfish beds,  dissolved oxygen levels, stratification, seagrass bed areal extent and level of patchiness) can be collected relatively rapidly.  The habitat and biota data collected by the AUV will be essential for ground truthing, over large spatial scales, the habitat alteration (stressor)-species response  models and habitat suitability indices currently under development by the Habitat Effects Branch.  This instrument will contribute to research that will (1) synthesize habitat quantity, quality, or arrangement (stressors), and (2) quantitatively relate these habitat alteration stressors to fish,  shellfish, or wildlife (responses), thus supporting the Altered Habitat Research Plan's APM 5 (Report characterizing relationships of between abundance, quality, and arrangement of various habitat types ad selected biotic assessment endpoints in coastal systems) and APM 6 (Synthesized quantitative  species-habitat relationships suitable for developing regional habitat-based bio-criteria for shorelines, lakes and estuaries).  As dissolved oxygen level is an assessment endpoint for the Watershed Diagnostics Branch, the AUV, equipped with the fast-response dissolved oxygen sensor, will be a  valuable research tool for this branch as well (APM- Report on the sensitivity of food web responses to nutrient loading coastal systems). In addition, the potential exists for the AUV to be used as a tool for large scale monitoring and assessment efforts in a range of habitats in support of the  Coastal Assessment (Goal 8) and Aquatic Stressors (Goal 2) research efforts. Furthermore, we can conceive potential uses of the AUV at Gulf Ecology Division (GED), Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED), Western Ecology Division (WED) and by EPA regions and partners.   General Specifications: o	The  AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small and light (see specific specifications list). o	The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf  components. o	All of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is also required. o	The modular hull sections must be lightweight and  constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings. o	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6?C to 35?C and remain unharmed for storage, and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from  -10?C to 45?C.   o	A connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector. o	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring  must be facilitated with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation. o	The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data, to  the remote computer. o	The AUV should have a secondary transponder (i.e., pinger locator device) in case of loss of AUV.		 o	The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.	 o	When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using  dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates. o	While the AUV is at the surface, a geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or  differential GPS. o	The AUV package must include rugged shipping containers for all components. o	The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship. o	The  AUV package must include an expendable items spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV  components.  A list of part numbers and pricing must be included for all custom AUV components. o	AUV demonstrations by the Contractor must be organized and conducted by the Contractor in coordination with the government representatives.  For these demonstrations, only the costs associated with the  government representatives' meals, incidental expenses, lodging, and the transportation will be incurred by the government.  All other costs of the demonstrations are to be incurred by the Contractor.   o	Post-award AUV on-site services shall include training on all AUV hardware and software  systems. o	The operational performance and specification compliance of the candidate AUV must be fully demonstrated to U.S. EPA's AED scientists prior to acceptance of the AUV and associated payment in-full. o	Software must meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Minimum  Specifications: o	Length: 1.5-3 m o	Weight:   < 100 kg o	Depth rating:  > 100 m o	Sustained (mission) speed:  > 3 knots o	Endurance at mission speed: > 6 hours or 18 nautical miles o	Re-power: via externally rechargeable batteries (through externally accessible connector) and/or easy (< 15 minute)  battery swap procedure o	Navigation:  GPS and inertial navigation, without transponders o	Control Interface:  Vehicle is capable of total autonomy, and provides user-friendly ability to pre-determine vehicle path in 3D by lat/lons as well as by depth and altitude, including a capability for  oscillation patterns with depth/altitude.  Knowledge of specialized computer languages not required. o	Sensor suite and internally recorded parameters:  date, time, conductivity, temperature, depth, altitude, dissolved oxygen, latitude, longitude, heading, speed, battery voltage, and scaled images  (see camera requirements below)  o	Maximum equilibration time for all sensors, including dissolved oxygen:  0.3 seconds. o	Minimum data rate for internally recording the above parameters:  1.0 hertz (exception: camera, see below). o	Camera requirements: 480 line video camera at video rate or  (preferred) high-resolution (> 1.0 mega-pixel) still camera at 0.5 hertz or better.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.   THERE IS NO SOLLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.    This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the Government.  Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information, not a request for proposal.  It is requested that information in response to this RFI be submitted NO LATER THAN August 22, 2005 to Ms. Alice Tornquist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-3, Highway 547, Lakehurst NJ 08733 or by email at alice.tornquist@navy.mil.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.  Respondents may provide information on any currently available product that meets the Navy’s requirements.  Respondents may also provide information on any successful product nearing the end of its Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II development effort or items in Phase III that meet the Navy’s requirements.  SBIR items must clearly state their current status.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to the availability of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) reliable devices to build a Navy hydrogen fueled technology demonstrator Aviation Support Vehicle (ASV).  This ASV will provide both towing and Mobile Electric Power (MEP) capabilities.  All devices must correctly function in a hostile environment (+150 degrees F to –50 degrees F @ 100% humidity in both salt spray and blowing sand as well as +/- 15 degrees of pitch and roll).  NAVAIR Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen storage tanks (both gaseous and liquid), and accessories (required to integrate, service, and control the fuel cells and storage tanks).  The primary fuel cell must provide at least 90kva of continuous power for a minimum of 14 hours.  The operating time required is normal usage for two shifts doing continuous aircraft troubleshooting and is in no way related to the vehicle’s on-board fuel capacity.   To facilitate the use of commercial grade hydrogen, information is requested for inline purifiers to provide the fuel cell with laboratory grade (or better) hydrogen of the correct properties for use by the fuel cell.  These devices may be of any design consistent with the limited space available in any mobile USN vehicle (the ASV demonstrator).  Use of an instant start type fuel cell to act as a battery in the vehicle is planned and information is requested on these devices.  The use of this device will allow systems check at key turn and time for the main stack to come on line at full potential.  Those responding to this RFI are requested to provide fuel consumption figures/charts, reliability (Mean-Time-Between-Failure), maintainability data, and electrical output specifics (max continuous amperage available, etc) for their units, if available.  Respondents are also requested to provide commercial pamphlets, operating and maintenance manuals or any other documentation that would describe a unit that meets the above requirements.  Respondents may provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing for all items vetted with pricing valid FY 2005 through 2007, inclusive.  Pricing will be used for planning purposes.  Please contact Mr. Anthony Verzella, at 732-323-1511 or email anthony.verzella@navy.mil for questions regarding the technical aspects of this RFI.

Pool dimensions are as follows:  54'x165' (approximately 13,500 sf surface area) and 65'x84' (approximately 8600 sf surface area), respectively. The government desires a cementitious surfaced, elastic plastic, waterproof sealed finish system with a 7-10 year minimum warranty for materials and craftsmanship.  Pools will be required to have caution and depth markings, as well as being colored and trimmed to match the existing individual pool schemes. Respondents to this RFI should fully explain their proposed systems benefits and provide technical data to support their recommendation. Promotional specifications literature and material safety data sheets (MSDS) regarding these systems' component materials should include the following information for engineering evaluation purposes:  performance data regarding compressive, flexural, tensile and impact strengths; shear bond adhesion; abrasion, chemical, fire, moisture, mildew and wet/dry slip resistances; water absorption; cured weight; freeze-thaw contraction-expansion; accelerated weathering; flame spread; wind uplift and hail/ wind driven rain penetration susceptibilities and shrinkage rate as applicable. Respondents should also provide the recommended crafts and/or trades with suggested manpower hours, based only on the description and pool dimensions given above Respondents should e-mail responses to Aaron.Sams@sheppard.af.mil no later than 5 August 2005. Responses may be used by this organization in developing optimum technical specifications for a contract that may be proposed in the future.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only. The U.S. Department of the Army, Research, Development, Engineering Command (RDECOM), is conducting market research and seeking sources in the area of Research and Development of Radio Frequency Directe d Energy Weapon Concepts. Generally, the Governments needs include contracted efforts in the following fields of discipline: Protection from Electromagnetic (EM) Environments; Testing and Evaluation of EM Hardened Systems; Transportable Nuclear Reactors; Photon Quasi-pencil Beams; Dose Rate Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Electronic Systems; Photovoltaic Power Sources; Nuclear Batteries; Small Engine Power Sources; and, Capacitor Technology and Power Electronics all of which are founded on the following b ackground information: Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon (RF DEW) Concepts - The Directed Energy and Power Generation Division (DEPGD) of the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has been tasked by the Armys Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) to investigate  the feasibility of developing Radio RF DEW concepts for Army applications, such as counter mine/booby trap, counter munitions, vehicle/area self-protect and air defense. ARL is also responsible for researching, designing and developing the technology nece ssary to build concept demonstrators and helping RDECOM evaluate their effectiveness.  To investigate the feasibility of an RF DEW concept, it is necessary to first determine the RF field strength and/or power density that must be incident on a target system to produce electronic upset and/or damage sufficient for a functional kill (i.e., ta rget effects/susceptibility level). These target susceptibility levels are then combined with the users desired target engagement range to develop power/energy and system requirements for RF DEW concepts. Based on these requirements, a survey of RF source  technology (i.e. transmitters, antenna, power supplies, etc) is conducted to determine if the current technology meets the requirements or whether gaps exist that must be addressed. If possible, breadboard systems are developed to show proof of principle and to provide the basis for RDECS to further develop and transition to program managers (PMs). Finally ARL helps the RDECs/PM evaluate the effectiveness of the concept by conducting both analytical and experimental investigations as needed. More specifically, the Governments needs are amplified to include: Protection from Electromagnetic (EM) environments - Command, Control, and Communications (C3) systems and associated facilities are subjected to a broad array of intense, natural and threat related EM environments including the High-Altitude Electromagneti c Pulse (HEMP), lightning, and other RF directed energy waveforms.  ARL is responsible for providing guidance to the organizations responsible for achieving and maintaining sufficient protection of C3 systems and facilities from these EM threats.  Test and Evaluation of EM hardened Systems - Involves hardening of assets to a wide range of EM environments world-wide.  This support requires that EM hardening components, subsystems, and systems be evaluated and tested in both laboratory and field envir onments.  Additional support includes modifying existing hardening devices and developing and fabricating new hardening devises as needed.  Transportable Nuclear Reactor - A small light-weight transportable deployable nuclear reactor can be a very efficient source of electrical power for the U.S. Army. A nuclear reactor could have many logistical advantages in both tactical and/or strategic si tuations. Photon Quasi-pencil Beams - In flight of annihilation of relativistic positrons have been employed for years by nuclear physicists to produce extremely high frequency photonic pencil beams otherwise known as gamma ray pencil beams. The very high frequency annihilation results from the relativistic coordinate change from the center of mass to the Laboratory coordinate system.  These Highly Penetrating, High-Energy, quasi-mono-energetic (10 MeV, 1021 Hz) photon quasi-pencil beams can be employed for detection of ordnance, explosive waste, NBC agents and narcotics. 10 MeV Photons easily travel  much further than low energy gammas and easily penetrate metallic (Faraday cage) canisters.  Relativistic positrons are easily produced in electron linear accelerators by changing the phase by 180 degrees. Large electric fields inside of shielded enclosures can be generated by gamma radiation induced Compton currents.  This phenomenon has been defined as internal electromagnetic pulse (IEMP). The results of a concept study to generate a highly-directed, mono -energetic gamma burst from the in-flight annihilation of a relativistic positron source will be available.  The in flight annihilation of a relativistic positron source generates a quasi-pencil beam of high energy photons.  A photon energy (gamma ray) of 10 MeV has propagation characteristics in air, that will enable long standoff ranges (greater than 500m) for line-of-sight neutralization applications for the Army.  The long propagation distances of high energy gamma pencil beams and the vulnerability of modern off the shelf electronics to IEMP is to be investigated and exploited. Dose Rate Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Electronic Systems - Experimental data and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of total dose of pulsed ionizing radiation delivered in a short pulse is much more cost effective in disrupting an e lectronic system than a large dose delivered in the form of a long temporal pulse.  Compton current is proportional to the dose rate.  The electric field of IEMP is proportional to the second derivative of the total dose (V=L*dI/dt). Photovoltaic (PV) Power Sources - Involves using alternative energy sources in soldier applications.  To this end, PV battery materials and battery charging systems are expected to support the future warrior. Nuclear Batteries - The energy density of nuclear materials exceeds that of chemical materials by 6 orders of magnitude.  The potential use for long-lived sensor applications makes research into nuclear power sources, and materials for direct energy conver sion (DEC) a practical area of investigation. Small Engine Power Sources - Involves using small engines for soldier power applications.  The efficiency and power output levels are essential characteristics that must be optimized. Capacitor Technology and Power Electronics -.  The research includes development of experimental system design, experimental set-up, operation, and the evaluation and analysis of dielectric materials, capacitors, and pulse-forming networks along with devel opment of improved capacitors and pulse-forming networks for pulse power applications. This is a market survey/sources sought synopsis published for information only and shall not be construed as a request for competitive proposals or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government may proceed with a solicitation on the basis of this market survey/sources sought synopsis but under no circumstance will the U.S. Government otherwise pay for information solicited hereunder. Any Contract(s) awarded for these efforts will require the contractors personnel to have and main tain security clearance at the Secret Level.  Interested parties need to submit a written, detailed capabilities statement describing specific qualifications of personnel, proof of security clearances and demonstrated experience in performing any part (o r all) of the Governments needs in order for the Government to assess the type of set-aside (if any) under which the resultant solicitation will be issued.  NOTE:  The Government does not expect a full-blown technical proposal in response to this announce ment. However, in addition to the detailed capabilities statement, interested parties need to identify and certify to their business size based on NAICS code 541710, with a business size standard of 500 employees. The Government is considering all manner of set-asides up to and including full and open competition for this future requirement. The order of set-aside precede nce to determine if set-aside procedures will be used in announcing this future requirement will be based on the Governments expectation of at least two (2) responsive proposals in the following categories: 1.  8(a) Program: Competitive 8(a) Set-Aside (FAR 19.800(e))  2.

<DESC>The Army plans to privatize its transient lodging at substantially all of its installations throughout the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.  The Privatization of Army Lodging (PAL) office is responsible for accomplishing this goal.  Afte r lengthy deliberation, the Army has determined that the original strategy to use an LLC management structure (similar to that used under RCI (family housing)) is no longer in the best interest of the PAL program.    Consequently, the PAL office is conducting market research to gather input regarding strategies for implementation of lodging privatization that would maximize contributions to the capital improvement reserve account while still providing an acceptable lod ging product with room rates for official travelers that meet the requirement of an average rate not to exceed 75% of the lodging portion of per diem across the portfolio.   Previously, the PAL implementation strategy involved combining facilities at several installations into a series of project groups, each of which would have been offered under separate solicitations.  The PAL Office is now also evaluating the benefits of c onsolidating the entire program into a single solicitation.     The PAL office is interested in receiving your feedback regarding strategies for maximizing contributions to the PAL reinvestment account while providing a quality lodging product within the rate limitations noted above, as well as comments regarding the p ossibility of offering the entire program as a single project.   Responses received by the Army will be held in confidence.  Responses may be provided via e-mail or by scheduling a meeting with Mark Piedmonte, Contract Specialist, from the PAL office through the following e-mail address mark.piedmonte@hqda.army.mil.  In  order to continue progress on this initiative, please submit your responses no later than August 20, 2005.    Thank you for your continuing interest.

<SUBJECT>SPECIAL NOTICE -- NAVSEA WARFARE CENTERS SMALL BUSINESS WEB SITE
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. Small businesses are invited to visit the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Warfare Centers’ Small Business Web site where they may create profiles of their capabilities to support Warfare Center mission requirements.  This site is used by prospective customers, including government technical and acquisition personnel and large businesses, to become aware of capabilities in the small business sector and to identify new and competitive small business sources for needed supplies and services.  Unlike broader industry search tools, the business profiles created on this site are specific to the missions and requirements of the NAVSEA warfare centers.   Small Businesses that desire to create warfare center capability profiles and large businesses interested in using the site to identify small business subcontractors are invited to visit http://www.nswc.navy.mil/SBI/ to register.  A small business that is not familiar with NAVSEA warfare center requirements may preview them by clicking the Sample Registration link on this page to determine if registration is appropriate for that firm.  After registering, a small business will receive a password via e-mail and will then be able to log in and create a business profile.  Registered Government users and large businesses are able to create watch lists for the capabilities they seek in prospective small business contractors and subcontractors.   A recently added feature enables registered and profiled small businesses to maintain up to five active press releases on the site, in either MS Word or PDF format.  Along with capability profiles, information in press releases is also included in search queries. IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES:  The site contains specific guidance on creating small business capability profiles.  Small businesses are cautioned to follow this guidance very carefully.  The goal is to populate the Warfare Centers’ Small Business Web Site with accurate and realistic profiles in order to efficiently match the capabilities and competencies of the Small Business Sector with the specific needs of the warfare center customers. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI), although not small businesses per se, represent a special focus group for federal procurements.  HBCU/MI organizations having the capability to support NAVSEA warfare center requirements are invited to register as small businesses.  Questions or comments on the NAVSEA Warfare Center Small Business Web Site and its Small Business Tool may be submitted via the Feedback link on the site, or by email to DLGR_NSWC_Small_Biz@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Photogrammetric Analysis System Automation
<DESC>Photogrammetric Analysis System Automation Request For Information (RFI).

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) seeks information from potential commercial or academic sources with expertise in close range photogrammetry and/or computer vision that can automate NAWCAD’s photogrammetric analysis system. The system must perform pose recovery as quickly and reliably as possible with minimal human intervention, while maintaining or improving upon current system accuracy.

Currently, NAWCAD’s photogrammetry analysis system has two major applications.   In the store separation application, multiple high-speed cameras mounted on the aircraft are used to capture imagery of a store as it leaves the vicinity of the aircraft.  The image data is analyzed to produce a pose trajectory (or six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) trajectory), and this process is required to be completed within 1 hour, and to be accurate to within ½ inch and ½ degree in yaw and pitch, and 1 degree in roll.  In the ship suitability application, ground based cameras are used to capture imagery of aircraft catapults and landings to produce a pose trajectory. Due to a relatively simpler testing environment, NAWCAD requires that ship suitability results be produced in less than 2 minutes, and to be accurate to within 1 foot and 1 degree.

NAWCAD is now integrating data acquisition, pose analysis, and quality assurance processes into TrackEye, a motion analysis package made by Image Systems AB, of Linköping, Sweden, using their C++ based software development kit (SDK).  NAWCAD intends to integrate the selected solution into TrackEye using the SDK.  Interested parties should not feel required to have knowledge of TrackEye’s SDK, but the final product must be able to be integrated into TrackEye.    

The proposed solution could be based on current NAWCAD practices and provide improvements/automation to the target identification and tracking components of NAWCAD’s system. Alternatively, a solution could be proposed that revolutionizes the image analysis process, possibly altering the data acquisition process.  Any proposed methodology should be capable of dealing with target/object occlusion and reappearance, as well as vapor trails and other environmental factors that can degrade the quality of imagery.  

Interested parties can request an additional information packet that includes descriptions of NAWCAD’s photogrammetric processes for store separation and ship suitability, and a description of TrackEye and its SDK, by emailing the address shown below. A proposed method is not required to conform to NAWCAD’s current methods of photogrammetric data acquisition, so long as the proposed system can meet NAWCAD’s requirements for speed, reliability, accuracy, and integrability into TrackEye.  Interested parties can assume that computer models of the surfaces of aircraft and stores as well as intermediate camera and object pose results would be available for use in their proposed solutions.

Sources responding to this Request for Information (RFI) are to provide a written identification of proposed solutions via email at the address shown below. Written response requirements should include, at a minimum:

1.	A description of the proposed solution.
2.	Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost statement that identifies anticipated costs associated with requirements analysis, design, development and testing.
3.	Description of the source’s organization, highlighting their capability to perform the proposed task.

This RFI is issued in an effort to conduct market research in a timely manner to assist in the strategic planning of the NAWCAD’s Photogrammetrics Team.


THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential, solutions and products prior to determining the method of acquisition. A formal solicitation may not necessarily result from any or all items identified in this RFI.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  However, information received as a result of this RFI may be reflected in a formal solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website, located at www.fedbizops.gov.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this cite for the releases of any follow-on information.  This is a RFI and feedback from industry is sought for our requirements as stated in this synopsis. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to the RFI; nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided. In addition to the minimum response requirements outlined above, reponses to this RFI may include the following: (1) Comments/suggestions on the specification and overall contract approach (2) Comments on responders commerciality of its hardware. 

Information is requested in writing by 19 August 2005.  The ROM will be used for budgetary planning purposes only. As such, it is requested that the ROM be provided by 01 August 2005.  Interested sources are highly encouraged to submit an information package as well as any questions, comments or suggestion by mail to: Contracts, Attn: Darlene M.

A)	Technical capability to meet the Government Requirement B)	Past Performance C)	Price Note, do these factors and language (from GovWorks GSA eval) apply to your solicitation, if not adjust them accordingly. Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Vendors will be shown examples of various scenarios of improper payments to aid them in their understanding of the problem. At this time Livanta LLC expects to provide vendors with three data files. The first file will contain known Medicare improper payments that vendors can use to apply their data mining and data analysis tool(s) against to identify predictors of improper payments. The second data file will comprise of known improper payments and correct payments so that vendors can test their data mining tools against the data to ensure they only detect improper payments. Lastly, vendors will be provided a new data file comprising improper payments and correct error payments. Vendors will be allowed thirty days to apply their data mining and data analysis tool(s) to Medicare data to detect the anomalies. On a date to be determined later, vendors will be invited to Livanta LLC, 9090 Junction Drive, Suite 9, Annapolis Junction, Maryland 20701 and be allowed two hours to demonstrate their data mining and data analysis tool and/or service for identifying and detecting Medicare improper payments.

Livanta LLC will award a contract to the successful vendor for their product and/or service. Vendors are expected to work directly with Livanta LLC (a government contractor) on this solicitation and not a government agency.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for HSCG85-05-Q-625749 is CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is total small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance experience will be evaluated.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  The Coast Guard has a requirement to procure the following items for the TEMPORARY BERTHING & MESSING of the USCGC STEADFAST (WMEC 623) crew during the period of 11 August 2005 through 01 September 2005.

<DESC>A question has been asked regarding the aforementioned solicitation. 

Question and answer is as follows:

Question 1.  What is the anticipated performance period for this contract?

Answer 1.  The period of performance is one (1) year from the date of award.







This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50052-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to provide literature review, interviews and site visits.  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients whose cancer care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.  The overall objective of the work is to identify barriers and facilitators of high quality cancer care; and identify innovative ideas for safer, and more effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable cancer care in the United States; including potential gains in each area from clinical information systems.  The contractor shall conduct a literature review (both peer-reviewed and “grey” literature) on the quality of cancer care; semi-structured individual and group discussions; and site visits to a selected set of cancer care service delivery organizations.  The purpose of the semi-structured discussions with key leaders and practicing clinicians and of the site visits to a variety of oncology settings is to learn from clinicians, senior leadership, health care experts, and patients about their views, gather information for improvement including innovations in care, safety-related issues, barriers to high quality care, and ideas for change, even if not already implemented.  The results of this work will inform future projects intended to design and implement systems to improve cancer care services.   The contractor shall synthesize finding of the literature review, discussions, and the site visits and present the findings and conclusions to the government for its use in designing cancer care prototypes. 

Statement of Work:

Technical Requirements:  A) The contractor shall submit a plan of work in the form of a Gantt chart with dates for each milestone and annotations for each milestone that includes personnel effort and other resources to be used;  B)  Capture and summarize what is known about cancer care quality through (A) review of published and “gray literature” on cancer care quality.  Review the published peer reviewed and non peer reviewed literature in commonly used databases (e.g., PubMed, nursing, health services) and summarize the findings as a literature review with complete citations with a particular emphasis on the period of cancer care from initial suspicion through diagnosis and plan of treatment.  The contractor shall acquire and review relevant articles and relevant references in those papers and search for and gather “grey” literature (e.g., reports and position papers by commissions; papers and websites of professional, health system or health plan, and advocacy organizations) on cancer care quality.  The contractor shall summarize findings of the literature review and provide copies of the relevant references.  An electronic draft of the summary shall be made available to the government for review and comment.  C)  Interview health policy experts, senior leadership and researchers.

<DESC>This amendment answers questions posed by vendors (who submitted them by the Wednesday, July 20, 2005 deadline listed in the combined synopsis/solicitation).  The questions and answers are below.  Due to the need to make award in a timely fashion, no more questions can be answered.  Accordingly, quotations should be made based on the original solicitation and this amendment.   
 
1)  How many interpreters will be required?    About 8 total. It depends upon the event. Generally, it is for one or two people in the office. 
 
2)  Will it be required to have one interpreter per employee for 20 hours per week?     The same interpreter is not required to be in the office for the entire time.
 
3)  Will there be set hours for the interpreter(s)?    We anticipate a 40 hours/week work week. Generally, it is 8-5 [with an hour for lunch], but with special events, that may vary.
 
4) The soliciation notifies multiple awards. Will each award be similar? Is there a description for each award?      Each award will be for the same services.

5)  Is there an agency currently providing sign language interpretering services?  If so, is it possible to know which agency provides the services?     We have several agencies providing these services right now.  Releasing such names would not affect quotes and thus do not need to be provided.  
 
6) Is there any knowledge at this time of a future location for DHS? If so, will the location be metro accessible?    No knowledge available, for either question.  

7.  Will DHS sponsor secret security clearances? Since the whole process takes more than 75 days.     DHS will turn in and follow the paperwork for clearances, but it is each company’s responsibility to be able to manage their own clearance process.

8. Does DHS intend to ask the approved vendors to compete for every task order it will issue under this BPA?    No. Generally, we define a process for using the approved vendors.

9. How many companies do you expect to be providing these services?     Minimum 3-4

10. Who is the incumbent?     See answer #5 above.

11. What is the typical duration of the interpretation jobs?       These are for continued services. We'll need people to support deaf employees of the department on a daily basis as well as special events.

12. Are there any limitations--will travel and parking expenses be paid if a project should last for less than 2 hours in any one day?     Yes, travel and parking would be reimbursed in such a case. 

13. What is your policy on paying two interpreters for the same project? (It is standard practice among interpreters to work in teams of two, to provide each other with adequate rest and to assure the quality of their work, with both being paid?).       
       This will depend upon the circumstances and needs. At times, two interpreters will definitely be needed, but at other times, one is enough.
