<DESC>This combined sources sought/synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A contract may not be awarded as a result of this combined sources sought/synopsis. The US Army Contracting Agency, Contracting Center of Excellence on behalf of the Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operations Center, intends to procure escort and facilitator services as a small business and or hub-zone set-aside or under full and open procedures. The capability package for this sources sought market survey is not expected to be a proposal, but rather statements regarding the company's existing experience in relation to the areas specified in the PWS.  Only small businesses and hub-zone businesses are to submit capability packages. Interested small and hub-zone businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business or hub-zone business concern in NAICS code 812990 with a size standard of $7 Million are encouraged to submit their capability packages.  Capability packages must not exceed 50 pages and must be submitted electronically.  Small business and hub-zone businesses are to outline their experiences in the following areas:  Facilitation services, escort services, hospital liaison services, family assistance, meeting and greeting family members upon arrival at airport, and assisting family members arriving and departing from the bedside of wounded soldiers.  Areas or tasks where a contractor does not have prior experience should be annotated as such.  NOTE:  The following questions must be addressed in each capability package.  1. Financial Capability-Does your firm have the financial capability to withstand a negative cash flow? 2. Past Performance- Does your firm have the relevant past performance within the last three years (include contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, point of contacts, and brief description of the work performed)? 3. Corporate Experience-Does your firm have the work experience similar in nature, scope, complexity and difficulty of work as outlined above? If at least two responsible small and or hub-zone business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of the capability packages submitted by April 6, 2009, the requirement will be solicited as a 100% set-aside for small and or hub-zone business concerns. If capability packages are not received from at least two responsible small business or hub-zone businesses by the response date or if the Government determines that no small or hub-zone businesses are capable of performing this requirement based upon an evaluation of the capability packages submitted, this requirement will be solicited under full and open procedures.  To assist us in maintaining a list of interested small and hub-zone businesses for this potential procurement, please provide your company's name, point of contact (POC), address, phone number, and business size under the above NAICS code to the POC for this procurement (Toye Latimore, Contracting Officer, Email:  toye.y.latimore@us.army.mil).

BACKGROUND

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector. The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity. The NLRB has two principal functions: (1) to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and (2) to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions. The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 53 Regional, Subregional, or Resident Offices.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this request is to lease a car to be used as the Agencys primary method of transportation for the five Board Members, General Counsel, and other Agency officials in the conduct of official Agency business.

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information include in this notice.

BACKGROUND

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector. The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity. The NLRB has two principal functions: (1) to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and (2) to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions. The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 53 Regional, Subregional, or Resident Offices.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this request is to lease a car to be used as the Agencys primary method of transportation for the five Board Members, General Counsel, and other Agency officials in the conduct of official Agency business.

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
