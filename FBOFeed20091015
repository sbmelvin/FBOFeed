<DESC>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), contemplates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to United Launch Services, L.L.C., for additional EELV Launch Capability (ELC) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, with options for FY 2012. The ELC support includes requirements for program management, systems engineering, factory support, training, launch vehicle transportation, launch operations, mission integration, mission assurance, and mission-unique design efforts. The RFP will be issued no sooner than 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). The Government may elect not to award any ELC effort (described above) as a result of the solicitation. FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) states, "Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization." A Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) may permit Government ELC support to be awarded with less than full and open competition to United Launch Services, L.L.C., consistent with the Competition in Contracting Act. The LRSW has developed a New Entrant Evaluation Plan (NEEP) defining a structured approach by which the Wing will evaluate the ability of a potential new entrant to meet EELV program requirements including launch vehicles and supporting launch capability infrastructure support, hereafter referred to as launch services. A "new entrant" is any contractor other than current providers of EELV launch services. The evaluation plan identifies the business and technical requirements for a new entrant to be eligible for award of launch services. A business evaluation will determine the responsibility of the new entrant, including financial resources, organization and functional expertise, adequacy of production and launch operations facilities, and the ability to obtain necessary construction and environmental permits. A technical evaluation will determine the new entrant's understanding of, and ability to meet, EELV systems requirements, design maturity, adequacy of development and qualification activities, manufacturing process quality, and demonstrated system flight worthiness. The result of the new entrant evaluation process will be a formal determination by the Commander, LRSW, submitted to and approved by the Commander, Space and Missile Center, regarding the ability of the new entrant to compete for EELV launch services. The intent of this plan is to ensure new entrants are provided an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities (at their own expense), while protecting the Government's need to acquire systems that meet requirements. The capability required to provide ELC requires the same expertise and experience required to provide EELV launch services. Any interested parties or new entrants may contact the Contracting Officer (address below) to request a copy of the NEEP. Responses from Small Businesses are encouraged. The NAICS Code is 336414, and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. Interested parties (or new entrants) must be: (1) U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal; (2) have successfully demonstrated two missions (intermediate or larger) that inserted payloads into their intended orbits; (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) as presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3; and (4) successfully completed the new entrant evaluation criteria (described above), at their own expense. Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services, including ELC, are encouraged to submit a Statement of Capability and qualifications (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to: LRSW/PK, 483 N Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245, Attn: Charles Briggs. Prior EELV experience has shown that the new entrant certification time period may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the effort identified in this NOCA. Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and the described New Entrant Evaluation Plan to initiate activity towards qualifying their launch system for future EELV launch services. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor otherwise pay for the information requested herein.

<DESC>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps or FBO) system, vendors must:

  Be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  

  Verify your CCR registration within the FBO system
    o  Once logged into the FBO system, go to the MyProfile tab  
    o  Click on the Company Information sub-tab
    o  Click on the Register DUNS button
    o  Enter DUNS number and select Proceed and Review

  Once registered, go to the FBO website and log in.  Click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form.  Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U. S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form within 5 days of receipt.  Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.  Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.
   o  The CS/Vendors can check the following website to ensure their JCP status:   http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/search.aspx

  Once you receive the MPIN, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.  The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. 
    o  The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FedBizOpps.
    o  How to Look up an MPIN 
       &#61607;  Go to the CCR Homepage: www.ccr.gov
       &#61607;  Enter the user ID and password, then click the "Log In" button. 
       &#61607;  Select "View" across from the DUNS number you are looking for. 
       &#61607;  Scroll to the bottom of the Points of Contact to view the associated MPIN.  

  Following verification of the MPIN, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the Request Explicit Access button.  Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DESC personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system.  Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DESC.  
    o  If a request for explicit access was previously submitted, and is pending review, the vendor will see a designation that explicit access was previously submitted.
    o  If a request for explicit access was previously submitted, and granted, the vendor will see designation that explicit access was previously granted.
    o  If you have not received notification from the FBO system that you have received explicit access, please contact the POCs assigned to the procurement you are interested in.  

  Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.  



Some important notes to keep in mind:

Vendors MUST allow sufficient time for the submission and processing of the DD2345 request.  Requests for extension of closing/due dates based upon lack of access to secured documents will not generally be considered without evidence of timely DD2345 submission.  

DLIS does not correlate a particular DD2345 to a specific procurement or to DESC.  Your DLIS certification will be valid until the expiration date listed in block 7c of the DD2345, and can be used for any procurement in the FBO system.  

For any additional questions, there is a user guide for vendors located under the Getting Started tab of the FBO website.  Information regarding access to secured documents can be found starting on page 44 of the Vendor user guide.

<CONTACT>John  S  Hunt, Contract Specialist , Phone (720) 963-3352, Fax 720-963-3360, Email john.hunt@dot.gov
<DESC>PROJECT DETAILS:  The project (AZ PRA GRCA 12(7)) is located at the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. The project extends from about 0.5 miles east and west of Mather Point and south of the existing service road at Canyon View Information Plaza (CVIP).  

This project is for the improvements to the Canyon View Information Plaza and the Mather Point overlook at Grand Canyon National Park.  This is the second phase of work and is the architectural side of the proposed improvements.  This phase will require construction of a landmark feature, amphitheater, and restroom, shuttle bus stop (one at Mather Point and two at Park Headquarters) and Mather Point overlook improvements.   The contractor for this project will be required to incorporate boulders and rocks consistent with the total overall theme for the Mather Point area.  

Principle work items include:  Concrete pavement 3,600 square yards; concrete sidewalk 4,000 square yards; asphalt trail 3,000 square yards; roadway excavation 3,000 cubic yards; handrail installation 1,600 linear feet; boulder placement 350 each; rockery features 1,000 cubic yards; stone masonry features 250 square yards.  This project contains one schedule and one option.  The option is for the Mather Point improvements.  

The work includes architectural columns to link the pavilion area and the shuttle bus plaza. The Visitor Center shuttle bus improvements will be built as a special feature since the area is a key component for visitors arrival to the area and their overall experience.  The contractor for this project will be required to work with the sculptor in the placement of the stones for both the Landmark Feature and the Amphitheater.  The contractor for this project will be required to place specific signature boulders to develop the appropriate design character.  

The Mather Point improvements will consist of reconstruction of the concrete walking stair in its current location and will include new hand railings.  A major element of this construction will be providing an accessible trail that begins on the western edge and ramps down toward the observation point.  Stone walls and railings will be required along the ramp access to the point.    The contractor for this project will be required to bring the overlook surface up to ABAAS standards without degrading the natural Kaibab limestone bedrock and maintaining the integrity of the experience for the visitor. 

The amphitheater will be constructed to accommodate approximately 50 to 80 people.  The structure for the amphitheater will consist of an earth and fill faced with large boulders that serve as character elements and seating.

Tentative advertisement date is November 4, 2009.  
 
PLEASE NOTE:   The Request for Proposals will be available for download after November 4, 2009, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.

                                           DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK

PROJECT TITLE: Access to Elseviers Science Direct On-Line Services

I.	Statement of Work

A.	Background Information
For the past eleven years, the NIH Library has provided access to over 1300 journals in a wide range of scientific, technical and medical subjects through its contract with Elsevier for Science Direct. For the past five years, the contract also included access and use rights to the Scopus and EMBASE databases, online reference works, and hundreds of online books published or produced by Elsevier. Each year well over two million articles are downloaded from Science Direct by NIH researchers and hundreds of thousands of searches are conducted on the databases. Links from PubMed, Web of Science the Elsevier databases, and the NIH Library website allows NIH staff to connect directly to the articles in Science Direct following a search of the various sites. Science Direct and the other resources included in this contract allows DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators. Feedback from NIH and HHS researchers, clinicians and administrators  indicates that the easy accessibility of needed information made possible by providing electronic access to Elsevier  journals and the Scopus and Embase database through its Science Direct platform has increased their productive work time, because of the time saved identifying and retrieving relevant articles.

B.	Objectives

The specific objective of this requirement requires the contractor to continue to provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Elsevier journals, including Cell Press titles, through its web interface Science Direct.  Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Science Direct platform. The contractor is also required to continue to provide access to other databases and journals as outlined under the specific requirements section of this SOW.


II.	Services to be performed

A.	General Requirements
1.	Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment and facilities needed to perform the Statement of Work below.

2.	All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer.
B.	Specific Requirements
Specifically, the contractor shall:
1.	Provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Elsevier journals, including Cell Press titles, through its web interface Science Direct.

2.	The contractor shall also provide options for continued unlimited access to Scopus for NIH and HHS staff, continued unlimited access to Embase for NIH staff, and the option of adding access to the Reaxys database for a select group of NIH researchers, primarily chemists.

3.	The contractor also shall provide options for acquiring e-books, online reference works, and backfiles of selected journals (journal articles published prior to 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Science Direct platform).

4.	The contractor shall provide an option for DLS to add new titles as the contractor adds to its holdings through acquisition or publication of a new title. The contractor also shall provide an option for DLS to cancel selected journal titles should its funding be reduced.

C.	Government Responsibilities

1.	The Government will be responsible for providing an interface via web links for the NIH community to access the Elsevier Science Direct website.
2.	NIH will be responsible for creating a system to validate security for entrance into the website.
3.	Upon signature by the Government, the contractor license agreement will be incorporated into the contract.
D.	Reporting Requirements and Deliverables
1.	The contractor shall regularly provide the Project Officer with monthly usage statistics for individual journal titles as well as aggregated use data for journals and databases. 

2.	Monthly use data shall be broken out separately for NIH and for  the individual HHS agencies served by the NIH Library/DLS.

3.	 Use by selected NIH institutes may also be required when that use is identifiable, e.g. from IP range or log in.

The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Goodrich Corporation and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government's requirements.  The Government does not possess the Level III drawing package, specifications, test procedures, and test benches to allow for full and open competition.  The repairs/procurements are unique to the C-130J and derivative Type Model Series (T/M/S) aircraft and must integrate precisely with existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility. 
POC for information regarding this requirement is Pamela Ryan, telephone 812-854-5703 or email pamela.d.ryan@navy.mil; e-mail request is preferred.  This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Goodrich Corp. in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<a href="mailto:Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov">NICOLE MODAFARI</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research & Development (ORD) is seeking contractor support on a requirement entitled (Recovery & Reuse of Metals from Mining Influenced Water).  This requirement involves removing metals from mining influenced water in a form that would allow for reuse.  The Rocky Mountains host thousands of abandoned mines with exposed metals-laden rock.  Interaction of water with these rocks has resulted in acidic rock drainage and other environmental problems, including the potential for severe damage to the aquatic ecosystems posing a potential threat to human health.   Water treatment facilities are in use in this region to extract heavy metals such that water will not cause further problems downstream.  However, these treatment facilities are expensive and generate large quantities of sludge resulting in additional mining activities to acquire these metals for new production.
The purpose of this regional applied research effort (RARE) is to address the challenges of removing metals from mining influenced water in a form that would allow for reuse of the metals thus reducing operations and maintenance costs at the mines by decreasing the volume of sludge requiring disposal.  RARE projects include a research component for this study with modifications to an existing technology to meet the goals/objectives.  Water chemistry parameters (pH, alkalinity (low), hardness (high), ionic strength (generally high), temperature (high altitude locations), and rapid precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides) vary in mining-influenced watersheds, possibly causing an existing technology to require these alterations.  While non-alkaline-chemical treatment technologies exist for removal of metals from mining-influenced water, few field implementations are known for the use of treating acid-mine drainage water for reuse.  
The EPA is seeking a contractor to (1) use existing technology in a 5-6 month field pilot study to attain a reduction in waste sludge of at least 30% with a 95-99% recovery efficiency at or below water standards, (2) make the technology pilot ready within the first 6 months of the project start date, (3) implement a proven remote monitoring system, and (4) find a smelter that will accept the material created for recovery and reuse of the metals.  
The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to span a 2 year duration.  We anticipate that the solicitation will be posted for 30 days beginning in November.   The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis, with no small business set-aside.  A copy of the solicitation will be available at the following location: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.  The point of contact is Nicole Modafari, Contract Specialist, at 513-487-2001, Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov.   See Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

a listing of enhancements for the 2009-2010 Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) plan for the Aviation Environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT) Partial Equilibrium Bock (PEB).  The plan for these enhancements must be established before February 2010. 
The primary focus of the program is to develop a new capability to assess the interdependencies between aviation-related noise, emissions, and fuel burn, and to provide comprehensive impact and cost and benefit analyses to inform aviation environmental policy decisions.  The three main building blocks of the tool suite are:  1. Environmental Design Space (EDS) develops performance, noise, fuel burn, and emissions characteristics for aircraft; 2. Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) comprises the integration of both existing and original aviation noise and emissions analytical modules to provide an integrated capability to assess interrelationships between noise, emissions, and fuel burn across study scales from a single airport to world-wide; 3. Aviation Environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT) applies economic, environmental response, and valuation modules based on information provided by AEDT and EDS to evaluate common, transparent cost/benefit methodologies for coordinated aviation and environmental policy development.  The main focus is the development of the APMT Partial Equilibrium Block (PEB), a component within the APMT.  Development of the PEB will greatly enhance APMT modeling and impact analysis capability.  A complete statement of work will be set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).  RFQ issuance will be on or about October 29, 2009.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Western Region Geospatial Information Office and Hawaiian field offices intend to make a non-competitive award to Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. (HT) of Honolulu, Hawaii for technology that supports interisland connectivity using virtual LAN technology by establishing Ethernet connections to two additional Hawaiian office locations in accordance with FAR 13.501(a).  These locations include UH Manoa Keller Hall in Honolulu, Hawaii and MHPCC on Lipoa Parkway in Kihei, Maui, Hawaii.  USGS has the need to upgrade their existing HT network services from frame relay to Ethernet over MPLS at 25 Mbps data rates.  Additionally, the vendor will provide 5 VLAN IDs, 3 IDs to the UH Keller Hall location and 2 IDs to the MHPCC location.  Since HT is the only Local Exchange Carrier (LEC), only they can provide this upgrade.  Once the upgrade has been completed, the USGS will require the enhanced IP Data Service (25 Mbps) for one base year and four option years at these two Hawaiian locations.
Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. is the only provider that can provide VPLS to all of the following locations and is the only provider that has the infrastructure and services to connect the following USGS locations in Hawaii:  (1) 677 Ala Moana, Honolulu, (2) Hawaii Volcano Observatory, Volcano National Park, (3) Cell Site, Volcano National Park, (4) 2565 McCarthy Mall, Honolulu, (5) 590B Lipoa Parkway, Kihei, (6) 360 Hoohano Street, Kahului, and (7) 4398 D Pua Loke Street, Lihue.  
The Request for Quotations (RFQ), number 10WRQQ0006, will be made available through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about 22 October 2009, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 5.102(a)(1), FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD), is conducting a sources sought FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY to determine whether small socioeconomic business capabilities exist to support this requirement.
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is applicable to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (covering 15% of the need), code 541513 - Computer Facilities Management Services or code 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services (covering 85% of the need) and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 8999; and size standard $7 Million. EPA is in search of small socioeconomic businesses (such as 8(a), HUB Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs)) to provide Enforcement Support Services for Enforcement and Information (E & I) activities in the following major areas: Community Relations, Enforcement, Administrative Records, Freedom of Information Act Response, Superfund Records and Documents, and Special Projects; for the Superfund Programs of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regions 5 (Chicago, IL) and 6 (Dallas, TX).  
The services to be provided shall be in accordance with all environmental statutes as appropriate.  A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be posted on the EPA HQ website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm.
Interested parties must possess the experience and capabilities to provide Enforcement Support Services for the Enforcement and Information (E & I) activities listed above and to provide (1) Progress Reports for Monitoring Costs and Progress of Work; (2) Task Order Work Plans; (3) Project Reports; and (4) Cost Recovery Documentation.  The Contractor shall perform in accordance with all applicable guidance, regulation, and law.  The contractor must be familiar with all U.S. environmental statutes (e.g., Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA),  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), or successor statutes), but must possess particular, demonstrable knowledge of the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by the  Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the Small Business Relief and Brownfield Revitalization Act ("Brownfield's Amendments"), as well as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements.  	Successful completion of enforcement activities at Superfund sites requires close coordination of these activities in concert with other site events.  The pace of enforcement activities is often dictated by removal actions, mandatory notice to Potential Responsible Parties (PRPs), public comment periods, and statutes of limitation (SOL).  Each of the enforcement support activities listed in this PWS is interrelated with and dependent upon the others.  Site complexities such as divisible harm, multiple operable units, and both cooperative and recalcitrant PRPs at the same site make it difficult to delineate the end of one enforcement activity and the beginning of another.  Enforcement should be considered an ongoing process rather than a discrete event.  Each activity has a direct bearing on the others, and successful performance of each activity is essential to the successful completion of all activities.  Therefore, in order to competently provide support in the following major areas of Community Relations, Enforcement, Administrative Records, Freedom of Information Act Response, Superfund Records and Documents, and Special Projects, the contractor must be capable - in terms of knowledge, experience and personnel - to provide support for them all.	The Agency's responsibility to the public requires the creation and maintenance of records which document every type of Superfund activity and the cost of those activities. These records, regardless of media, must be preserved to ensure their integrity and their availability during the site life cycle for the site and beyond.  This contract entails support of the Agency to accomplish these dual missions of preservation and production.  All aspects of the Superfund Program require records management characterized by efficiency, efficaciousness, and excellence.
Interested parties shall provide all of the following information:  (1) business name, address, telephone number and business site and socioeconomic category for NAICS code 541620, 541513 and 541611; (2) a concise capability statement showing that your firm is qualified to perform the above mentioned tasks, limiting the response to no more than five (5) double sided pages. Capability statements should respond to all items requested herein to allow for an accurate business assessment. Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the PWS will not be considered as a sufficient response to this notice; (3) a list of current and past contracts with similar requirements not to exceed 1 page. 
Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements. Telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be not be accepted or acknowledged. All responses should be sent via the e-mail link provided in the section entitled point of contact(s) listed below.
Firms shall ensure responses are documented to the extent the Government can determine the firms qualifications to perform this requirement. If it is determined that there are not enough firms of a specific category such as 8(a), HUB Zone or SDVOSBs to ensure adequate competition, this procurement will be set-aside for small business. This sources sought does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this sources sought announcement or otherwise pay for any information or inquiry. 
Interested concerns who believe they have the capability of providing the required services as defined in the performance work statement are invited to submit a Capabilities Statement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought    A.	General Information.  The Southeast Region (Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of HAND SANITIZERS.  The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to, Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is February 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast region, the government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Points of Contact: Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of HAND SANITIZERS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $391,459.32.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.  At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process. <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified in Phase I or Phase II will be notified in writing (via email) at the conclusion of the evaluation process which is DSCP approval and the signing of the agreement by the final authority.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions / quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to VIRGINIA.SLAYTON@US.ARMY.MIL by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:    <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Hand Sanitizers products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum the vendor MUST provide the following types and sizes of Hand Sanitizers:  Instant, Waterless/No-Rinse, with or without a moisturizing base, in liquid/gel and foam formulas in the following sizes/forms  Liquids 2 to 3 Ounces, 1000 to 2000 Milliliters, 2 Liters: Gels- 8 Ounces: and Foams- 15 Ounces, 750 Milliliters.

Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the complete Hand Sanitizers product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>5.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the Med/Surg prime vendor in the Southeast Region for Hand Sanitizers (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor).  Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Note vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>7.	Vendors MUST submit Hand Sanitizers with an alcohol content of between 60%-95% [per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, October 2002].  Vendor MUST submit documentation on Liquids/Gels and Foams to support the alcohol base content in response to this RFRIAQ.  Note: Vendors who do not provide documentation will be disqualified in Phase I. <BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO point of contact and will be allowed fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO location by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.<BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP final approval).<BR>Vendor will provide no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation.  Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  (Unused samples will not be returned).  The TRBO will notify all qualified/invited vendors of their products arrival.  Vendors WILL NOT need to require signature to verify delivery. Vendors WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.  <BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers)  Hand Sanitizer products dispense amount effortlessly without repeated attempts, clogging, or dripping from the dispensing nozzle/flip top.  <BR>a.	Obtaining adherence of healthcare workers to use Hand Sanitizers is critical in the reduction of risks of health care-associated infections and it is important to have easy to use products.<BR>b.	The evaluator will open the Hand Sanitizer product and during dispensing monitor the tip for potential clogging and/or dripping from the nozzle/flip top. <BR>2.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers)  Hand Sanitizer product absorbs easily and quickly (less than 30 seconds).  <BR>a.	Hand Sanitizer products that do not absorb easily and quickly are more apt not to be utilized by Healthcare Workers thus increasing the risk of health care-associated infections.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will put the manufactured required amount of product on hand and then rubbing hands together for 30 seconds, observes hands for drying of product.  <BR>3.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers) -  Hand Sanitizers do not leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue build- up on the skin after absorption.<BR>a.	Hand Sanitizer products that leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue on the hands are not only less likely to be used but also have the potential to interfere with glove usage and decreasing the efficiency of the gloves.  <BR>b.	As the evaluator rubs their hands together during usage, the evaluator will observe the hands for any greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue build up on the skin after absorption.    <BR>4.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers) - Hand Sanitizers product leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and non-irritated (not dry, cracked, chafed or irritated).<BR>a.	Hand Sanitizer products that leave the hand feeling dry, cracked, chafed or irritated are less likely to be utilized and thus increasing the risk of health care-associated infections.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will observe the hands 30 seconds after usage and observe hands for drying, cracking, chaffing or irritation of the skin.  <BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.	  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) period from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor and (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 06 NOVEMBER 2009 5:00 PM EST.<BR>

Box 5943 , New York, New York, 10087-5943, for annual preventive maintenance, including parts, labor, travel expenses, and one preventive maintenance inspection of the following: 1) Axio Observer D2, SN: 3833000222, and accessories, including AxioCam HRc Rev.2 and Zeiss 29D with axiocam or AV; 2) Axiovert 200M Motorized, SN: 3820001663, and accessories, including AxioCam HRc Rev.2 with 3.3V interface, AxioCam MRm Rev.2, Zeiss Imaging with s 25A High End, and Motorized Scanning Stage; 3) Stereo Discovery V12 Microscope Body, SN: 3912001152, and accessories, including AxioCam HRc Rev.2 and Zeiss 29D WS with Axiocam or AV; 4) Pascal with one microscope, SN: 1209000207. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy the Agency's requirements because this is the only service that can meet the requirements for preventive maintenance because anyone other than Zeiss authorized personnel attempting to repair or service the eequipment would exclude Zeiss from their obligations. No solicitation is being issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which, if received by the response date, shall be considered by the Agency. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the Government. For contractual questions, contact Tiffney Griner-Esslinger @ tesslinger@cdc.gov.

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items:
One, Tetrad 2 Thermal Cycler Chassis.  Four bay thermal cycler chassis, does not include Alpha unit reaction modules (requires 4).
Four, 96-Well Alpha Unit with Hot Bonnet Heated Lid.  96-well reaction module for DNA Engine Thermal Cyclers, holds one 96 -well plate or 96 x .02 ml tubes, includes sample consumables.
Four, 48/48 Dual Alpha Unit with two Heated Lids.  Reaction module for DNA Engine thermal cycles, includes 2 independent blocks, each holds 48 x 0.2 ml tubes, also includes sample consumables.
Vendor:
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.2000 Alfred Nobel Dr.Hercules, CA 94547-1804
Central to the work of the Genetics Section are the procedures, instruments, and reagents used for DNA sequence analysis and STR fragment analysis.  The use of validated protocols and instruments and the ability to maintain consistency between procedures is crucial to forensic genetic analyses.  The DNA Engine Tetrad Thermal Cycler with 4 x 96-well independent "hot-bonnet" heated lids offered by Bio-Rad is a replacement for an existing DNA Engine Tetrad Thermal Cycler.  The 4x Dual-48 "hot bonnet" heads are interchangeable only with the Tetrad 2 base unit.  These heads, however can be interchanged between an existing Tetrad 2 in use in the Genetics Laboratory, as well as with a new Tetrad 2.  The acquisition of these multi-use heads will help increase efficiency of PCR use for small volume casework.  PCR procedures and protocols used in forensic casework have been validated for use on a peltier thermal cycler.  Purchase of the Bio-Rad DNA Engine Tetrad Thermal Cycler will allow the genetics section to maintain workflow in support of the FWS/OLE mission without spending additional time and effort to validate PCR protocols on a machine with different thermal parameters.  
Bio-Rad is the original manufacturer and sole supplier of the DNA Engine Tetrad Thermal Cycler.  The Genetics section requires an instrument that will provide an interchangeable platform with an existing DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycler must be capable of independent programming of 4 96-well heads with heated lids, and must e able to accommodate dual 48-well heads.  The unit must have an integrated power supply with power supply protection in which programs resume execution upon power-up if the power fails.  The unit must include a graphical gradient calculator for gradient temperature protocols and must allow a temperature range of 0 degrees C - 100 degrees C.  Thermal accuracy of the unit must be NIST traceable, and within 0.3 degrees C within 30 seconds of arrival at 90 degrees C; and a thermal homogeneity of 0.4 degrees C within 30 sec of arrival at 90 degrees C.

<DESC>EC10Notice Type: Special Notice For Informational Purposes OnlySynopsis: This announcement is for the Empire Challenge 2010 (EC10) Event scheduled for live execution in September 2010. Empire Challenge is an Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) sponsored, U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) executed joint/combined Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) interoperability demonstration.  EC10 will focus on improving the ability of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Afghanistan to effectively and efficiently manage, access and use ISR to improve command and control (C2), and enhancing information sharing and situational understanding to improve the effectiveness of operations while minimizing collateral damage in a complex environment.  
This announcement is not a request for proposal; no contract award shall be made as a result of this announcement.  EC10 Points of Contact are: John Kittle at (757) 836-0288 or Rodney Brickell at (757) 836-0287.
Added:  Empire Challenge 2010
1. Event DescriptionThis announcement is for Empire Challenge 2010 (EC10) scheduled for live execution in September 2010. EC10 will consist of a series of ISR interoperability events using a combination of modeling & simulation, laboratory and live-fly events to provide solutions-based assessments of the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Enterprise, as well as multinational, multi-INT, capability based interoperability, Intel-Ops Fusion capabilities.   
EC10 will simulate elements of the ISAF command structure with an emphasis at the Regional Command (RC)-level and below in an operationally representative, "live-fly" environment augmented by virtual and constructive capabilities. 
2. Joint Capability Threads and Objectives   EC10 Joint Capability Threads (JCTs) are supported by associated objectives developed at the Concept Development Conference (CDC), based on inputs from USD/(I), Joint Staff J2, CENTCOM and SOCOM, the Services and Defense (DoD) Agencies, and the Coalition Community.  The JCTs and baseline objectives reflect the following themes:a. C2 - ISR Data Integration to Support Operations in a Complex Environment1) Integrate CI/HUMINT Tools and data with the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Enterprise and C2 architecture, and make accessible by multinational forces in a timely manner.2) Provide interoperable Unattended Ground Sensor (UGS) data with DCGS Enterprise and C2 architecture, and make accessible to multinational forces.3) Enable interoperability between the DCGS Enterprise and ISAF C2 networks to pass ISR data and receive operational reporting.4) Integrate ISR (assets, collection & tracks) and C2 tracks for display on C2 and ISR operational and tactical displays.5) Properly tag ISR and operational data to enable data sharing across multiple security domains, and between US and ISAF networks.b. C2 and ISR Management to Achieve Persistent Surveillance Over Key Terrain1) Refine collection and Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) management doctrine and tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs) to enable tasking of ISAF ISR assets, providing persistent surveillance over key terrain for a specified period.2) Manage, store and disseminate large persistent data sets to the DCGS Enterprise and warfighter at the tactical edge.3) Automate/assist in the processing of persistent surveillance data to alert operators to potential targets of interest.4) Integrate multi-INT sensors and processing, exploitation, dissemination (PED) nodes to enable tipping and cuing to provide persistent surveillance.5) Provide the ability to search and discover ISR asset availability and location in support of persistent surveillance.c. ISR Support to Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)/Strike to Achieve Combat Effectiveness and Minimize Civilian Casualties and Fratricide1) Provide relevant, timely and accurate ISR and operational target information to JTACS/Fire Support Elements (FSEs) to include information on potential fratricide, collateral damage and civilian casualties.2) Provide accurate ISR target location data suitable for both mobile and static targets.3) Provide interoperable ISR data for close air support (CAS) suites.4) Provide/receive interoperable ISR data to support multi-national CAS.5) Provide sufficient bandwidth/throughput at the tactical edge to support common operational picture (COP) generation. d. Information sharing to support Multi-national / Whole of Government Interoperability1) Provide/receive interagency and partner information and data in support of Situational Awareness (i.e.  Protection and Strategic Communications).2) Refine/develop information sharing capability and processes within each security domain to improve coordination across coalition operations.3) Assist in validating/defining data-tagging/requirements to support cross domain solutions, and enhance data sharing in compliance with established standards.4) Provide high bandwidth cross domain capabilities to support ISAF operations.5) Provide multi-domain, bi-directional, multi-lingual chat to support ISAF operations.
3. Coalition Participation Coalition participation is key to the success of EC10.  The anticipated international participants include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO member nations. C2 elements being simulated include:  ISAF HQ; JIOC-A; CENTCOM JIOC Response Cell; an ISAF Regional Command; a Multi-National Combat Brigade TOC (Live); US, UK and Canadian Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and multinational Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT); and, a Virtual Multi-national Combat Brigade Team.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for a follow-on contract for the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) development, integration, testing, fielding, installation, modifications, training, and support. The IEWTPT program is a Non-system Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) used to train multiple Intelligence disciplines (IMINT, SIGINT, MASINT, HUMINT, GEOINT, OSINT). This contract is for continued development of the IEWTPT System, including the Technical Control Cell (TCC), associated interfaces to Target Signature Arrays (TSA's), and the HUMINT Control Cell (HCC).  In addition IEWTPT develops one of a kind exercise support tools as well as other TS/SCI timely sensitive training capabilities in support of GWOT requirements. IEWTPT also develops other products that incorporate GWOT fielded Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC's) training into the IEWTPT as the Program of Record (POR) for baselining and providing those training capabilities. The IEWTPT HUMINT training capability HUMINT Control Cell (HCC) is provided in a self-contained, standalone configuration (independent of the TCC) but it is expected to be fully integrated with the TCC in the follow-on contract.  The estimated value of this award is approximately $77.7M. Contractor must be ready to execute on day one after contract award by having the knowledge, resources, facilities, and security measures in place to be able to fulfill the contract requirements within the critical timeframe and timeliness that the requirements need to be met. The additional effort will continue the development and integration of IEWTPT key capabilities, integrate existing and future research into the HCC capabilities, and develop TS/SCI products requested by customers on a quick turn around basis.<BR><BR>The Government intends to pursue a sole source award to GD C4 Systems for the 2010-2014 requirements associated with this effort.  This notice is provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement.  <BR> <BR>The point of contact for information regarding this solicitation is Felicia Kolb at (407) 380-4221.  Responses can be sent to felicia.kolb@us.army.mil by 30 Oct 09.  This is not a request for proposals.    <BR>

Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of quotations. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. (This section is reserved for Request for Proposals using FAR Part 15 except as described by (f)(6) of this section) <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.<br />(2)<br />(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.<br />(6) In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2 on a Best Value basis considering price and technical acceptability. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Multiple awards. (To be used at the Contracting Officers discretion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.<br />(1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to--<br />GSA Federal Supply Service Specifications Section<br />Suite 8100<br />470 L'Enfant Plaza, SW<br />Washington, DC 20407<br />Telephone (202) 619-8925)<br />Facsimile (202 619-8978)<br />(ii) If the General Services Administration, Department of Agriculture, or Department of Veterans Affairs issued this solicitation, a single copy of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained free of charge by submitting a request to the addressee in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this provision. Additional copies will be issued for a fee.<br />(2) Most unclassified Defense specifications and standards may be downloaded from the following ASSIST websites:<br />(i) ASSIST (http://assist.daps.dla.mil).<br />(ii) Quick Search (http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch).<br />(iii) ASSISTdocs.com (http://assistdocs.com).<br />(3) Documents not available from ASSIST may be ordered from the Department of Defense Single Stock Point (DoDSSP) by--<br />(i) Using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard (http://assist.daps.dla.mil/wizard);<br />(ii) Phoning the DoDSSP Customer Service Desk (215) 697-2179, Mon-Fri, 0730 to 1600 EST; or<br />(iii) Ordering from DoDSSP, Building 4, Section D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094, Telephone (215) 697-2667/2179, Facsimile (215) 697-1462.<br />(4) Nongovernment (voluntary) standards must be obtained from the organization responsible for their preparation, publication or maintenance.<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

Project Description:		Architectural/Interior Design for JGB Board/Meeting Rooms Upgrade 

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) is seeking the services of a Architect-Engineer (A-E) to perform Architectural/Interior Design and Engineering Services for the upgrade of the Board and Meeting Rooms at WMATAs headquarters, the Jackson Graham Building (JGB), located at 600 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington D.C., 20001.  The areas in this scope include the Board Room, the Meeting Room, and adjacent supporting areas such as the connecting vestibule/corridor between the Board Room and Meeting Room entrances, the Caucus Room, the Press Room, and audio-visual equipment areas.  WMATA plans to make several upgrades to these rooms, including some architectural features, a new horse-shoe shaped custom built-in board room table, a raised platform for the board room table area, an opening in the wall between the Caucus Room and Board Room raised platform area, an access ramp to the raised platform level in the Caucus Room, art work, audio-visual equipment, lighting, wall finishes, carpet, etc.  WMATA also plans to remove the non bearing masonry wall between the Board and Meeting rooms and replace it with a new acoustic folding partition and track, to allow both rooms to function as one for large gatherings.  WMATA also plans to upgrade some AV equipment and microphones before this project begins. 

This project is divided into three (3) major phases, but only Phase One is being considered at this time.  For Phase 1, the selected designer shall produce at least three concept interior design options, with proposed finishes and colors on presentation boards with actual samples of materials including but not limited to carpet, wall panel system and fabric finishes, paint colors, wood finishes, lighting schemes and fixture types, photos of chairs and their finishes, hardware finishes, a 3-D color illustration of what the rooms will look like and any significant detailing that affects the areas appearance for each option.  Color and finish boards of the three options shall be reviewed by WMATAs upper management for comments, and a final selection shall be made and approved. 

See attached solicitation documents.

All questions shall be directed to the Contract Administrator, Mr. Nichel Crooks who can be reached at ncrooks@wmata.com or at (202) 962-1440.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-10-Q-80011 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).   This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36.  The NAICS Code is 541519 and the Small Business size standard is $25.0M. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price contract.

The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John  A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is seeking to purchase an aviation data license that will offer flexible, comprehensive access to the 2000 -2014 data years of the following two types of commercial aviation databases:
An historical airline schedule and monthly Locations / Daylights Savings Time (DST) database; and
A world fleet database.
Both databases will be utilized by the Volpe Center to support various Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation analysis modeling tools to generate results for the 2000 - 2014 data years. 
The Volpe Center would like to procure a five-year license to obtain the 2000-2014 data, consisting of one base year and four option years.
The purchased database license must fulfill the Volpe Center's schedule and fleet database needs described in the Description of License section below for the existing data years 2000-2008 during the period of performance. Also within this period of performance, the Volpe Center will be given access to all 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 schedule and fleet data that becomes available through annual database updates. For purposes of consistency of data being provided for both datasets in the database (i.e., historical airline schedule data and world fleet data), both datasets being offered must originate from a single source of supply, rather than from different sources for each of the two datasets. All data must be compatible with pre-processing codes and internal algorithms that have already been developed for its aviation analysis modeling tools.
Description of License and Period of Performance
The database license provided by the vendor will have a period of performance of five years (including options) from the date of purchase and will provide the following data:
Historical Schedule Data
The modeling tools require the 2000 - 2014 historical airline schedule databases. The data to be delivered must consist of all worldwide monthly historical airline schedules for January through December of each year from 2000 - 2014, including carrier detail. The 2000 - 2014 historical schedule databases consist of the following:
The historical databases for the years 2000 - 2014, made available via download in comma delimited format (CSV) for each year from 2000 - 2014; and
The 2000 - 2014 monthly Locations / DST files, made available via download in text file format (TXT) for the years 2000 - 2014.
World Fleet Data
The modeling tools require the 2000 - 2014 world fleet databases. The data to be delivered must consist of all worldwide biannual airline fleet information for each year from 2000 - 2014, made available via download in text definition file format (TDF) for each year from 2000 - 2014.

Deliverables:
One five-year data (including options) license granting access to downloads of 2000 - 2014 historical schedule data and world fleet data, as described in the "Description of License" section above.

A copy of the statement of work is attached to this synopsis/solicitation.

Interested sources must submit a capabilities package demonstrating their past and current experience with work of this nature. Information provided must be detailed in the area(s) above so the Government can assess the ability of your company to provide the described services. Information should be provided in either Word (2007 or earlier version) or PDF.

Each response must reference the synopsis/solicitation number and or title. In accordance with the NAICS provided, all Offerors must state whether they are a large or small business. Offerors are requested to provide their DUNS and CCR numbers.

<p>19. TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>The Secretary can terminate this lease as follows:</p>
<p>a. NON-COMPLIANCE. The Secretary can terminate this lease if Lessee fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions specified herein by the issuance of at least thirty (30) days' written notice; provided, that the Lessee has not made diligent attempts to cure. The Lessee shall have no claim for damages.</p>
<p>b. INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY: The Secretary may terminate this lease and re-enter and take possession of the property upon issuance of at least five (5) days' written notice to the Lessee if it is determined that Lessee's assets are assigned to a trustee for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p>c. BREACH OF THE LEASE BY THE LESSEE;</p>
<p>d. TERMINATION DUE TO NATIONAL EMERGENCY. The Government may revoke or terminate this lease in whole or in part as set out above or in the event of;</p>
<p>(1) during any national emergency declared by the President of the United States or Congress, the Secretary of the Army determines that a termination is necessary; or</p>
<p>(2) the Secretary of the Army determines that termination of the lease is required for military purposes or is necessary in the interests of national defense; or</p>
<p>(3) base closure, deactivation, or substantial realignment of the installation; or</p>
<p>(4) The Lessee will be given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice by the District Commander in the event this lease is revoked or terminated in accordance with this condition, except for condition 20(2) above where advance notice to the Lessee shall not be required. In lieu of revocation for violation of the terms and conditions of this lease, the Government may exercise any other available legal remedy.</p>
<p>20. RENTAL ADJUSTMENT</p>
<p>In the event the Secretary revokes this lease or in any other manner materially reduces the leased area or materially affects its use by the Lessee prior to the expiration date, an equitable adjustment will be made in the rental paid or to be paid under this lease. Such adjustment of rental shall be evidenced by a supplemental agreement in writing; provided, however, that none of the provisions of this condition shall apply in the event of revocation because of noncompliance by the Lessee with any of the terms and conditions of this lease.</p>
<p>21. PROHIBITED USES</p>
<p>The Lessee shall not permit gambling on the premises or install or operate, or permit to be installed or operated thereon, any device which is illegal; or use the premises or permit them to be used for any illegal business or purpose. There shall not be conducted on or permitted upon the premises any activity which would constitute a nuisance. The Lessee shall not sell, store or dispense, or permit the sale, storage, or dispensing of beer or other intoxicating liquors on the premises.</p>
<p>22. NATURAL RESOURCES</p>
<p>The Lessee shall cut no timber, conduct no mining operations, remove no sand, gravel, or kindred substances from the ground, commit no waste of any kind, nor in any manner substantially change the contour or condition of the premises except as authorized in writing by said officer.</p>
<p>23. DISPUTES CLAUSE</p>
<p>a. Except as provided in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601-613) (the Act), all disputes arising under or relating to this lease shall be resolved under this clause and the provisions of the Act.</p>
<p>b. "Claim", as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by the Lessee seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of lease terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this lease. A claim arising under this lease, unlike a claim relating to this lease, is a claim that can be resolved under a lease clause that provides for the relief sought by the Lessee. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Lessee seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified as required by subparagraph c.(2) below. The routine request for rental payments that are not in dispute is not a claim under the Act. The request may be converted to a claim under the Act, by this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>c. (1) A claim by the Lessee shall be made in writing and submitted to the District Commander for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Lessee shall be subject to a written decision by the District Commander.</p>
<p>(2) For Lessee claims exceeding $100,000, the Lessee shall submit with the claim a certification that --</p>
<p>(i) the claim is made in good faith;</p>
<p>(ii) supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the Lessee's knowledge and belief; and<br /><br />(iii) the amount requested accurately reflects the lease adjustment for which the Lessee believes the Government is liable.</p>
<p><br />(3) (i) If the Lessee is an individual, that individual shall execute the certification.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Lessee is not an individual, the certification shall be executed by --<br />(A) a senior company official in charge of the Lessee's location involved; or</p>
<p>(B) an officer or general partner of the Lessee having overall responsibility for the conduct of the Lessee's affairs.</p>
<p>d. For Lessee claims of $100,000 or less, the District Commander must, if requested in writing by the Lessee, render a decision within sixty (60) days of the request. For Lessee-certified claims over $100,000, the District Commander must, within sixty (60) days, decide the claim or notify the Lessee of the date by which the decision will be made.</p>
<p>e. The District Commander's decision shall be final unless the Lessee appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.</p>
<p>f. At the time a claim by the Lessee is submitted to the District Commander or a claim by the Government is presented to the Lessee, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative means of dispute resolution. When using alternate dispute resolution procedures, any claim, regardless of amount, shall be accompanied by the certification described in paragraph c.(2) of this clause, and executed in accordance with paragraph c.(3) of this clause.</p>
<p>g. The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid by the <br />Government from (1) the date the District Commander receives the claim (properly certified if required), or (2) the date payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the District<br />Commander receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each six-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim. Rental amounts due to the Government by the Lessee will have interest and penalties as set out in Condition 2. CONSIDERATION.</p>
<p>h. The Lessee shall proceed diligently with the performance of the lease, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, or action arising under the lease, and comply with any decision of the District Commander.</p>
<p>24. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</p>
<p>a. Within the limits of their respective legal powers, the parties to this lease shall protect the premises against pollution of its air, ground, and water. The Lessee shall comply with any laws, regulations, conditions, or instructions affecting the activity hereby authorized if and when issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, or any Federal, state, interstate or local governmental agency having jurisdiction to abate or prevent pollution. The disposal of any toxic or hazardous materials within the premises is specifically prohibited. Such regulations, conditions, or instructions in effect or prescribed by said Environmental Protection Agency, or any Federal, state, interstate or local governmental agency are hereby made a condition of this lease. The Lessee shall not discharge waste or effluent from the premises in such a manner that the discharge will contaminate streams or other bodies of water or otherwise become a public nuisance.</p>
<p>b. The Lessee will use all reasonable means available to protect the environment and natural resources, and where damage nonetheless occurs from activities of the Lessee, the Lessee shall be liable to restore the damaged resources.</p>
<p>c. The use of any pesticides or herbicides within the premises is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>25. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF PROPERTY (ECP)</p>
<p>An Environmental Condition of Property (ECP) documenting the known history of the property with regard to the storage, release or disposal of hazardous substances thereon, is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit D. Upon expiration, revocation or relinquishment of this lease, another ECP shall be prepared which will document the environmental condition of the property at that time. A comparison of the two assessments will assist the said officer in determining any environmental restoration requirements. Any such requirements will be completed by the Lessee in accordance with Condition 15. RESTORATION.</p>
<p>26. HISTORIC PRESERVATION</p>
<p>The Lessee shall not remove or disturb, or cause or permit to be removed or disturbed, any historical, archeological, architectural, or other cultural artifacts, relics, remains or objects of antiquity. In the event such items are discovered on the premises, the Lessee shall immediately notify said officer and protect the site and the material from further disturbance until said officer gives clearance to proceed.</p>
<p>27. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION</p>
<p>The Lessee shall maintain, in a manner satisfactory to said officer, all soil and water conservation structures that may be in existence upon said premises at the beginning of or that may be constructed by the Lessee during the term of this lease, and the Lessee shall take appropriate measures to prevent or control soil erosion within the premises. Any soil erosion occurring outside the premises resulting from the activities of the Lessee shall be corrected by the Lessee as directed by the said officer.</p>
<p>28. TAXES</p>
<p>Any and all taxes imposed by the state or its political subdivisions upon the property or interest of the Lessee in the premises shall be paid promptly by the Lessee. If and to the extent that the property owned by the Government is later made taxable by state or local governments under an Act of Congress, the lease shall be renegotiated.</p>
<p>29. COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES</p>
<p>The Lessee warrants that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure this lease upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the Lessee for the purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, the United States shall have the right to annul this lease without liability or, in its discretion, to require the Lessee to pay, in addition to the lease rental or consideration, the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.</p>
<p>30. OFFICIALS NOT TO BENEFIT</p>
<p>No member of or delegate to Congress or resident commissioner shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease or to any benefits to arise therefrom. However, nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to any incorporated company if this lease is for the general benefit of such corporation or company.</p>
<p>31. SEVERAL LESSEES</p>
<p>If more than one Lessee is named in this lease, the obligations of said Lessees herein contained shall be joint and several obligations.</p>
<p>32. MODIFICATIONS</p>
<p>This lease contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto, and no modification of this agreement, or waiver, or consent hereunder shall be valid unless the same be in writing, signed by the parties to be bound or by a duly authorized representative and this provision shall apply to this condition as well as all other conditions of this lease.</p>
<p>33. DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>This lease is effective only insofar as the rights of the United States in the premises are concerned, and the Lessee shall obtain any permit or license which may be required by Federal, state, or local statute in connection with the use of the premises. It is understood that the granting of this lease does not preclude the necessity of obtaining a Department of the Army permit for activities which involve the discharge of dredge or fill material or the placement of fixed structures in the waters of the United States, pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U. S. C. &sect; 403), and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U. S. C. &sect; 1344).</p>
<p>34. LABOR MATERIAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES</p>
<p>Lessee shall bear the sole responsibility for furnishing and paying for all labor, materials, equipment and supplies used in conjunction with the exercise by the Lessee of any right granted hereunder, unless specifically absolved from said responsibilities elsewhere within this lease.</p>
<p>35. DESTRUCTION BY UNAVOIDABLE CASUALTY</p>
<p>If the premises shall be destroyed or be so totally damaged by fire or other unavoidable casualty so as to render the premises untenantable, wholly or in part, then payment of rent shall cease and either party may forthwith terminate this lease by written notice to that effect. If part of the premises were rendered untenantable, rental payment may be apportioned to reflect the part remaining usable to Lessee.</p>
<p>36. SUB-CONTRACTORS AND AGENT FOR LESSEE</p>
<p>All work must be performed by skilled tradesmen who are accomplished at their craft and bonded against loss due to damages resulting directly or indirectly from work performed.</p>
<p>37. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS</p>
<p>The Secretary or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until expiration of three (3) years after final payment under this lease, have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and/or records of the Lessee involving transactions relating to lease of this site.</p>
<p>38. RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE</p>
<p>The installation, operation and maintenance of Lessee's equipment will in no manner, interfere with users already operating on or in the vicinity of the premises. In the event Lessee or its equipment causes interference as noted above, then Lessee shall, at its expense, eliminate such interference within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of notice of such interference. Lessee will not re-use its equipment until such interference is permanently eliminated (except for brief testing which must be coordinated with the said officer). In the event Lessee is not able to permanently eliminate such interference within thirty (30) days from receipt of said officer's notice, then the Secretary may terminate this lease immediately.</p>
<p>39. COORDINATION OF ELECTRICAL/COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTION, ETC.</p>
<p>Installation of any antennas, cabling, and related equipment shall be done in accordance with existing Federal, state and municipal codes, including the National Electrical Code and any other codes which directly relate to the issues of communication equipment and/or antennas. In any case, where codes differ, the more stringent application shall prevail. All work shall be done by personnel who are bonded and licensed tradesmen. Lessee is required to coordinate installation of all electrical connections that tie into building systems that would be affected. Nothing in this condition shall be construed as diminishing the right of the Government to review and approve all such work, nor does it absolve Lessee from its obligation to obtain such review and approval. The requirements of this condition are above and beyond the requirements for the Government's review and approval.</p>
<p>40. UTILITIES</p>
<p>a. The Lessee shall pay the cost, as determined by the officer having jurisdiction over the premises, of producing and/or supplying any utilities and other services furnished by the Government for the use of the Lessee, including the Lessee's proportionate share of the cost of operation and maintenance of the Government-owned facilities by which such utilities or services are produced or supplied. Payment shall be made in the manner prescribed by the officer having such jurisdiction. If required by the installation, the Lessee shall be responsible, at its expense, for the installation of utility meters. Specifications for the utility meters will be obtained from said officer.</p>
<p>b. In the event all or any portion of the premises utilized for utility lines shall be needed by the United States, or in the event the existence of said utility lines is determined to be detrimental to Governmental activities, the Lessee shall from time to time, upon notice to do so, and as often as so notified, remove said facilities to such other location as may be designated by said officer. In the event said facilities shall not be removed or relocated within ninety (90) days after such notice, the United States may cause such relocation at the sole expense of the Lessee.</p>
<p>41. AUTHORIZED USE AND CONSTRUCTION APPROVAL</p>
<p>The Lessee is only authorized to construct, operate, and maintain a telecommunications tower and related support equipment on the premises. The Lessee shall not construct or place any structure, improvement or advertising sign or allow or permit such construction or placement without prior written approval of the said officer. All initial and future construction plans and specifications shall be approved by the said officer in writing prior to commencement of construction. Installation of any antennas by the Lessee or any sublessee and/or any changes which affect characteristics of the site, such as radiated power, frequency band, etc., will require approval of said officer and analysis by the DoD JSC prior to installation. A copy of the approved analysis must be provided to the said officer.</p>
<p>42. LESSEE PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The failure of the United States to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of the lease shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Government's right to the future performance of any such terms, covenants, or conditions, but the obligations of the Lessee with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>43. GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO UTILIZE TOWER SPACE</p>
<p>At no cost to the Government, one (1) position will be reserved for exclusive use of the Government above the 160-foot level of each tower. Government reserves the right of first refusal for exclusive use, at fair market value of a second position if only one (1) remaining position is available above the 140-foot level of each tower. If the Government does not exercise its right of first refusal within thirty (30) days after the antenna position is made available to the Government, Lessee is authorized to sublease the position to any other acceptable third party. If the Government exercises the right of first refusal, Lessee's future rental consideration will be offset in an amount equal to the fair market value of the antenna position.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established seven permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Kathmandu, Nepal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in the Middle East.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team. Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull; Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.<br /><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor. However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the respective Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established seven permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Kathmandu, Nepal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion.

The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>

<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team.

<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>FEMA intends to compete disaster related residential damage verification contracts within 18 months. This request for information is intended to identify industry capability to perform the work accurately and expeditiously. Overview The responses are to include available technology, human resources and methodologies to perform residential damage inspections in routine and catastrophic disaster declarations. FEMA is interested in an inspector staffing structure that guarantees trained inspector availability for regular and catastrophic events. Just in time hiring for disaster declarations is not preferred. For catastrophic events, FEMA would like to know if the industry could interject technology along with human resources as a means to provide quick and immediate assistance to disaster applicants. Catastrophic events may only occur once during the life of the contract. FEMA wants a greater flexibility for these contracts to perform other assistance activities as deemed appropriate in a field disaster setting such as applicant recertification, home inspections without the applicant present and registration at mega-shelters. FEMA is also interested in the GIS capabilities and applications by the contractor to provide residential damage inspections via technology without a visit by an inspector to the damage site. These objectives for this RFI are to identify industry capability, time lines and realistic input to perform ten (10) twenty (20) and thirty (30) thousand inspections per day for large events that may only occur once during the life of the contract and perform as little as twenty-five (25), one hundred (100) and five thousand (5,000) inspections per day during the majority of the period of performance for these contracts. FEMA is interested in having inspector personnel prepositioned at the ready no more than two (2) hours from the impact area and capable to start inspections on the same day of the declaration. The financial objective for this RFI is to seek comments on the new Housing Inspection Service contracts to require Readiness and Inspection cost transparency. FEMA will want a cost breakdown for each to determine all cost associated with the fixed price proposed. FEMA is interested in potentially awarding contracts by sector. FEMA is planning to subdivide the CONUS to include OCONUS into four (4) sectors. A prime will be selected for each sector and will be primarily assigned for all disaster declarations in that sector. Mega-events may require tasking a contractor from one sector to assist in another sector. Failure to meet production requirements, quality control requirements and aging requirements will result in significant readiness and inspection penalties. Conversely, significant incentives for exceeding production, inspection aging and quality will be awarded. Review of information proposals will be performed by FEMA Acquisitions and Program Management personnel. Information proposals are due 10/08/2009. The RFI responses will be evaluated, the criteria provided will be used in the preparation of the Draft solicitation Organization background and Vendor information required A written response to our RFI including: Outline details about your organization - business sector, turnover, growth, locations, and number of employees Present systems - software systems, hardware (server / client), operating systems, database, network, LAN / WAN, transaction volumes, number of system users Details of the vendor&rsquo;s current functionality that meets FEMA&rsquo;s requirements to include a breakdown of a Readiness Plan that can meet routine and catastrophic disaster declarations. Vendor background, quality accreditations, experience of the systems proposed, your business sector and implementations Staff maintenance and support details, options, Service Level Agreements Implementation assistance and training Contact details of key staff involved FEMA intends to conduct an Industry Day on January 21, 2010 (tentatively) to discuss the program and answer questions. Please submit your comments or questions to Sean.g.Williams@DHS.GOV or Eddie.Murphy@DHS.GOV

This is a multi-story indoor firing range operation consisting of a total area of approximately 25,000 SF on the first floor (including small basement area) and 14,000 SF on the second floor (including roof level stair/elevator vestibule area).  The scope of renovations is limited to 572SF at basement level, 6,756 SF at first floor, 7,780 SF at second floor and 340 SF at roof level stair/elevator vestibule area).  Total renovated area is therefore approximately 15,448 SF.  In general, the scope of work involves demolition and removal of existing small weapons fire training facilities in four primary training room/spaces and miscellaneous adjacent spaces to conclude stair wells, corridors, and elevator shaft.  The major training rooms/spaces contain flexible simulated residential floor plan settings.  Partitions are movable and consists of ballistic resistant steel panels.  Typically, the walls, flooring, and ceilings of the training spaces are protected with layers of rubber curtains and or plants.  Other systems are also being renovated to include HVAC, electrical, and fire protection.  The existing HVAC system serving the renovated is bade on a supply system through the floor and the return at the ceiling.  This system concept is being reversed with supply from the ceiling and return through the floor.  
This project also removes, replaces and upgrades the movable ballistic wall panel system, and associated lamella rubber system in the training areas. This effort includes the replacement of 250 panels, 3' wide x 8' high in both Areas.  Panels include a ballistic resistant steel frame and ballistic resistant interior steel panel, and are covered with a layer of 1/4: self-healing fire retardant rubber linear material.  Scope also includes a new overhead track system for panels. Replacement of the lamella bullet trap protection is also included in the basic scope of this project.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD).

<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>

Foley U.S. Federal Courthouse in Spokane, Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY. Modification issued to terminate contract in its entirety due to the discovery of relatively high concentrations of radon within the Adits which significantly changes the requirements under the current contract.  Work for this project consists of clearing debris and mineralization from the existing radial drains within the North and South Seepage Control Adits, Abiquiu Dam, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The intent and purpose of this work is to clear radial drains and allow for unrestricted flow of seepage water that is collected by the Seepage Adits.  The Contractor shall provide all plans, labor, materials, shop facilities, supervision, tools, staging, scaffolding and any other items necessary for hydraulic/mechanical clearing of drains in the Adits.  Contractor shall identify and utilize all necessary power, lighting, safety requirement etc. from the existing power sources at the facility.  Depths of drains vary from 20 to 200 feet.  Drains are installed in 3-inch diameter core holes drilled into interlayered mudstone, sandstone and conglomerate and are lined with 1.5-inch ID, Schedule 80 PVC pipe.  During construction, water-bearing zones were identified in the core holes and perforated PVC pipe sections were located accordingly.  Solid PVC pipe sections have butyl packers attached to secure the entire assembly within the core hole.  Generally speaking, drains are oriented from 9 - 34 down from horizontal and from 56 82 up from the horizontal.  The North and South Adits can be accessed by way of paved and semi-improved dirt roads.  Access to the Adits will be provided by the Government.  Adits are 10 feet high and 9 feet wide.  Figure 2 shows a typical section that illustrates the Adits with the radial drain layout.<BR><BR>Contract duration is 180 calendar days.  NAICS Code 561790 with a size standard of $7 Million.<BR>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Futhermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already in the midst of the job and this modification is to add funding needed to complete the job as a result of the failure of government-owned equipment and a flood event.  2)  The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  3) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  4)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.

AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs, Procurement Business Division, Tres Rios Building, San Patricio, 27 Ave. J. Gonzalez Giusti, Suite 600, Guaynabo, PR, 00968. 	2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: This is sole source contract action for a base period of one (1) year from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010 with an option period of six (6) months with IRC Air & Contractor, Inc. for preventive maintenance and emergency repairs services for the steam boilers at VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS), San Juan, Puerto Rico.

IRC Air & Contractor, Inc. is currently performing the repairs and preventive maintenance contract to the Boiler Units.  IRC has performed all repairs and preventive maintenance satisfactory and in a timely manner.  IRC has always responded excellently during emergency repairs.  IRC is the authorized manufacturer representative for this equipment.  In addition, IRC has original parts that can be provided which will not affect the specified performance Boiler Units.  This action is the only cost effective way to continue with these critical services without interruption until a new contract is awarded. Contractor is a Small Business.6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: A new, long term acquisition is pending development of scope of work tailored to only one boiler unit versus two at the present time. Development of scope of work is being impacted by the installation of a new boiler unit to replace one (1) of the existing two (2) boiler units. The completion of the new boiler installation is scheduled for September 2010. While the new boiler installation is underway, the service will be developing a new scope of work to conduct market survey and all other requirements to submit procurement package to the Procurement Business Division based on the findings.7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  Estimated cost is based on current costs with an inflation rate.  A request for Proposal will be issued to the Contractor.  Contractors proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost.  Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price for both parties. 8.  MARKET RESERCH: A market survey was not conducted for this action since IRC is the only firm that can meet Government requirements within the timeframe required as indicated in paragraph 5 and 6 above. 9.  OTHER FACTORS: None10.  INTERESTED SOURCES: No other sources can provide the services in accordance with the Government needs in the required time frame. Refer to paragraph 8.11.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: Refer to paragraph 6. 12. TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.NAME:  Edgar Cordero                              DATE: 9/14/09TITLE:  Project Manager		                  SIGNATURE: /S/13.
