<SUBJECT>A -- Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center
<DESC>The Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC) is assessing the market to gain information about commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Command and Control (C2) software products for potential use at Air Force bases world-wide supporting Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection. Information about the software's ability to support base emergency response forces (medical, fire, security forces, civil engineering, etc.), ease of use, and compatibly with existing systems will be considered. Currently, several different solutions are being employed by Air Force installations.

SURVIAC is requesting detailed product literature, a tailored vendor demonstration, and evaluation software to assist in determining the capability of software against specific requirements.  C2 software vendors are invited to participate by initially providing information about their products.  Based on the information provided and market research, qualified vendors will be given the opportunity to continue in the assessment process by demonstrating capabilities of their software offering and providing software and hardware as needed to perform a more in-depth assessment of functional capabilities.

The following capabilities, in a non-prioritized order, are of  specific interest to SURVIAC: ability to display map layers; locate crash, spill, fire, flood, accident, attacks; accept inputs from Emergency Responce Unit Control Centers (ER UCC's); generate cordon locations and sizes; automatically generate Tactical Control Point) TCP and stage Entry Control Point (ECP) locations; generate optimal routes; determine evacuation routes; notification and evacuation status; track emergency responder vehicle locations; model and plot potential toxic plumes; link facility floor plans to layout map; weather information; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive (CBRNE) sensor locations and alarms; security alarm/gate activation;, locations and status; generate and display threat domes for weapons; generate and display post locations; assets; weapons and coverage;, display local civil emergency locations; UXO locations; casualty locations; collection areas; restricted areas; and generate checklists and incident reports.

The goal of the assessment is to determine how well existing COTS products meet specific functional requirements.  These requirements and scenarios are derived from real-world needs, usability standards, and human factors. The specific requirements and assessment scenarios will be provided to qualified vendors.

Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes and does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred with participation in this assessment or in the submission of any information requested.     The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, BUT A MARKET SURVEY TO LOCATE POTENTIAL SOURCES.
