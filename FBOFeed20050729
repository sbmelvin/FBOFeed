<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the development and production of a video game. A LaRC proposal for development and dissemination of the Hurricane Hunters video game was selected in response to a NASA Research Announcement entitled, “INSPIRING THE NEXT GENERATION OF EARTH EXPLORERS: INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS FOR K-16 AND INFORMAL EDUCATION (NN-H-04-Z-YO-006-N).”	The proposal included Nightlight as an integral part of the proposal team and Nightlight was instrumental in development of the proposal. The objective of this requirement is to develop an interactive meteorological video game for middle-school aged students utilizing NASA real-world datasets. The game’s ground rules are based upon real-world NASA datasets and will provide students the opportunity to investigate a three-dimensional (3D) weather system. The period of performance shall be thirty-six months.  NASA/LaRC intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Nightlight Studios for the development and production of a video game.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10. U.S.C. 2304(c)(1),"Only One Responsible Source," and is based on Nightlight's previous experience in educating the public on previous NASA science missions, their willingness to cost share, and their clear approach to marketing the program activities and achievements to a regional and national audience and their previous effort in development of the proposal. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for technical expertise to ensure that an interactive meteorological video game emphasizes inquiry-based problem solving, actively engages students to improve their spatial reasoning, and meets National Education Standards.  This requirement is also to update an existing Teacher Activity Guide for Meteorology, which will serve as a companion to the video game. A LaRC proposal for development and dissemination of this Hurricane Hunters video game was selected in response to a NASA Research Announcement entitled, “INSPIRING THE NEXT GENERATION OF EARTH EXPLORERS: INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS FOR K-16 AND INFORMAL EDUCATION (NN-H-04-Z-YO-006-N).” This proposal included Exline as an integral part of the proposal team. NASA/LaRC intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Exline Consulting Services, Inc., for consulting services. The period of performance shall be twelve months with two one year options. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1),"Only One Responsible Source," and is based on Exline's extensive experience in improving K-12 science education programs, the company's familiarity with and knowledge of NASA’s educational goals and objectives, and the fact that the company developed the aforementioned Teacher Activity Guide. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 12, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>This announcement is being placed in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.3.12 which requires all procurements over $100,000 to be publicly announced.  Further in accordance with the FAA AMS paragraph 3.2.2.4. the FAA has determined it to be in its best interest to single source a contract to New Bedford Panoramex. This requirement is to obtain approximately 70 Precision Approach Path Indicator Equipment (PAPI) Systems, plus spares and ancillary equipment, to meet short term requirements until such time as production and delivery begins on the Precision Approach Path Indicator Light System manufacturing contract awarded to DME Corporation on June 14, 2005 through an small business set aside competition. FAA has an existing contract with New Bedford Panoramex (NBP) for this equipment.  Under this contract we have already completed first article testing, and completed the learning curve associated with establishing and maintaining satisfactory production and quality control processes.  FAA requires systems that have either been specifically developed under Specification FAA-E-2756A or have been evaluated and tested to verify compliance with this specification.  NBP is the only vendor with a current production line for such systems. To purchase from another vendor would add unacceptable expense and delay to FAA's ability to obtain the required equipment. Based on the above, New Bedford Panoramex is the only source with the unique ability to satisfy the FAA's requirement in a timely and effective manner. No competitive solicitation is available for this procurement.

<DESC>Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).     MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) have been missing from the Medicare Contracting environment. CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The law directs CMS to conduct full and open competitions for new MACs, that will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries, and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program. As such, CMS anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC).     

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers. In addition to the core A/B MAC workload, CMS anticipates including optional services to be performed. Optional services include functions related to Graduate Medical Demonstration and the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration. It is anticipated that this competition will result in award of one, stand-alone A/B MAC contract.     This contract will include a base year and four, one-year options.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Melinda (Miki) Lewis, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-5461, or by sending e-mail to Melinda.Lewis@cms.hhs.gov. E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers. Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) by mid September 2005.

<DESC>The Netherlands Ministry of Defence intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the restoration by replacement of the Pernis-Woensdracht-Schoten Pipeline. The estimated cost for execution of the works is approximately Euro 25 million (USD $30 million).

The Netherlands serves as the Host Nation for this project, which was fully authorized by the Infrastructure Committee under one-step bidding procedure. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is MG2005000839 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference ICB-NETHERLANDS-2005-ADO-05-097-MG2005000839.

The project is NATO UNCLASSIFIED.  The NATO serials for this project are 2PL12026-0 and 2PL09384-0.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The projects involve the detailed and final design, the application for licenses, and the construction of an 83 km 10-inch steel pipeline with an operating pressure of 80 bars between Pernis depot (the Netherlands) and Schoten depot (Belgium). This includes the adaptation of the Pernis high pressure pump station into an electric driven pump station and adaptations of the manifolds in both Pernis and Schoten. The projects are described in NIS screening report AC/4(PP)D24871 dated 9 September 2004. 

Although the projects are planned in Belgium and the Netherlands, the projects will be handled as one complete project with one contract for both countries. The contract will be of the type (final) design and construction and will be based on the Dutch administrative conditions known as the Uniforme Administratieve Voorwaarden voor Gemtegreerde Contracten 2005. (Information available at: CROW, P.O. Box 37, 6710 BA EDE, The Netherlands; www.crow.nl)  As Dutch is a mutual language to both Host Nations, all project communication and information will be in the Dutch language.

Required skills of the potential contractor should be in the field of engineering and construction. With respect to engineering capabilities, experience with calculations as described in the NEN 3650 and NEN 3651 Pipeline code is required to finalize the different license requests.

With respect to the construction phase, specific capabilities with respect to construction capacity, planning, and quality assurance are required.

(Information available at: Bureau Stichting Buisleidingenstraat Nederland, Wilhelminastraat 12, 4701 GX, Roosendaal, The Netherlands; www.buisleidingenstraat.nl)  The second construction phase is planned to last at maximum a period of 3 months. During that period, the existing pipeline needs to be purged and removed over a length of approximately 30 km, while at the same time installing the new 10-inch pipeline and finalizing all works to prepare the total pipeline for operational use. Concerning construction capacity, the contractor needs to be capable of constructing at least 1 km of 10-inch pipeline per day. In this context, it is important that the contractor be responsible for all purchases of required materials, including the long lead items as the line pipe and the new electric-driven high pressure pump sets. With respect to planning and quality assurance, the contractor has to prove, before and during execution of the construction projects, that the working plan, organization, and quality control guarantee that the new pipeline system is built according to the specifications and is fit for operational use on schedule.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Kulite Pressure Sensors to be used in conbination with existing pressure sensors in the NASA Langley Quiet Flow Facility (QFF). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc.  The pressure sensors (kulites) that have been mounted into model airfoil surfaces are at locations from the leading edge to the trailing edges for the airfoil without interfering with the true airfoil surface.	The airfoils instrumentd with kulites have and will be used to obtain unsteady pressure measurements in the QFF for airframe noise studies.  The kulites being requested are in addition to other pressue sensors already being used within the QFF.  Utilization of the same pressue transducers allows for seamless integration into data acquisition system and processing software.  If sensors other than kulites are purchased this would require modification and additional resources (additional cost and workforce) to integrate into existing laboratory equipment and data reduction software.   These kulites are also required because of their small size and high frequency response.  They have no pressure reference tube and thus measure the total pressure signal, not just the mean or dynamic pressure. The enclosure for the pressure sensor diaphram also is specially designed to enclose only that region direcly above the cavity which feeds into the tube for mounting.	This design ensures that the cavity helmholtz frequency is at its highest level.	The qff is supportyng a number of focused and base programs concerning airframe noise and its control.  The measurements obtained through the use of the sensors are necessary to determine the surface response of the unsteady flow resopnsible for airframe noise.  The measurements provide information necessary to meet current and future milestones and objectives with respect to identifying, predicting, and controlling key noise producing flow field structure. The authortiy for sole source is FAR 13.106-1. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 12, 2005.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Institute for Behavior and Health (IBH), Rockville, MD.
Purpose:
In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, there are no schools, public or private, that are now using random student drug testing (RSDT). That means there is no hands-on expertise locally with RSDT. This is a significant barrier to innovation in this region, an area of importance for the national adoption of RSDT. 

In order to strengthen the level of understanding of SDT in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, IBH proposes to facilitate a peer-to-peer mentoring program that would enable experienced school leaders from around the nation (Mentors) to network with and educate local school officials (Mentees) on the issue of student drug testing.  

The goals of the proposed mentoring program include supporting the Washington, DC metropolitan school leaders in their desires to improve and/or enhance prevention efforts in. their individual school systems, to facilitate mutual learning between Mentors and Mentees, to build a sense of community through networking, and finally to provide adequate resources to those individuals interested in learning more about current SDT programs around the nation


IBH has developed a keen understanding of practical, implementation issues, as well as policy and research issues around student drug testing.  As such, IBH has emerged as a national leader and expert on the subject of student drug testing.  Further, IBH has built the collaborative relationships nationally to recruit and sustain mentors for schools in Washington D.C. who are interested in making decisions about the implementation of random student drug testing.  Also, IBH’s national website on setting up a student drug testing program establishes IBH as a primary resource for schools and their mentors in their decision making process about whether to do random student drug testing and what it will take to get such a program going.  These credentials, along with IBH’s collaborative bent and innovative leadership put them in an extraordinary position to create and pilot this kind of mentoring program. 


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.   The National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory requires remote installation of a cement-based mine seal at NIOSH's Lake Lynn experimental mine.  

When underground access to a mine fire area is impossible or too dangerous, then airtight mine seals are built, in the area of the fire, either in-mine or remotely through vertical boreholes.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting research on improving the technology to remotely construct mine seals.  The effort outlined herein involves the remote installation of a mine seal.  The project work site is at the NIOSH's Lake Lynn Laboratory located off PA State Route 857, southwest of Fairchance, Fayette County, PA (about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, PA, and 10 miles northeast of Morgantown, WV). The mine seals will be installed remotely through a borehole that has been drilled and completed into a cross-cut between the B and C drifts of the underground mine.  The borehole has been completed to the mine opening with 6-in diameter casing and is about 200 ft deep.  The borehole intercepts the mine workings in a cross-cut that is approximately 19 ft wide and 40 ft long.  The mine floor slopes to the southwest on the order of 1.13 percent gradient.  A second borehole, located about 30 ft away, is available for viewing the mine seal installation through use of a downhole video camera.  Because the schedule of in-mine work and weather conditions at the Lake Lynn Laboratory play such an important role in determining the exact timing of work, construction of the seal may be delayed until spring of 2006.  The proposed work for the installation of each of the seals will be completed over a two (2) month time period in three phases as follows.  

Phase 1 – Development of a Project Plan - This work will be conducted over a one (1) month time period and will involve identification of the material to be used in the construction of the mine seal, development of a plan of work, and a material injection schedule.  This plan will be jointly developed between NIOSH and the Contractor. 

Phase 2 - Construction of a Remote Mine Seal – Upon receipt of notification to proceed, the Contractor will implement the plan developed in concert with NIOSH in Phase 1.  Work under Phase 2 will involve construction of mine seal No. 1 as follows over a 1-2 day time period. The Contractor will construct the mine seals remotely through the injection borehole.  The installation of mine seal No. 1 will be made with direct visual and voice contact with those working in the underground mine environment.  NIOSH will provide access for the contractor using NIOSH-owned video equipment and mine telephones.  Underground access for direct viewing will also be provided for the Contractor. Seal construction will proceed until roof-to-floor and rib-to-rib closure has been achieved or it is deemed by that the material cannot fill the mine opening.  The Contractor will ensure seal material consistency throughout the construction process and will continuously monitor material flow, material density, pressure and flow progress.  

Once the installation of mine seal No. 1 is complete, the Contractor will meet with NIOSH personnel to review the process and to develop a plan for the installation of mine seal No. 2 (NIOSH will concurrently initiate the process for removal of mine seal No. 1).  The plan for mine seal No. 2 will follow the process outlined in Phase 1.  It is understood that the material mix, delivery system or injection schedule for the second mine seal may be modified to remedy any problems identified during construction of the first mine seal.  The second seal will be constructed without direct voice communication with those observing the process in the mine (note, viewing of the construction process will be available of the injection borehole site from a NIOSH monitor that will be connected to a video camera installed in the monitoring borehole located 30 ft away).  Seal construction will proceed until roof-to-floor and rib-to-rib closure has been achieved or it is deemed by that the material cannot fill the mine opening.  The Contractor will ensure seal material consistency throughout the construction process and will continuously monitor material flow, material density, pressure and flow progress.  It is estimated that as much as 220 yd3 of material may be needed to fill construct each mine seal and fill the underground cross-cut area.

Phase 3 - Development of a Summary Report - Once the mine seals have been constructed, the Contractor will generate a report for NIOSH describing the approach, construction process used including material injection rates, recorded pressures, volume of material used, copies of field charts and treatment reports, etc.  The contractor will also identify problems encountered and suggestions, if any, for improving the mine seal construction process.  This work will be completed over a one month period.  The material mix, delivery system or injecton schedule for the second mine seal may be modified to remedy problems identified during construction of the first mine seal.

At present, Halliburton is the only company known to commercially provide a high-rate, bulk cement-based material injection process for remote mine seal construction in active underground coal mines.  This process has been exclusively used by mine operators to remotely construct mine seals for mine fire suppression in underground coal mines.  Unfortunately, the mine seals that have been constructed using this process have not completely closed the mine opening and therefore did not seal the mine as designed.  NIOSH is conducting ongoing research to evaluate and improve the technology to remotely construct mine seals.  NIOSH is therefore interested in evaluating the Halliburton seal construction process and the resultant mine seal at their Lake Lynn Experimental Mine.

Organizations that believe they can provide a seal construction  process comparable to the one identified above are encouraged to identify themselves to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice.  Interested parties shall provide documentation which demonstrates that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:   Brenda L. Goodwin., Reference: #2005-Q-02293, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will solely be used  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to Halliburton in  Charleston, West Virginia under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  All information received will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- NUCLEAR & RADIOLOGICAL DETECTION VERIFICATION AND REPORTING (NRDVR)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAANRDVR
<RESPDATE>080405
<ARCHDATE>12312005
<CONTACT>Larna Palmer, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6109, Fax 202-254-6167, Email Larna.Palmer@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.	BACKGROUND. In the fall of 2005, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, DHS intends to issue a series of Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) for the research and development of systems and enabling technologies for Nuclear and Radiological Detection, Verification, and Reporting (NRDVR).  These BAAs will be designed to elicit proposals to develop transformational products that will fulfill the DNDO mission of detecting and reporting illicit attempts to import or transport nuclear material, nuclear devices, or radiological material. “Transformational” indicates products that will, when developed and implemented, radically improve the effectiveness of detection and discrimination, significantly reduce the cost of procurement and operation, and/or increase the ease of use of a detection system in an operational environment. 

The BAAs will solicit the development of technologies, components, systems and operational methodologies in each of the following topic areas: 
(A)	Distributed and Mobile Detectors for Search and Surveillance (DMDSAS): This topic area is designed to detect potential nuclear/radiological threats during intermodal transport, in fixed locations and at special localized events, utilizing distributed mobile/static/relocatable sensors.  Subtopics include:  smart personal and mobile detectors that provide spectral discrimination, directional/imaging information,  and wireless capabilities such as automatic sharing and integration of data among detectors in the same vicinity; mobile/portable detectors for standoff search that provide source/background discrimination and directional/imaging information; methodology, architecture and design for sensor networks covering distribution topology, data transfer and reach-back; and novel solutions.  

(B)	Long-Dwell Detection in Transit (LDDT):  This topic area is divided into two categories:  (1) detection systems and associated technologies that can be integrated into or attached to a cargo conveyance (vehicle, truck, cargo ship, air carrier, general aviation, etc.) or to containers shipped therein; and (2) mobile detection components, systems, and related technologies that can be integrated into various moving platforms (vehicles, marine craft, aircraft) to provide overt/covert standoff screening of suspect vehicles, boats and planes over long-dwell times with variable, relative positioning.  Subtopics include:  advanced, application-dependent neutron/photon sensors; position/location sensors; and novel solutions.  

(C)	Active Detection and Verification (ADV) of Shielded Special Nuclear Material (SSNM):  This topic area focuses on state-of-the-art active technologies for the detection and verification of shielded SNM.  Operational modes of interest include: (1) high-throughput systems at high-volume ports for resolving alarms from primary screening systems – advanced spectral and radiographic portals; (2) lower-throughput, smaller systems at low-volume ports and between ports-of-entry for primary or secondary screening applications; (3) mobile/hand-portable devices for SNM verification in maritime and land based environments.  Subtopics include:  electron/ion accelerators; photon/neutron generators; advanced radiography; prompt/fast neutron detectors; and novel solutions.  

(D)	Innovative Detector Materials (IDM):  This topic area seeks: (1) physically robust sensor component technologies that provide improved detection, identification and discrimination over existing materials; and (2) advances in manufacturing technology that lead to a reduction in fabrication costs and an increase in sensor sizes and choice of shapes without loss in performance.  The focus is on the following performance characteristics: ambient temperature operations, better efficiency, better energy resolution, faster response time, and less sensitivity to vibrations.  Subtopics include: scintillation materials; solid state charge collection materials; prompt/fast/spectral neutron detectors; and novel solutions.  

(E)	Alternate Signatures of Nuclear/Radiological Threats (ASNRT):  This topic area seeks advanced non-intrusive concepts for the detection and/or identification of nuclear/radiological materials and devices, without the direct detection of nuclear radiation.  ASNRT might utilize, for example, other properties such as mass, density, temperature, etc.  

2.	DETAILED INFORMATION SOUGHT. IN PREPARATION FOR THE NRDVR BAA, DHS IS REQUESTING FEEDBACK ON THE TOPICS LISTED IN SECTION 1 FROM ALL INTERESTED SOURCES (PRIVATE, PUBLIC, ACADEMIC, AND FEDERALLY FUNDED R&D CENTERS).   IN PARTICULAR, DHS REQUESTS EXPERT OPINION ON THE ABOVE TOPIC AND SUBTOPIC AREAS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED APPLICABILITY TO A LAYERED DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.  ADDITIONS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE TOPIC AREAS AND SUBTOPICS ARE WELCOME, BEARING IN MIND THAT DHS INTENDS THE ENTIRE SET OF TOPICS TO INCLUDE ALL TECHNICAL APPROACHES THAT WOULD BE USEFUL IN HELPING PERFORM ITS MISSION.  
3.	PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION.   Responses should be in an electronic format (Microsoft Word or PowerPoint) and sent via email to david.penn@associates.dhs.gov.   All responses shall be limited to a maximum of four pages in font 12pts (or larger) and shall include a point of contact with phone number and e-mail address.  Please use the title “NRDVR-05-RFI” as the subject line of the e-mail.  All responses must be received by 04 August, 2005 to allow adequate time for review.   Responders are advised that all submissions become Government property and may become public information.  
4.	PURPOSE.  This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a BAA or a promise to issue a BAA in the future.  This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DHS is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals on these topics.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at responder expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future BAA, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website will contain a synopsis.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the site for additional information.  
5.	POINTS OF CONTACT.  Refer questions to Dr. R. Leon Feinstein (Program Manager) at Leon.Feinstein@dhs.gov or to Larna Palmer (Contracting Officer) at Larna.Palmer@dhs.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>081505
<ARCHDATE>10142005
<CONTACT>Toni Spalding, (586) 574-8895
<DESC>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A critical need exists to acquire Construction Equipment (CE) Crew Protection Kits for the following systems (minimum and maximum quantities will be provided at time of Request for Proposal release): 	Grader 130G 	2.5 Cubic Yard Loader MW24C 	Scraper 621B					 	Tractor Full Tracked D7G/D7GwRPS		 	HYEX JDC230CLR					 	22 Ton Crane AT422T				 	VIB Roller CS563D	 	5 Cubic Yard Loader H100				 	HS Compactor 815F 	LRT 110 7.5 Ton Crane 	530S Pneumatic Roller			 The systems listed above are used worldwide by U.S. soldiers, with a large number currently being operated in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are extremely vulnerable as potential targets from small arms fire (7.62mm AP rounds) and improvised explosive de vices (IEDs).   Acquisition Strategy: The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for up to two (2) each, five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the design, prototype build, test, production, delivery of a Level III Technical Data Package (T DP), and installation of the CE Crew Protection Kits in Iraq and Afghanistan by the selected contractor. This function can be completed by U.S. citizens or third country national, but offerors are responsible for finding people who can complete the install  in a timely and satisfactory manner, and who can get onto the installation. The design, prototypes build and test efforts are on an accelerated schedule to meet the critical need for construction equipment operator protection.  Any orders issued under a p otential contract will be system specific.  Please note that we anticipate that most of the orders will be placed during the initial two years of the 5 year IDIQ contract.  Crew Protection Kits may either be a replacement cab or an add-on kit with an A-Kit/B-Kit design. The A-Kit shall contain the permanent mounting provisions along with any vehicle modifications required to accept the armor package (e.g. suspension changes d ue to the increased weight of the armor kit).  The B-Kit shall consist of armor components that will be mounted on the vehicle to provide operator survivability.  The selected contractor may be required to have access to classified data and shall be requir ed to comply with the requirements of DOD 5220-22-M National Industrial Security Program.  The Government will use source selection procedures to select the offeror whose proposal represents the Best Value to the Government.  An offerors submission must be a complete stand-alone proposal addressing all of the RFPs requirements.  The Government  reserves the right to award this contract without conducting discussions.  An offerors proposal must be comprehensive, fully responsive to the information requested in the RFP and reflect the offerors best prices. This is an accelerated acquisition.  Offerors are required to propose materials that have already been tested and approved by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to provide at least Class 3 Protection as defined in the attached Analysis of Threat Projectile s for Protection of Light Tactical Vehicles.  Offerors who are proposing the use of materials not previously tested and determined by the Government to provide this level of protection will not be evaluated.  Offerors can contact Louise Spangler at (410) 2 78-1448 or louise.spangler@dtc.army.mil for information on qualifying materials. Contract award is needed as soon as possible to facilitate the installation of CE Crew Protection Kits on the aforementioned systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.  If you are interested in receiving the RFP when it is issued please notify the contract specialist, Ms.Toni Spalding via email at toni.spalding@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Opportunity to license ORNL-patented statistical method and/or software for analysis of noisy, time-serial data in order to detect and forewarn of on-coming events in applications ranging from biomedical to industrial. 

Demonstrated biomedical applications to date include: forewarning (up to 4.5 hours) of human epileptic seizures from scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data; forewarning of ventricular fibrillations and fainting (syncope) from human electrocardiogram (ECG) data; detection of septic shock due to inhaled endotoxin from rat ECG; and detection of breathing difficulty from chest sounds (with potential application in the remote monitoring of solders, emergency responders, etc).  R&D Magazine recently announced that the EEG implementation, known as SeizAlert, is a 2005 winner of its R&D100 award. 

Demonstrated industrial applications to date include: forewarning of failures in electric motors (air-gap offset, broken rotor, turn-to-turn short, and imbalance); motor-driven components (gears, bearings, pumps [imbalance and misalignment], rotating blades, drill bit wear) using a variety of process-indicative data (torque, vibration, electrical power, voltage, current); and forewarning via time-serial stress and strain data of structural failure by cracking. 

Details of related publications and patents are located at http://computing.ornl.gov/cse_home/staff/hively.shtml.  To date, licenses have been issued in forewarning of epileptic seizures, detection of cardiovascular disease, and monitoring for prediction of cardiovascular events.  All remaining biomedical, industrial, economic/financial, and other application areas remain available for licensing. 

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through licensing of UT-Battelle’s intellectual property, and subsequent development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle and the licensee, funded by the licensee.  Such development will focus on transitioning the technology from the current laboratory demonstration stage to commercialization.  Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement.  Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and a description of the licensing and cooperative research and development process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.  No licensing intermediaries please.  This is not a procurement activity.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR R&D AND CAD/PAD TECHNOLOGIES FOR AIRCREW ESCAPE SYSTEM APPLICATIONS This is not a request for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this notice, nor will reimbursement or any other compensation be made for any costs associated with providing a response to this announcement.  The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center is seeking sources for Advanced Development of Delay Cartridge and Initiators used in various CAD/PAD Aircrew Escape System Applications.  Interested potential suppliers should submit a White Paper detailing their proposed concepts and manufacturing capabilities to incorporate very precise time delay concepts while maintaining the form, fit, and function of current fleet time delay cartridges and initiators.  Specifically, current fleet time delay cartridges utilize pyrotechnic materials to provide a specific delay once system inputs are received.  These pyrotechnic delay cartridges have time tolerances of between 8% and 25% over the aircraft required temperature range of -65° F to 200° F.  From a ! physical size perspective, a goal of this program is to develop a single concept capable of being installed in the current CCU-40A/A delay cartridge (1.095 inches long, 0.379 inches in diameter, and containing the initiation means, electronic delay circuit, and output charge).  If a potential supplier has a concept that nearly meets this physical size goal, this concept will be considered based on the minimum size and weight as offered.  In addition, these pyrotechnic time delay cartridges are time life-limited items requiring maintenance change-out at the end of their useful lifetimes.  Sources are sought to develop alternate concepts, which provide precise event timing (less than 1% tolerance over the temperature range) and longer installed lifetimes than the current pyrotechnic delay cartridges. Sources are sought for potential suppliers to present alternate concepts for the Government to review through an on-going joint USN/USAF Design Verification Test (DVT) and Service Release Test (SRT) {Qualification} program.  Successful completion of these programs will allow an efficient implementation of the selected concept(s) into fleet use.  Suppliers wishing to participate in this program must submit a White Paper to IHDIV, NSWC by 15 September 2005, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  These White Papers should detail the following elements:  (a) the basic technical concept, its pedigree, and any previously conducted functional tests, (b) the suppliers’ recommended DVT program (consisting of approximately fifty (50) cartridges of a frozen design being subjected to various aircraft environmental conditions, e.g. shock, vibration, temperature cycling), (c) the suppliers’ recommended SRT program (consisting of approximately two hundred (200) cartridges of a frozen design being subjec! ted to environmental and functional testing detailed in MIL-C-83125 – Table I). All White Papers submitted under this request shall be considered Government property and treated as “Competition Sensitive” materials.  If a contract is pursued in the future, the Government may select to negotiate for unlimited data rights for the development work.  After a complete review of the White Papers submitted under this request, the Government may choose to solicit contract proposals in October 2005.  The White Paper should be limited to not longer than ten (10) pages and should highlight the following elements: (1) technical and administrative points of contact, (2) technical summary of the concept(s) offered, (3) pedigree of the technology, (4) recommended approach to both DVT and SRT, and (5) approximate schedule to accomplish all of these elements.  For planning purposes only, fleet procurements of the final qualified delay cartridge design should be established at approximately between 500 and 2,000 cartridges per year.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Associate Chief Information Officer Telecommunications Services and Operations is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) as part of market research for a USDA integrated Information Technology (IT) and Telecommunications Managed Asset Repository System (MARS) to track, monitor, and report information on all IT assets within USDA.  In addition to the database elements, this solution must assess the security posture of all networked devices in real-time and react accordingly by engaging USDA security controls to quarantine and notify both USDA departmental personnel and the customer agency of any non-standard actions or conditions.  This activity must occur prior to accessing any USDA network assets.  USDA network assets will not be exposed to customer agency devices that introduce unacceptable risk to the department as a whole.  This solution will also remediate discovered risks where possible and apply appropriate patches/configuration changes to bring devices into compliance prior to allowing access to USDA network assets.

USDA desires a free and open discussion of all ideas and comments. All responses and information shall be in written format (MS-Word 2000, Version 9.0) and transmitted electronically to the technical point of contact in this sources sought. Comments and ideas are strongly encouraged from all sources currently operating under the General Services Administration Government –Wide Acquisition Contract(s). In addition to responses from industry, USDA encourages responses from other Federal agencies, State governments and from any source that have or plans to implement a similar system.

This SSN is for planning purposes only. The government will not be obligated to pay for this information. All vendors responding to this SSN must provide written information on their company’s ability to meet these requirements as described below.  USDA recognizes the likelihood that no single vendor can fully respond to this RFI without the inclusion of components from other vendors/providers.  Consequently, USDA requests that any references to processes/products not directly provided by the respondent be expressed in vendor-neutral terms and/or that all copyright and trademark rights be observed and declared. Telephonic inquires and responses will not be accepted.  This request in no way constitutes a request for products or services by USDA.  The results of this RFI may or may not result in any additional procurement.

USDA consists of 8 program mission areas, 29 agencies and 12 Staff offices. All program mission offices and staff offices are located in Washington, DC. USDA has approximately 14000 locations throughout the United States and Europe. There are several hundred thousand IT assets installed and operating in all these locations. The current IT environment employs a number of different solutions based on mission area as well as agency/organization based management systems.  USDA is seeking a consolidated solution for asset/system management that can be leveraged department wide.  Responses should include information on scalability, and capabilities to operate in a distributed, centralized, and multi-tiered environments.

USDA OCIO is exploring ways to implement a centralized integrated Managed Asset Repository System (MARS).  The purpose of the MARS will be to (1) monitor, track, and report the status of all IT assets on USDA networks, (2) assist USDA in management of network resources via Network Admission Control providing for near real-time security vulnerability reporting and remediation on all IT systems and networks, (3) ensure all IT assets are protected from intrusions and compromises. Through these discrete functions, MARS should provide the lowest overall total cost of ownership, and best in practice quality of service. 

In terms of functionality, USDA is seeking an integrated solution that will improve USDA’s ability to manage IT assets throughout their lifecycle.  This should include the ability to track an asset from initial acquisition through final disposal, understanding that an individual asset could see several deployments and transfers of agency ownership within this time frame. This system should combine existing data sources/functionality with new capabilities.  It should also provide a mechanism for consolidated reporting and analysis to enable an enterprise view of IT assets throughout USDA. This system should have the capability to determine the security health of internal and external USDA customer devices.  This system should provide for the subsequent routing/quarantine of those customer devices not meeting specific standards.  Also It should be flexible to meet requirements  for  different classes of internal and external customers (teleworkers, federal travelers, inside contractors, outside contractors, on-site employees, general public etc…). USDA will seek to leverage existing IT security investments within MARS.  A list of current USDA security/tracking systems is attached to assist in accomplishing this goal.
 
Requirements:

OCIO has identified 8 key areas where an integrated IT asset(s) management system could provide significant operational improvements. However, discussions/responses should not be limited to these key areas if the respondents perceive gaps in the USDA approach to overall security.  The goal is to protect USDA IT assets through the implementation of “Best Practices“ and the recognition that we will have to continue to address emerging threats.  These are high-level functional and technical requirements that should be tightly integrated into the final solution.  Wherever possible, USDA seeks enterprise wide solutions that will maximize USDA’s IT investment. Responses to these requirements should include specific details for each area and recommendations of additional requirements, if required.  

USDA is seeking a solution that will track all information necessary to provide oversight and administration of USDA’s systems.  The solution should not represent an operational or financial burden to USDA during its lifecycle.  USDA is seeking information on full lifecycle and administrative costing associated with a solution of this nature (implementation strategy and maintenance).


The requirements are; 

1.	Asset Security Management

USDA is seeking a solution that will track information regarding installed security management software (i.e. Anti-Virus, patch management, Vulnerability assessment, etc.).  Coupled with this requirement is the need to correlate between discovered security deficiencies and associated remediation strategies and the ability to automate the remediation of these deficiencies.

2.	IP Address Management,

USDA is seeking a solution that will track information associated with the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to USDA system(s)

IP Address, Machine Access Code (MAC) address, Physical Location, Point of Contact (POC), Primary/Secondary function, Agency ownership and System Configuration

3.	Software Configuration Management

USDA is seeking a solution that will track system configuration information during the full lifecycle of USDA systems; to include all installed software components present on the system (Operating Systems, application software, and communications software)

4.	Hardware Configuration Management System

USDA is seeking a solution that will track system configuration information during the full lifecycle of USDA systems, to include all installed hardware components present on the system (inventory of all hardware assets present),

5.	Network Admission Control

USDA is seeking a solution that will authenticate system configuration information during the initial connection to a USDA network.  This information will be utilized to determine if the system should be granted access to the network, placed in an isolated segment for remediation or to have its connection rejected.(agent-based client, Redefine DMZ requirements, firewall management, automated quarantine, and encryption management), 

6.	IT Cost Management

USDA is seeking a solution that will track IT investments during the full lifecycle of USDA systems, to include the ability to correlate between systems to reveal redundancy and potential cost savings. 

Monitor and audit software usage for license compliance, effectiveness and under use that will allow USDA to make the best use of its software investment.

Optimize asset deployment and increase asset utilization

Manage agreements with external and internal partners to increase the effectiveness of Service Level Agreements (SLA), contracts and acquisitions.

7.	User Configuration Management 

USDA is seeking a solution that will track user configurations on USDA systems.  This should include the ability to identify current and previous users of a specific system as well as report on improper user configuration (insufficient password, unused accounts, etc.) (Rule set management, and authentication management), 
 
8.	Device/System Security History

USDA is seeking a solution that will track security incident information during the device/system lifecycle, (obtained from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Security Information Managers (SIM), other Network Management tools, and interconnection security agreements). This solution should also track IT Security incidents from discovery through resolution. 


All information should be received by the technical point of contact, Dr. Heshmat Ansari by close of business, August 31, 2005. There is no solicitation document available to this announcement. USDA will review the submitted information prior to determining whether or not procurement activity will follow. Technical Point of Contact for this announcement is DR. Heshmat Ansari, Deputy Associate Chief Information Officer, Telecommunications Services and Operations, Email Heshmat.ansari@usda.gov. All inquires shall be through email. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Larna Palmer, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6109, Fax 202-254-6167, Email Larna.Palmer@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.	BACKGROUND. In the fall of 2005, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, DHS intends to issue a series of Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) for the research and development of systems and enabling technologies for Nuclear and Radiological Detection, Verification, and Reporting (NRDVR).  These BAAs will be designed to elicit proposals to develop transformational products that will fulfill the DNDO mission of detecting and reporting illicit attempts to import or transport nuclear material, nuclear devices, or radiological material. “Transformational” indicates products that will, when developed and implemented, radically improve the effectiveness of detection and discrimination, significantly reduce the cost of procurement and operation, and/or increase the ease of use of a detection system in an operational environment. 

The BAAs will solicit the development of technologies, components, systems and operational methodologies in each of the following topic areas: 
(A)	Distributed and Mobile Detectors for Search and Surveillance (DMDSAS): This topic area is designed to detect potential nuclear/radiological threats during intermodal transport, in fixed locations and at special localized events, utilizing distributed mobile/static/relocatable sensors.  Subtopics include:  smart personal and mobile detectors that provide spectral discrimination, directional/imaging information,  and wireless capabilities such as automatic sharing and integration of data among detectors in the same vicinity; mobile/portable detectors for standoff search that provide source/background discrimination and directional/imaging information; methodology, architecture and design for sensor networks covering distribution topology, data transfer and reach-back; and novel solutions.  

(B)	Long-Dwell Detection in Transit (LDDT):  This topic area is divided into two categories:  (1) detection systems and associated technologies that can be integrated into or attached to a cargo conveyance (vehicle, truck, cargo ship, air carrier, general aviation, etc.) or to containers shipped therein; and (2) mobile detection components, systems, and related technologies that can be integrated into various moving platforms (vehicles, marine craft, aircraft) to provide overt/covert standoff screening of suspect vehicles, boats and planes over long-dwell times with variable, relative positioning.  Subtopics include:  advanced, application-dependent neutron/photon sensors; position/location sensors; and novel solutions.  

(C)	Active Detection and Verification (ADV) of Shielded Special Nuclear Material (SSNM):  This topic area focuses on state-of-the-art active technologies for the detection and verification of shielded SNM.  Operational modes of interest include: (1) high-throughput systems at high-volume ports for resolving alarms from primary screening systems – advanced spectral and radiographic portals; (2) lower-throughput, smaller systems at low-volume ports and between ports-of-entry for primary or secondary screening applications; (3) mobile/hand-portable devices for SNM verification in maritime and land based environments.  Subtopics include:  electron/ion accelerators; photon/neutron generators; advanced radiography; prompt/fast neutron detectors; and novel solutions.  

(D)	Innovative Detector Materials (IDM):  This topic area seeks: (1) physically robust sensor component technologies that provide improved detection, identification and discrimination over existing materials; and (2) advances in manufacturing technology that lead to a reduction in fabrication costs and an increase in sensor sizes and choice of shapes without loss in performance.  The focus is on the following performance characteristics: ambient temperature operations, better efficiency, better energy resolution, faster response time, and less sensitivity to vibrations.  Subtopics include: scintillation materials; solid state charge collection materials; prompt/fast/spectral neutron detectors; and novel solutions.  

(E)	Alternate Signatures of Nuclear/Radiological Threats (ASNRT):  This topic area seeks advanced non-intrusive concepts for the detection and/or identification of nuclear/radiological materials and devices, without the direct detection of nuclear radiation.  ASNRT might utilize, for example, other properties such as mass, density, temperature, etc.  

2.	DETAILED INFORMATION SOUGHT. IN PREPARATION FOR THE NRDVR BAA, DHS IS REQUESTING FEEDBACK ON THE TOPICS LISTED IN SECTION 1 FROM ALL INTERESTED SOURCES (PRIVATE, PUBLIC, ACADEMIC, AND FEDERALLY FUNDED R&D CENTERS).   IN PARTICULAR, DHS REQUESTS EXPERT OPINION ON THE ABOVE TOPIC AND SUBTOPIC AREAS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED APPLICABILITY TO A LAYERED DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.  ADDITIONS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE TOPIC AREAS AND SUBTOPICS ARE WELCOME, BEARING IN MIND THAT DHS INTENDS THE ENTIRE SET OF TOPICS TO INCLUDE ALL TECHNICAL APPROACHES THAT WOULD BE USEFUL IN HELPING PERFORM ITS MISSION.

<DESC>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A critical need exists to acquire Construction Equipment (CE) Crew Protection Kits for the following systems (minimum and maximum quantities will be provided at time of Request for Proposal release): 	Grader 130G 	2.5 Cubic Yard Loader MW24C 	Scraper 621B					 	Tractor Full Tracked D7G/D7GwRPS		 	HYEX	 JDC230CLR					 	22 Ton Crane AT422T				 	VIB Roller CS563D	 	5 Cubic Yard Loader H100				 	HS Compactor 815F 	LRT 110 7.5 Ton Crane 	530S Pneumatic Roller			 The systems listed above are used worldwide by U.S. soldiers, with a large number currently being operated in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are extremely vulnerable as potential targets from small arms fire (7.62mm AP rounds) and improvised explosive de vices (IEDs).   Acquisition Strategy The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for up to two (2) each, five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the design, prototype build, test, production, delivery of a Level III Technical Data Package (T DP), and installation of the CE Crew Protection Kits in Iraq and Afghanistan by the selected contractor. This function can be completed by U.S. citizens or third country national, but offerors are responsible for finding people who can complete the install  in a timely and satisfactory manner, and who can get onto the installation. The design, prototypes build and test efforts are on an accelerated schedule to meet the critical need for construction equipment operator protection.  Any orders issued under a p otential contract will be system specific.  Please note that we anticipate that most of the orders will be placed during the initial two years of the 5 year IDIQ contract.  Crew Protection Kits may either be a replacement cab or an add-on kit with an A-Kit/B-Kit design. The A-Kit shall contain the permanent mounting provisions along with any vehicle modifications required to accept the armor package (e.g. suspension changes d ue to the increased weight of the armor kit).  The B-Kit shall consist of armor components that will be mounted on the vehicle to provide operator survivability.  The selected contractor may be required to have access to classified data and shall be requir ed to comply with the requirements of DOD 5220-22-M National Industrial Security Program.  The Government will use source selection procedures to select the offeror whose proposal represents the Best Value to the Government.  An offerors submission must be a complete stand-alone proposal addressing all of the RFPs requirements.  The Government reserves the right to award this contract without conducting discussions.  An offerors proposal must be comprehensive, fully responsive to the information requested in the RFP and reflect the offerors best prices. This is an accelerated acquisition.  Offerors are required to propose materials that have already been tested and approved by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to provide at least Class 3 Protection as defined in the attached Analysis of Threat Projectile s for Protection of Light Tactical Vehicles.  Offerors who are proposing the use of materials not previously tested and determined by the Government to provide this level of protection will not be evaluated.  Offerors can contact Louise Spangler at (410) 2 78-1448 or louise.spangler@dtc.army.mil                       for information on qualifying materials. Contract award is needed as soon as possible to facilitate the installation of CE Crew Protection Kits on the aforementioned systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.  If you are interested in receiving the RFP when it is issued please notify the contract specialist, Ms.Toni Spalding via email at toni.spalding@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award up to three (3), Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity, Task Order contracts starting in fiscal year 2006, subject to the availability of funds. Each basic IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five years. 

The contracts awarded under this solicitation will be performance-based, utilizing the performance metrics developed and proposed by the Contractor and negotiated with the Government. These metrics will be submitted as part of the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). 

The basic IDIQ contract will be structured to allow for the issuance of Time and Materials (T&M) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders. The estimated cost for services is approximately $200 million per five-year contract. 

This procurement is classified under the North American Industry Classification System code of 541330 (Engineering Services) with a size standard of $4.0 million. 

The selected firms will be required to provide technical assistance services, such as technical support and project management disaster-related operations under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206 (hereinafter referred to as the Stafford Act).  The program activities of the Stafford Act are highly visible and require coordination with Federal, State, and local governments and/or volunteer organizations.  The selected firms shall be required to provide the necessary resources to adequately support disaster operations throughout FEMA Regions I – X.  The Contractor shall have personnel on-site at the disaster office within 48 hours of tasking notification. Due to the nature of FEMA’s work, the Contractor must be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The selected firms will be required to provide technical expertise to perform the following services set forth in the attached Draft Scope of Work. 

Selection Criteria

The selection process will be in conformance with the provisions of Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Architect-Engineer Act. If a firm has multiple offices, for each of the criteria requiring demonstrated abilities and experience, submit project experience for each specific office and list the personnel in the office who would be assigned to perform the work. The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1 – Screening Phase, during which the SF 330 will be used to select the most highly qualified firms (the “Short List”) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

Due diligence will be held after the short-listed firms are so notified. The short-listed firms will be given the opportunity to schedule one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff as the firms are preparing their submissions for Phase 2.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these discussions will be conducted in Washington, D.C. and should not take longer than two (2) hours. Short-listed firms can make an appointment for the due diligence meetings by telephoning Gary Fontaine at (202) 646-3356.

Phase 2 – Selection Phase, during which the slated firms (selected during the Screening Phase) will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations pursuant to FAR 36.602-3(c). The oral presentation and discussions are to be conducted by the firm’s proposed management team. The additional information will consist of a comprehensive Program Management Plan (PMP), and a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), including proposed performance metrics. The package shall not exceed seventy-five (75) pages. The plans will be reviewed before oral presentations. The short-listed firms may be requested during discussions to provide further clarification concerning their submissions. After oral presentations, the firms will be re-evaluated, re-rated and re-ranked. (NOTE: In accordance with Scope of Work Paragraph 1.4.2 Open Action Report, the highest technically rated firm selected for award will be the Lead for maintenance of the program’s real-time Web reporting site).

The Selection Criteria listed below will be used for rating and ranking. Firms selected for consideration of an IDIQ contract will be notified. Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection, and will proceed until an award or awards are made. 

Five (5) factors will be used in the selection of the firms.  Criteria 1 through 4 are equally important and are more important than Criteria 5.  An unacceptable rating in any factor will result in no award.

1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE.

Cost estimates should reflect the total budget necessary for the project.  Give a detailed explanation of the reasons for any variances that exceed plus or minus 10 percent between estimated and actual costs.  

(b)  Experience in evaluating projects for compliance with environmental regulations and preparing environmental documents (environmental assessments or environmental impact statements); conducting historical or archeological reviews; complying with wetlands and endangered species regulations; reviewing insurance adjustments (all hazards and flood); and evaluating hazardous waste and debris removal issues. 

(c)  Experience in staffing at the levels in Evaluation Factor 2.

(d) Experience developing and implementing quality control measures, including an overall quality control program and implementation of quality control measures at an individual project level.

2. CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH WORK WITHIN REQUIRED TIME. The firm must demonstrate the ability to deploy, within 48 hours, the following 300 minimum personnel in the quantities specified, for an eight-month assignment, and of that number, 200 to be available for an additional four months: 

Civil Engineer (50); Structural Engineer (50); Architect (20); Construction Inspector (20); Engineering Technician (20); Estimator (20); Planner, General (15); Soils/Geotechnical Engineer (15); Environmental Planner (10); Insurance Specialist (10); Sanitary Engineer (10); GIS Specialist (5); Electrical Engineer (4); Environmental Engineer (4); Mechanical Engineer (4); Accountant (3); Architectural Historian (3); Certified Public Accountant (3); Coastal Engineer (3); Computer Specialist (3); Financial Analyst (3);  Health Scientist (3); Historical Architect (3); Landscape Architect (3); Archaeologist (2) Geologist (2); Hydrologist (2).  The firm must have one (1) each of the following skills: Appraiser; Arborist; Biologist; Chemical Engineer; Draftsman; Horticulturist; Surveying Technician; Surveyor; Telecommunications Specialist; Wetlands Specialist.

In your description of this factor, you must address how you are going to maintain staffing during the life of the contract, including whether by in-house employees or by subcontractor employees, or a combination thereof. 

3. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. The firm must demonstrate the education, experience, and professional registration/certifications, for staff listed in Evaluation Factor 2. Firms demonstrating extensive knowledge of building codes and standards, floodplain and riverine zones, and seismic and wind zones across the geographic area noted in Factor 5 will be preferred.

4. PAST PERFORMANCE. The agency will evaluate the firm’s past performance on contracts of similar size, type, and scope with Government agencies and private industry in terms of project management, accuracy of costs estimates, cost control, quality control, completion of projects within budget, and compliance with performance schedules. The firm must provide at least five contracts within the past five (5) years with names, affiliations, and telephone numbers, with a narrative discussion.  If the firm is a Joint Venture, contracts performed by its individual members must be included.  In the case of a firm without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

<CONTACT>Contractual POC: Dan Twombly, Code 112D daniel.twombly@navy.mil 301-744-6648 Technical POC: Tom Blachowski, Code 5230H thomas.blachowski@navy.mil 301-744-2362
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR R&D AND CAD/PAD TECHNOLOGIES FOR AIRCREW ESCAPE SYSTEM APPLICATIONS This is not a request for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this notice, nor will reimbursement or any other compensation be made for any costs associated with providing a response to this announcement.  The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center is seeking sources for Advanced Development of Delay Cartridge and Initiators used in various CAD/PAD Aircrew Escape System Applications.  Interested potential suppliers should submit a White Paper detailing their proposed concepts and manufacturing capabilities to incorporate very precise time delay concepts while maintaining the form, fit, and function of current fleet time delay cartridges and initiators.  Specifically, current fleet time delay cartridges utilize pyrotechnic materials to provide a specific delay once system inputs are received.  These pyrotechnic delay cartridges have time tolerances of between 8% and 25% over the aircraft required temperature range of -65° F to 200° F.  From a ! physical size perspective, a goal of this program is to develop a single concept capable of being installed in the current CCU-40A/A delay cartridge (1.095 inches long, 0.379 inches in diameter, and containing the initiation means, electronic delay circuit, and output charge).  If a potential supplier has a concept that nearly meets this physical size goal, this concept will be considered based on the minimum size and weight as offered.  In addition, these pyrotechnic time delay cartridges are time life-limited items requiring maintenance change-out at the end of their useful lifetimes.  Sources are sought to develop alternate concepts, which provide precise event timing (less than 1% tolerance over the temperature range) and longer installed lifetimes than the current pyrotechnic delay cartridges. Sources are sought for potential suppliers to present alternate concepts for the Government to review through an on-going joint USN/USAF Design Verification Test (DVT) and Service Release Test (SRT) {Qualification} program.  Successful completion of these programs will allow an efficient implementation of the selected concept(s) into fleet use.  Suppliers wishing to participate in this program must submit a White Paper to IHDIV, NSWC by 15 September 2005, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  These White Papers should detail the following elements:  (a) the basic technical concept, its pedigree, and any previously conducted functional tests, (b) the suppliers’ recommended DVT program (consisting of approximately fifty (50) cartridges of a frozen design being subjected to various aircraft environmental conditions, e.g. shock, vibration, temperature cycling), (c) the suppliers’ recommended SRT program (consisting of approximately two hundred (200) cartridges of a frozen design being subjec! ted to environmental and functional testing detailed in MIL-C-83125 – Table I). All White Papers submitted under this request shall be considered Government property and treated as “Competition Sensitive” materials.  If a contract is pursued in the future, the Government may select to negotiate for unlimited data rights for the development work.  After a complete review of the White Papers submitted under this request, the Government may choose to solicit contract proposals in October 2005.  The White Paper should be limited to not longer than ten (10) pages and should highlight the following elements: (1) technical and administrative points of contact, (2) technical summary of the concept(s) offered, (3) pedigree of the technology, (4) recommended approach to both DVT and SRT, and (5) approximate schedule to accomplish all of these elements.  For planning purposes only, fleet procurements of the final qualified delay cartridge design should be established at approximately between 500 and 2,000 cartridges per year.

<DESC>The Army is conducting studies to define the elements and components for the next generation 2.75 inch diameter rocket launcher.  The 2.75 Inch Rocket System has many different types of rockets.  (A rocket type is defined as a motor and a specific ty pe of warhead.  The entire rocket assembly is named for the warhead type.)  More types are planned and projected for future development.  Currently, one type or rocket is loaded into a specific set of tubes in the launcher, called a zone.  Each zone can on ly handle one type of rocket at a time.  The future rocket launcher will be capable of firing both new rockets as well as current stocks of MK66 motors.  In order to achieve maximum flexibility for loading, it is desired that the launcher be able to fire a ny type of rocket loaded into any tube at any time.  Ideally, the loaders will place any rocket in any tube, in a random fashion, and the system will detect and determine the rocket type.  This concept is called a zoneless launcher, or infinite zoning.   Automatic identification is seen as a means whereby sensors attached to each tube will read a signature tag, or an identifying mark, on each rocket and determine its type.  This will be similar to barcode scanning at a retail checkout.  This informatio n will be stored and used by the onboard Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA) for tube selection during a fire mission.  Examples of possible technologies that may be applicable to the Automatic Identification (Auto-ID) requirement include, but are not limi ted to: bar codes and readers, Radio Frequency Identification tags and readers, 2-D matrix and readers.  Other technologies and approaches can be considered.  In all cases, the identification process will take place after all rockets are loaded, and at the  time that the aircraft crew turns on the weapons system power and energizes the LEA.  This may occur several times during a single mission.  Auto-ID may also be used to determine if rockets remain in the tubes after an attempt has been made to fire.  The general requirements and operating environment for the Auto-ID are as follows: - The reader, or reading head, must fit between the tubes.  This is defined as the space between three tubes, with outside diameters of 2.93 inches, arrange so that their centers form an equilateral triangle, 3.03 inches on a side.  See the attached drawin g from the launcher Technical Data Package.  It is provided to illustrate the area available between tubes for a reading head. - There is to be one reader head per tube. - The reader head may be up to 12 inches in length. - The maximum distance from the read head to the signature tag will be .060 inches, (1.5mm). - A window in the side of the tube may be use to allow the reader to see the identifying marking.  The window material will be transparent in the spectrum that the reader works in.  The window material must be able to work in a high heat environment wi thout losing transparency; the reader head must be able to see through scratches and dirt that will appear as rockets are loaded and fired. - The reader must be able to operate in a temperature range of -50oF to 140oF.  It must also be able to survive brief temperature excursions up to 500oF. - The reader head must operate in the launcher high vibration environment. - The signature tag (e.g. barcode or similar item) must not add significantly to the rocket diameter. - The tag must be readily applicable to existing and future stocks of rockets with a minimum of equipment. - The tag must not require power, other than possibly the stimulus from the reader head (such as the case with RFID tags). - The tag must work when applied to any material that may be part of the rocket, to include the metal motor case or the metal warhead, and it must be readable by the selected reader head when the rocket is inside the aluminum launch tube. - Since the rocket may be randomly oriented in roll (sometimes even rotating d uring pre-fire carriage), the tag will rarely be directly under the reader head; therefore readability must be independent of the rocket roll orientation (Placing several ID tags around the rocket is acceptable.).  - While repackaging of the reader head to fit within the allotted volume is likely, to the greatest extent possible, the device should use off-the-shelf components. - The reader must be able to accurately read and interpret the ID signature even when the launcher window and rocket ID tag are smeared with rocket exhaust residue and oily bore cleaner. - The signature tag must be durable, sustaining a minimum of 129 flight hours and 50 rocket firings, per tube, without loss of readability or reliability. - The Auto-ID sub-system must have a probability of an accurate reading in excess of .999 at all times and in all conditions. - The reading head must function in an electromagnetically noisy environment without degradation. - The Auto-ID sub-system must not produce any signals that will interfere with other systems in the launcher or on the platform aircraft.  The Auto-ID subsystem must not produce any external signature detectable more than 10 feet from the aircraft under an y circumstances.   - The Auto-ID solution should utilize low cost technology for this unique application, since there will be up to 19 units in a single launcher. Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper compatible with Microsoft Word containing a description of appropriate technologies that they possess, or are conducting, and how these technologies could be applied to this project.  Drawing s/sketches of the reader heads shall be submitted on CD.   Responses should be made within forty five (45) days from publication of this notice.

In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, a nd sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Government is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it will have to open up its MILCON Program to multiple different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughou t the United States by private industry.  Industry recommended that USACE utilize industry best practices, standards and codes.  Industry recommended that the Government utilize performance based type contracts versus its current prescriptive contracts tha t identify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, and when each phase of the construction will be completed.  Industry stated that non-traditional construction methods such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized o r Tilt-up Walls, and Permanent Modular Construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in order to meet the needs of the Army.   Industry also stated that it could achieve cost savings through bulk buys if awarded more than  one of the same type of facility.  Based on this national market research, the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers has developed an execution model that it believes will achieve the cost savings and time efficiency sought by the Army, achieve economi es of scale and also provide multiple opportunities for small business participation.  Instead of executing large construction contracts for each Brigade, our execution model provides for a Land Development Engineering firm to design the overall infrastruc ture and serve in a site integrator role; and for the facility types to be executed under separate single and/or multiple award IDIQ design build contracts in what is referred to as product lines.  In order to explain this approach, the Government will hol d an Industry Day Forum in El Paso.  This Industry Day, in addition to the market research questionnaire, is necessary in order for the Government to determine whether or not the market has the capability and capacity to execute this potentially multi-bill ion dollar program over the next five years.  In order to facilitate Industry understanding of this approach prior to the Industry Day, the Southwestern Division has placed a MS power point presentation on the Fort Worth District Contracting Divisions hom e page http://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil .  Additionally, the Southwestern Division requests that you complete the questionnaire (also found on this website) and provide your responses to the below POC by close of business August 5, 2005.   INPUT IS DESIRED FR OM ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.  THIS INCLUDES CONTRACTORS, INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS OR SOCIETIES.  This Construction Program will consist of Mission Facilities for the Army (Barracks, Dining Facilities, Headquarters Buildings, Company Operations Fa cilities, Tactical Operations Facilities, Unit Storage, Ammo Storage, Paving/Roads & Parking, Aviation Operation Facilities, Classrooms, Training Ranges) as well as community facilities for the Families (Child Development Centers, Chapels, Fitness Faciliti es, etc.) to support the MILCON Transformation at Ft. Bliss.  All buildings are to be considered permanent and shall have a life span of approximately 25 years. THIS PROGRAM IS NOT RESTRICTED AND IS OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION UNDER  NAICS CODES 236  Construction of Buildings (236116, 117, 118, 210, 220); 237  Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (237110, 120, 130, 210); 238  Specialty Trade Contractors (238110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 190, 210, 220, 290, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 390, 910, 990); 541  Professional and Technical Services (541310, 320, 330, 410, 490).

<DESC>The Northern Region Contracting Center-Leavenworth, KS, is seeking sources among GSA contract holders capable of designing a non-proprietary After Action Review (AAR) system for the Army Constructive Training Federation (ACTF) for US Army and Joint t raining users.  For purposes of this requirement, non-proprietary means the government has unlimited rights as defined in DFARS 252.227-7014 as rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display or disclose computer software documentation in whol e or in part, in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.  The primary purpose is to support the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) and the Army Battle Simulation Centers (BSCs).  While BCTP and the BSCs have  similar requirements, the data used and the display of the simulation information varies.  Generally, BCTP requires more data-intensive information designed for detailed analysis while the BSCs require a more broad analysis for their customers.  The contr actor shall support both paradigms within the same baseline.  The BCTP support shall be focused on the Division and higher warfighter and Mission Rehearsal Exercises.  The contractor may, while developing the proposal for this effort, utilize other AAR pro ducts developed under government contracts (and for which the government has acquired unlimited or government purpose rights) as a baseline for development, embedded, or included as part of the new AAR system.   The Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code  for this requirement is R412 and NAICS code is 541690.  Responses shall include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, GSA contract number, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE Code.  All contra ctors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr.  ALL RESPONSES MUST REFERENCE W91QF4-5210-NA01 AND MUST BE RECEIVED NLT 1200 hours, CDT, 5 Aug 05.

<SUBJECT>67 -- Minirhizotron Camera System
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, High Plains Grasslands Research Station, Cheyenne, Wyoming, intends to enter into a single source contract with Bartz Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, California, for the purchase of a High Magnification Minirhizotron Camera System.  This is a high resolution color camera with S-VHS output designed for outdoor use in a 2 inch (51 mm) tube with remote zoom to observe objects up to 100 times original size, and includes a Smucker Indexing Handle System allowing precise camera location in a 2-inch inside diameter tube and Image Capture System, which captures, names and stores digital images in the field, directly from camera head to field computer for later lab analysis, including control software, image management software, sub-notebook field computer installed in fieldcase, field power system and recharger.  This system will be used to quantify root growth in a field global change experiment in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency's Nevada FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment)Project, which is currently using a Bartz Minirhizotron Camera System.  The ability to compare results with images being taken at the Nevada experiment is required.  It is critical in such cross-site experiments to utilize the same equipment or differences between experimental results  can be attributed to different technologies.  This system will also be used in a project conducted on a shortgrass prairie in Colorado using a Bartz minirhizotron camera system and compare results from an experiment conducted on Wyoming mixed-grass prairie.  Comparisons will be severely compromised if the same type of camera technology used in Colorado is not used in Wyoming.  *Provide Qualification Statement by Close of Business August 11, 2005, if interested in this procurement.

<SUBJECT>V -- Support Vessel, Remotely Operated Vehicle, Scientific and Laboratory Support for Monterey  Bay National Marine Sanctuary Research
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, on a sole source basis with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).  In early 2006, two expeditions will be mounted - to the Davidson Seamount and to the site of the wreck of the USS Macon dirigible.  On these expeditions, scientists will study coral environments and population characteristics of corals; make high definition video of corals; document features of the dirigible wreck site; record details about specific artifacts; and assess environmental hazards and biological activity around the wreck.  After conclusion of the cruise, the contractor will analyze data, and develop a video program.  The contractor will provide the vessel and ROV, and scientists to participate in the research.  The Government intends to negotiate solely with this contractor.  Scientists from MBARI have participated in past cruises to the seamount and wreck site and have unique knowledge of the locations themselves, as well as of past research performed.  MBARI vessels - support and ROV - are the only vessels which have worked these locations so their crews have a unique familiarity with operating conditions and limitations.  MBARI has a shore based laboratory which will be used to analyze all video tapes from the cruises.  This organization has done this analysis in the past, so having this work done by another source could result in inconsistency of data.  The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract.  This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.  See Numbered Note 22.     NAICS Code is 483112.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any interested concern which believes it can satisfy this requirement should send a qualifying statement to this office by 10 August 2005.

Background

The Program Operations Specialist requires experience working in government, an international organization, or a business setting, with responsibilities related to procurement, human resources, or other administrative services.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-8514), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for this requirement. This is the Request for Proposals. No other solicitation will be issued.
The provisions and clauses incorporated into this document are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03.     
This will be a fixed price contract for the identification and elimination of potential and real fire and safety hazards in the Mine Simulation Laboratory located at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy, located in Beaver, West Virginia.  
This will be a fixed price contract with the Contract Line Items and to be proposed in the contractor’s proposed Statement of Work, in accordance with the Statement of Objectives,
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES This Statement of Objectives (SOO) provides the high-level requirements for the Mine Simulation Laboratory  (MSL) project. Offerors shall use the SOO, together with all other applicable portions of the RFP, as the basis for preparing their proposal, including a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), detailed Statement of Work (SOW) and list of deliverables.  The offeror shall ensure that all aspects of the SOO are addressed.  The SOW should specify in clear, understandable terms the work to be done in order to meet all applicable fire and safety standards at the MSL.  Preparation of an effective SOW requires both an understanding of the requirements of this acquisition, as well as the ability to define what is required in specific, performance-based, quantitative terms.  The offerors understanding of the requirement and the effort required to accomplish it should be fully demonstrated in the offeror’s proposed CWBS, SOW and list of deliverables.  Upon contract award the SOO will be augmented by the vendor-provided Performance Work Statement (PWS  
OVERVIEW The Mine Safety and Health Administration’s (MSHA) mission is to reduce accidents and improve health conditions in the mining industry through education and training.  To further this mission, MSHA operates a Mine Simulation Laboratory (MSL) at the Mine Health and Safety Academy, located in Beaver, West Virginia.  The National Mine Academy Mine Simulation Lab and Burn Pad is a unique training facility that is used to train mine rescue teams and Federal mine inspectors. The MSL is contained in a pre-engineered steel building with concrete slab on grade floors, supported by spread foundations.  This structure houses two levels of large simulated mine entries built of plywood.  The tunnels can be ventilated with a large mine fan and smoke machines can introduce realistic mine fire simulations.  In addition to the simulated mine entries, the MSL building contains some traditional classroom space and a large open area.  Additionally, materials for simulating mining equipment and other mine structures are either stored or in place in the MSL building.  These simulated structures and equipment are made primarily of wood.  Attached to the MSL is a small brick and steel structure referred to as the Burn Building.  There is a fire pad adjacent to the Mine Simulation Lab.  This is a large cement area with pans, metal tunnels and various equipment stations.  All of these stations can be put ablaze using mineral spirits or propane allowing trainees to extinguish realistic fire scenarios.  MSHA had an evaluation of the MSL conducted by an independent engineering firm.  This evaluation contained serious concerns for compliance with recognized fire and safety standards. These concerns included:  
1. Extent of flammable materials in the facility. 
2.  Inadequate fire suppression.  
3.  Egress deficiencies the deficiencies include but not limited to four 2nd floor exits (one at each corner of the 2nd level mine).  These exits must include substantial platforms to handle complete rescue teams, fire brigades, etc. and their apparatus and gear.  Improve the steps, platform, and lighting at the existing exit. The back exits could lead to existing outside exit doors on the 1st level.   
4.  Fire alarm deficiencies. These deficiencies must include sight and sound alarms particularly in the internal mine simulation gallery.  The alarm must include appropriate emergency shut off facility (mine fan, smoke generator, etc.) and turn on emergency lighting   
5.  Emergency lighting deficiencies.  
 6.  Storage of materials both temporary and permanent. This section outlines information that will help you prepare your response to the MSHA request for proposal.  It is intended to help you understand MSHA’s objectives when taken in conjunction with the other information that has been provided.  

The Offeror is expected to:

 1  Review those portions of the previous study report relative to the Mine Simulation Lab (attached)

2.  Conduct an inspection of the facility paying particular attention to previously identified problems.

3.  Familiarize themselves with operational procedures including the use and storage of any flammable materials.

4.  Develop options for rectifying these deficiencies considering:

Cost effectiveness,
Best business practices,
Selecting solutions that retain the maximum utilization of the facility,
Minimizing program interruption.

These options can include destruction/construction, fireproofing, new materials, operational practices, and improved equipment and systems.  Options must also:  
1.  Following MSHA approval,  implement appropriate modifications, installations, and construction. 
2.  The vendor shall prepare a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Statement of Work, list of deliverables, and schedule for the completion of the task. 
3.  At a minimum the deliverables shall include a management plan, work schedule and a quality control plan

Each offeror must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions herein. Proposals must respond to and meet all of the mandatory requirements of this solicitation. Failure to meet any mandatory requirement may be cause for rejection of an offer without further consideration.     When evaluating an offeror, the Government will consider how well the offeror complied with both the letter and intent of these instructions.     The Government will consider any failure on the part of an offeror to comply with both the letter and spirit of these instructions to be an indication of the performance it can expect during task order performance. Clarity and completeness of the proposal are of the utmost importance. The proposal must be written in a practical, clear and concise manner. It must use quantitative terms whenever possible and must avoid qualitative adjectives to the maximum extent possible. Proposal volumes must be internally consistent or the proposal will be considered unrealistic and may be considered unacceptable.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 TO SOLICITATION 223-05-3000

(FOR ORIGINAL SOLICITATION, PLEASE SEARCH UNDER BOTH ACTIVE AND ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS.)

THE DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS IS EXTENDED TO JANUARY 14, 2005 AT 4:00 PM

Solicitation 223-05-3000 is amended as follows:

1.	In Paragraph III.  SCOPE OF WORK, Subparagraph 4., Glossary, the following definitions are added:

Continuous:  Uninterrupted in time, sequence, substance, or extent.  In the case of an enrollment – or eligibility-based products, this would translate to the cohort of individuals with uninterrupted enrollment for a two-year period.  In the case of a non-enrollment- or non-eligibility-based data resources, the Offeror would be expected to provide an estimate of individuals with continuous pharmacy activity over a two year period.  FDA realizes that due to the nature of the source of data for these resources, this may be an approximation, and not as precise as the results for eligibility- or enrollment-based information.  FDA expects the Offeror to described in detail how this value is calculated, including assumptions and limitations of the result, and to cite appropriate references from the literature where necessary.

Churn rate: This is the term used to describe the same concept as a turnover rate, but in a system that is not eligibility-based.  If the offeror's data resource is not eligibility-based (e.g., if it is pharmacy-based), the Offeror is expected to estimate the ratio of the number of individuals who no longer are actively filling prescriptions to the total number of individuals who are actively filling prescriptions over the course of a calendar year.  FDA recognizes that due to the nature of the data resource, this will be an approximation.  FDA expects the Offeror to describe in detail how this rate was calculated, including assumptions and limitations of the result, and to cite appropriate references from the literature where necessary.

Turnover rate: This is a way to describe the yearly inflow and outflow of individuals within an eligibility-based data resource.  Generally, calculation of the turnover rate requires knowledge of the total number of eligible individuals (i.e., those covered by insurance) in the data resource over the course of a defined period of time.

2.	Paragraph VII.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS, the date for receipt of technical and business proposals is changed to January 14, 2005 at 4:00 PM.

3.	The following additional information is provided:

Question 1:  Is the purpose of the sample data test period to:  1) become familiar with the data (i.e., to assess and become familiar with data variables within a market), or 2) to identify the longitudinal nature of the data (more data months over time)?	

Response:  FDA requests access to the full, commercially available database to get a realistic idea of what will be involved in integrating the Offeror’s data resource into the current FDA functions.  Our goal is to understand how to use and interpret the data through running some sample queries.

Question 2:  For the purposes of the providing unlimited access to data, can it be assumed that the number of users at any given time will be ten?  Or is this an underestimation of the possible activity level?

Response:  As stated in the RFP, FDA requires a site license, or a licensing agreement that is not dependent on a specific number of users.  If the Offeror’s data resource is configured in such a way that there are limitations on the number of simultaneous or total users, the Offeror should clearly explain how this configuration is implemented ant the nature of these limitations.  The Offeror should also describe in detail FDA’s options for adding or reducing the total number of users during the contract period.

Question 3:  Can data access be approached in a variety of ways (i.e., Microstrategy tool, SAS datasets, etc.)?

Response:  FDA currently uses the Microsoft Office Suite of tools as well as SAS as part of our standard desktop.  If access to the data resource requires additional front-end software (such as Microstrategy) or hardware this should be clearly explained in the Offeror’s response.  FDA is willing to consider multiple access options as long as they conform to the technical requirements listed in the RFP.

Question 4:  How many markets are required of the RFP?  All?  Top 25?  Other?

Response:  FDA will require access to the entire data resource.  If the data resource is in the form of “cubes” or “markets”, FDA will require access to all of them.

Question 5:  How often are the database updates required?  Monthly?   Other?

Response:  FDA expects the Offeror to explain in their technical proposal how often the database is updated.

Question  6:  Regarding Paragraph III.2.9 – would FDA be willing to execute a non-disclosure agreement  before release of an offeror’s data dictionary.

Response:  Due to the time constraints associated with this procurement, FDA would need to hold off signing a  non-disclosure agreement.  However, after award FDA would be agreeable to submitting the non-disclosure agreement to our legal department for review and approval prior to signing.

Question 7:  (A)  Regarding Paragraph VI.1.B. – Short term trial subscription at no cost. What are the criteria for choosing vendors for this trial?  
(B)	Would a single, best and final vendor be chosen or would a number of vendors provide this trail subscription?  
(C)	 Because of the complexity of the data and the potential queries that FDA might want to perform, training and support will be required.  Would the FDA consider less expensive options such as access to a smaller, representative sample of the data? 
(D)	Prior to the trial training session, would the FDA be willing to submit the sample queries that they would like to obtain?  This would allow more focused training.

Response:  (A)  The minimum mandatory requirements are the criteria for choosing vendors for the trial subscription. 
(B)	Those vendors who meet the minimum mandatory requirements will be selected to provide a trial subscription.  This could be a number of vendors.  
(C)	As stated in the RFP, FDA is only interested in accessing the full, currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant, out-patient and patient level prescription data via secure Internet or network-based methods to a maximum of four FDA researchers for the trial subscription for evaluation purposes. 
(D)	The training should address how to access, navigate, and retrieve reports and/or downloads from the product.  Offerors should be prepared to demonstrate during training how the product can be used to address queries concerning trend and volume in drug utilization, and how to characterize that information by demographic factors.”

(FOR ORIGINAL SOLICITATION, PLEASE SEARCH UNDER BOTH ACTIVE AND ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS.)

Solicitation 223-05-3000 is amended as follows:

1.	The following additional information is provided:

<DESC>This amendment shall ADD Attachment No. 1 into Solicitation No. GS-00P-05-CY-0156:

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (Q & A)
Attachment No. 1
Date:  July 29, 2005

Q1:  For Evaluation Factor III, the category states that this factor is worth 20%.  So are questions A and B both worth 10% instead of the 5% listed? 

A1:  Yes.  The change has been incorporated in Amendment No. 3.

Q2:  "Small businesses shall indicate which key service areas they wish to be considered for award under."  Could you please confirm that small businesses can state in their proposal, they wish to be consider for award for either commissioning, construction management, and/or project development (thus limiting their technical offer to just that area)?  

A2:  The scope of these contracts is nationwide and must support all indicated services. Awards will not be made to contractor firms/joint ventures/consultant teams who can not collectively support all indicated services.  It is understood that one firm (even large business firms who would compete for the unrestricted contract awards) will NOT embody all the resources/expertise that is required to perform all services.  Joint Venture scenarios, or subcontractor alliances are a given.  As with any contract, a single lead firm must assume coordination responsibilities for the contractor team firms involved.  That could be your firm or some other firm. 

To be considered for the Small Business set-aside awards, all team member firms who would perform the “Key Services” of “Commissioning,” “Construction Management,” and professional A-E services for “Project Development” (i.e. project planning) must be Small Business firms.  That said, specialty program area consultant firms that could support the Small Business set-aside key-service firms, may be Large Business; as might be required in dealing with program specialty interests such as security, geotechnical, sustainability, etc.    

Q3:  I have been asked to the review the technology requirements for the above referenced projects. I am wondering if there is any additional information available for the Dr. Checks software program. I reviewed the information on the Web Site, but there really is no detailed information. Is there any possibility that there is a demonstration of the software that we could review?

A3:  Contact representatives from the Corps of Engineers, e.g. Mr. William East, or Mr. Jeff Kirby, on (217) 373-6730 to obtain more information, access, and perhaps training that relates to their DrChecks software.  Certain information is also available through the Internet (e.g. http://www.buildersnet.org/drchecks/training/) 

Q4:  If the size standard is in fact $6M, it is difficult to imagine a small business with a nationwide each and having 11 offices near the GSA Regional Centers.  Does the GSA intend for the “prime” Small Businesses to cover a few of these areas and let their team members cover the rest or does the GSA expect to award contracts to Small Businesses to serve only specific regions? 

A4:  Note that the four anticipated Small Business Set-Aside contract awards are not set for a maximum ordering limitation of $6,000,000/year – The Small Business contracts would have a maximum ordering limitation of $3,000,000/year.  Only the anticipated 4 “unrestricted” contract awards would be at $6,000,000/year. 

It is understood that one firm (even many large business firms that would compete for the unrestricted contract awards) will NOT embody all the resources/expertise that is required to perform all services, in all areas of the country.  Joint Venture scenarios, or subcontractor alliances are a given.  As with any contract, a single lead firm must assume coordination responsibilities for the contractor team firms involved.  That could be your firm or some other firm. 

Q5:  How does the GSA intend to award task orders to the eventual successful contractors?  Will every task order over $2,500 be offered to all 8 firms to “bid” upon or will task orders be offered to an individual contractor with costs negotiated?   

A5:  When multiple contract awards involve the same scope of services, such as involved with this procurement, individual work orders can be competed for technical qualifications – e.g. the experience/past performance of proposed team members.  Price will not usually be a factor in choosing from among competing firms.  After selecting the most qualified firm, a fee negotiation will take place, based upon agreed-to level of effort.  Respectfully, all task orders will be awarded in accordance with the Fair Opportunities Act (FAR 16.505), procedures established by the Brooks Act and FAR Subpart 36.6.

 
Q6:  In the second paragraph under Description and also under the heading “Business Size Standard” it appears to state that Small Businesses can prepare proposals to provide only one of the Key Services listed.  Does this mean that we may focus on one or two services in which we are strong? Does this mean that if we, as prime, are strong in only two services (as an example), we do not have to provide qualifications in all of the areas? Please clarify.  If it is permissible to submit on 2 of the 3 “Key Services,” may we only provide resumes for the applicable disciplines?

A6:  The scope of these contracts is nationwide and must support all indicated services.  Awards will not be made to contractor firms/joint ventures/consultant teams who can not collectively support all indicated services.  It is understood that one firm (even large business firms who would compete for the unrestricted contract awards) will NOT embody all the resources/expertise that is required to perform all services.  Joint Venture scenarios, or subcontractor alliances are a given.  As with any contract, a single lead firm must assume coordination responsibilities for the contractor team firms involved.  That could be your firm or some other firm. 

Q7:  Please clarify that there are only three key service areas, Commissioning, Construction Management, and Project Development. If this is the case, how will the “Expert Professional Services” be considered relative to source selection?

A7:  Reference to the thee key service areas are intended to emphasize the general categories of service activities involved with these contracts AND to help distinguish the requirements associated with the 4 anticipated Small Business Set-Aside contract awards.  

To be considered for the Small Business set-aside awards, all team member firms who would perform the “Key Services” of “Commissioning,” “Construction Management,” and professional A-E services for “Project Development” (i.e. project planning) must be Small Business firms.  That said, specialty program area consultant firms that could support the Small Business set-aside key-service firms, may be Large Business; as might be required in dealing with program specialty interests such as security, geotechnical, sustainability, etc.

Selection of firms either for the 4 Small Business set-aside contracts or the 4 “unrestricted” contracts will be based upon the evaluation factors reflected within the FedBizOpps advertisement.  While significant weight will be associated with the qualifications available to perform Key Services, the ability of contractors to offer qualified specialty service contractors will also be considered.

Q8:  Do the successful contractors need to have professionally licensed architects and engineers with registrations that cover all 50 states in all required disciplines, or is it sufficient to simply have professionally licensed architects and engineers in at least one state for all required disciplines?  

A8:  It is only required that involved contractor team members be registered in one state.

Q9:  Was wondering if you are planning on selecting 4 Small Business Contractors and 4 Large Business Contractors for the GSA Building Commissioning IDIQ contract. Could you please let me know?

A9:  It is currently anticipated that 4 Small Business contract awards and 4 unrestricted contract awards will be made.  Only in the case where more or less numbered firms be considered “most qualified” would a reconsideration be made as to whether 4 firms would be selected in each category.

Q10:  I understand that there are three key service areas in the solicitation: Commissioning, Construction Management, and Project Development.  I also noted the Building Science Disciplines related to Expert Professional Services. 
 
a)	Could you clarify “Expert Professional Services” Are they all the other services listed except commissioning? 

b)	Are “Expert Professional Services” a fourth key service/requirement, or are they services performed within the scope of the three key service areas? If so, would an example of “Expert Professional Services” be:  performing a feasibility study pertaining to the Building Science Disciplines (sustainability, blast resistance, seismic safety, etc.) — a Project Development key service; providing commissioning services for a system designed based on the feasibility study — a Commissioning key service; and schedule control for construction for this system — a Construction Management key service?

A10:  a)	Expert Professional Services characterizes the nature of these contracts in that all proposed disciplines should be considered expert.  There may be a need to have technical specialty experts available to support the planning of a project, or its commissioning, or its construction management.

b)	Expert Professional Services are not a 4th Key Service area – It is a characterization of the qualifications expected by those who support this contracts.  It also suggests specialty areas of expertise, such as those you listed.  

Q11:  Are the various services listed under “Deliverables” a further detailing of the services to be provided under the three key service areas? For example: are the services listed under Criteria/Policy Development Services and Planning Stage (Pre-Design Services) examples related to the Project Development key service”?  

A11:  The Deliverables heading is intended to provide examples of products associated with these IDIQ contracts.  The three key service areas have some relationship to these deliverables, but should not be characterized as a structured sub-set: e.g. The IDIQ contract might have a work order to prepare a Program Development Study (PDS) - A PDS is part of the planning stage of a project (Project Development).  The IDIQ contract might also contract for Design Review Services:  This may be work that is packaged into CM or Commissioning services, or it can just be an isolated service.  In this latter case, we may want to hire your team’s experts to review critical program goals/design features to insure attention to particular program goals.    

Q12:  Will commissioning services be a component of every project, or will some projects just utilize project development or construction management services?

A12:  While GSA policy indicates that Building Commissioning will be associated with all its capital construction projects, these IDIQ contracts may be used for any professional service (except design).  So, yes – if only project development or construction management services were needed, the IDIQ contract’s work order would limit the scope to just those services.

Q13:  We have seen projects with “Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc)” services where third party commissioning services are part of the CMc contract. Will this practice continue for certain projects?  Or, might third party commissioning services be accessed for these projects through this solicitation?

A13:  Using a CMc contractor to coordinate commissioning is not generally recommended/ appropriate due to a potential conflict of interest.  These IDIQ contracts can offer third party commissioning services for CMc delivery methods, or any type of delivery method.  

Q14:  Can firms/teams selected through this solicitation bring on specialized subconsultants as needed for a specific project, or do all disciplines need to be addressed in the solicitation response? 

A14:  If very specialized areas of expertise become necessary, then provisions within the IDIQ contract will enable their involvement by either incorporating the firm into the IDIQ contracts fee schedules (if an ongoing relationship is indicated), or as a direct cost add-on (noted as a “specialty consultant.”)  For solicitation’s indicated areas of expertise, team member representation is expected as a factor in considering overall qualifications.

Q15:  The notice states, under Description: "Of the 8 potential awards, 4 will be unrestricted, inviting any combination of large and small business ventures. The remaining 4 awards will be 100% small business set-asides for key building services, such as commissioning, project development services, and construction management." Are all 8 awards expected to offer the referenced key building services, or only the Small Business Awards?

A15:  All 8 contract awards will have the same scope.  All 8 contracts will involve all key services.  The distinction related to small business set-asides is that we want all the key service activities to be primarily supported by small businesses, not enabling a small firm to broker work to larger firms.  However, expert professional services (specialty consultants), such as blast resistance, geotechnical engineering, workplace performance, etc. may be supported by large businesses even for the small business set-aside contracts.

Q16:  The notice states, under Description of Services: "The Contractors shall plan, schedule, coordinate and ensure the full, effective, efficient and economical performance of all services stated below". However, the notice also states, under Business Size Standard: "Small businesses shall indicate which key service areas they wish to be considered for award under." Does GSA intend to award all (8) contracts to offerers who have full services capabilities, or 4 awards to large firms with full service capabilities and 4 awards to small businesses with limited service area capabilities?

A16:  All 8 contracts will be the same except for ordering limitation.  All 8 contracts must be able to support nationwide work for all indicated services.  It is expected that in order to support this nationwide focus, small business joint ventures or other business arrangements will be needed to offer nationwide services.

Q17:  Are offerers required to indicate which primary NAICS Code(s) they wish to be awarded under?

A17:  No.  However, you do need indicate which set of contract awards you wish to be considered, i.e. small business or unrestricted. 

Q18:  Is this solicitation a recompetition of an existing contract, or a totally new procurement? 

A18:  This procurement can be aligned in scope with a set of 5 national IDIQ contracts that GSA awarded six years ago.  However, this solicitation is more specific in emphasizing required specialty areas of expertise and in its emphasis to commissioning.  The maximum ordering limitations of the unrestricted contracts are also higher than were provided earlier.  And, the division of awards between small business and unrestricted awards is new.

Q19:  For Section F, how many projects can be submitted under this section.  Is it 10 projects for the Prime and a 10 projects for each of the subconsultants? Or is it 10 TOTAL projects for the entire team? 

A19:  It can be 10 projects for each involved firm, if you wish.  Just make sure that the pictures represented are cleanly characterized as to which firm is associated with the involved project.

Q20:  Would one be penalized for using the facing page within the SF 330 form to add project photos? 

 
20:  No.

Q21:  We are a full service Construction Management Firm that provides Commissioning       Services and we have revenues less than the NACS code 233320 small biz standard of $28.5 million annual revenues.   Can we lead a team as a prime contractor and be a small business set aside?

A21:  Yes, as long as other team members who are associated with the three key services are also small business.  Large business firms may be a subcontractor to the 4 small business set-aside contracts only if providing specialized consulting support, such as for blast/risk analysis, geotechnical engineering, etc.

Q22:  In addition to 6 copies of the Form 330, Parts 1 and 2, is there any additional documentation that is required at this time? In other words, do we need to submit information to address evaluation criteria I through IV?

A22:  You need to respond to the solicitation, using Form 330, and you need to address all evaluation factors.  Example documentation of work completed is not required and not wanted in the first phase of selection.  

Q23:  Do I understand correctly that 4 of the contracts will be awarded to most likely multi-office firms that qualify as Small Businesses and then these 4 firms will compete for the many individual Task Orders that will represent the actual work to be performed under the contracts?

A23:  At this time, 8 contract awards are anticipated:  4 for small business and 4 unrestricted.  When these IDIQ contracts are awarded, should the involved Government Contracting Officer determine that a proposed work order should be competed, then technical qualifications of proposed team members from similar IDIQ contracts can be the basis of selecting which will be assigned the work order.  

There are reasons why a Government Contracting Officer may decide to only go to a single IDIQ contractor – such as continuation of work, avoiding minimum order limitations, etc. – but it is up to the involved Contracting Officer to make that call.

Q24:  May a large business submit as a single entity Prime; as a joint venture partner with another large business; AND as a subconsultant to a Small Business and be eligible for contract award under ANY AND ALL scenarios without exclusion?

A24:  A large business firm may not be part of a small business IDIQ contract team if that large business will function in providing the three indicated key service areas: Project Development, Commissioning, and Construction Management.  A large business may be a small business consultant only if providing specialty services, e.g. blast resistance, geotechnical engineering, diagnostics testing, etc.

A firm, either large or small business, may align itself with other competing contract entities, subject to the paragraph above.  The Government does not limit such alliances.  Aside:  It is sometimes the case that prime firms want all their involved joint-venture/consultant firms to sign “exclusivity agreements,” to better their marketing approach, but this has nothing to do with the Government’s interests. 

Q25:  If a large business is considering submitting in Joint Venture with another large business, does GSA want a combined SF330 or one SF330 for each company?  The joint venture in this scenario is not an established legal entity.

A25:  Submit a single SF 330, indicating the contract relationships that exists between all parties.  An entity must be recognized as having a legal basis to represent all parties involved. 

Q26:  Please clarify Evaluation Factor III-Professional Qualifications. It is incomplete in the solicitation.

A26:  The solicitation should read…Factor III:     Professional Qualifications (Total: 20%).
(A) Does the proposed team commit the relevant key individuals in each discipline area with the professional qualifications in understanding state of the art technologies, necessary for this contract? (10%); 
(B) Does the proposed team commit the relevant key individuals in each discipline area with the experience in understanding state of the art technologies, necessary for this contract? (10%)

The first sub-evaluation factor addresses knowledge, while the second addresses experience.  While fundamentally related, this structure allows additional credit for those teams who have been actively involved in providing involved services and achieving program goals, vs. those who know what is involved but have little experience.  

Q27:  Does GSA want specific small, small disadvantaged and small women-owned business concerns identified with individual SF330 documentation or is our track record of their participation in our past performance all that is required to maximize point qualifications under Factor II.

A27:  If you are talking about indicating past use of small, small disadvantaged and small women-owned business, then your track record is sufficient.  If you are incorporating such firms into the mix of professional service providers, then you need to address each firm’s qualifications – relating to the evaluation factors.

Q28:  Can a large firm qualify as a prime for one of the unrestricted contract awards, while also supporting a Small Business set-aside as a specialty subcontractor? 

A28:  A large business firm may not be part of a small business IDIQ contract team if that large business functions in providing the three indicated key services: Project Development, Commissioning, and Construction Management.  A large business may be a small business consultant if providing specialty services, e.g. blast resistance, geotechnical engineering, diagnostics testing, etc.

Q29:  If a Joint Venture team is formed, should the team submit one SF330 that combines qualifications for both firms?

A29:  Submit a single SF 330, indicating the contract relationships that exists between all parties.  An entity must be recognized as having a legal basis to represent all parties involved. 

 
Q30:  Does GSA have a preference in presenting IDIQ projects listed under Section F (for example, one IDIQ contract description containing multiple task orders, a single project from an IDIQ contract, or some combination thereof)?

A30:  Your choice.

Q31:  For the SF330 Part I, will there be a page limitation, particularly for Section H?

A31:  Complete the SF 330 completely, but avoid padding it with other document materials/excerpts, or text that only adds bulk.

Q32:  Will firms selected to enter into contract negotiations for all eight IDIQ contracts be notified at the same time?

A32:  Yes, i.e. within a day or two of each other.

Q33:  If a small business falls within NAICS 233320 ($27.5M), but not within NAICS 541618, can the small business still submit as the prime contractor?

A33:  Only under “Full and Open Competition.”  The requirement is for Commissioning and Expert Professional Services.  NAICS code 541618 is the prime NAICS code; therefore, contractors who wish to submit proposals for the “Small Business Set-aside” contracts must average $6M for annual gross receipts.

Q34:  For a Joint Venture of SBE firms that submit for the SBE “Set-Aside” contract(s), does the $6MM revenue limit [defining an SBE firm] apply to the COLLECTIVE revenue of ALL of the member firms of the Joint Venture, or simply to EACH of the SBE firm JV members?

 
A34:  The $6M applies to ALL of the SBs average annual gross receipts combined.  If your Joint Venture exceeds $6M, you will not qualify for an award under the small business set-aside contracts.  You must submit your proposal under “Full and Open Competition”.


Q35:  Can you tell me if there will be a published list with contacts of interested parties for the Commissioning and Planning Solicitation (GS-00P-05-CY-0156)?  If not, is the list of respondents available from the sources sought notice (GS-00P-05-CY-0091A)?

A35:  No.  The interested parties lists are not available to the public.

<DESC>Thee are the answers to questions that have been received thus far in reference to solicaiton number HSCG23-05-R-DOT097.

The deadline for any questions is 2pm EST on 4 August 2005.

Questions Received for Solicitation HSCG23-05-R-DOT097

1. The bid appears to require only supplying technical advisors and instructors, with the Government supplying all equipment, facilities etc.  The solicitation indicates Time and Materials, yet details indicate all materials will be supplied by the Government.  Can you tell me: a) if the bid is only for personnel services, b) does it include us providing any written/audio or visual class materials, c) do we provide our own curriculum?

Answer:  This contract is for tactical training services, and involves both services and materials, hence the FFP and Time and Materials CLINs.  The government will supply the equipment listed in Section 3 of the Statement of Work.  All other supplies and equipment used by Contractor personnel and USCG students must be provided by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall utilize exisiting curriculum, as well as augment and develop additional training throughout the life of the contract.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing all class materials that may be needed, to include, but not limited to, written; audio; and visual materials.

2.  The original solicitation of July 18 indicated five specific types of “qualifications and experience” that Contractor personnel must possess: 
a.  Para 1.3.2.1 “…conducting firearms training…” 
b.  Para 1.3.2.1 “…provide combat  provide combat medical
training”
c.  Para 1.3.2.2 “…operate USCG boats” 
d.  Para 1.3.2.4 “…provide Chemical, Biological, Radiological
(CBR) training.” 
e.  Para 1.3.2.5 “…flying military aircraft (i.e. helicopters) in
a military special operations missions profile are required to advise CG
aviation personnel.”   

Question:  It is our understanding that the personnel with the qualifications and experience shown above will teach the courses/training listed in the CLINs.  Is this a correct assumption?  If not, where will these individuals be utilized?

Answer: That is correct.  The  instructors must have the requisite experience and qualifications listed in the Statement of Work and shall provide the training services listed in the CLINs. 

3.  Para 5.1.1 says that contractor shall be “responsible for planning and conducting advanced tactical training;” does this mean that the Contractor must develop course curriculum/POI?  If so, what are the appropriate references to develop these courses?  Are these references available to prospective bidders/contractors and if so, how does a prospective bidder/contractor acquire them?

Answer:  See answer to question number one above.  Additionally, the Contractor shall ensure that the tactical procedures taught are in accordance with current USCG policies regarding use of force.

4.  The requirement that “the contractor shall submit lesson plans” implies that POIs may already be in place.  Is this correct?  If so, are any of these courses currently being taught?  If so, which ones?  Are the POIs to these courses (being currently taught) available to prospective bidders/contractors and if so, how does a prospective bidder/contractor acquire them?

Answer: POIs will be required to be submitted by the contractor. Required core tasks can be provided upon request.

5.  If the courses/training listed in the CLINs are currently being taught, how can a contractor get the existing lesson plans, curriculum and/or POI?  If the courses are not being taught, how can a contractor get applicable references?  

Answer: POIs will be required to be submitted by the contractor. 

6.  Do the Mobile Training Teams described in CLIN 00004, teach the courses in CLINs 00001 thru 00003?  If not, what do the MTTs teach to the “on-site” units? 

Answer:   They are primarily to provided sustainment and currency training to personnel who have completed CLINs 0001 and 0002.

7.  Will there be a pre-bid site visit and /or conference?  If one is not scheduled, we would like to request one.

Answer:  There is no pre-bid site visit planned for this procurement.

8. Is the mention of 30 pages in the Synopsis/Solicitation to be taken as the all-inclusive limit for a proposal?  Or is the pricing part of the proposal to be separate?

Answer:  The 30 page limit is all-inclusive for the technical portion of the proposal.

9.  Are there any other instructions for the offerors?

Answer:  Any additional information or instructions for offerors will be posted as a numbered Amendment to the solicitation on the Federal Business Opportunity website (www.eps.gov) under the original solicitation number.

10.  Who is the incumbent, and who individually would serve as an official of that firm that we might contact to discuss subcontracting possibilities?

Answer:  The incumbent contractor is CACI Premier Technologies, Incorporated.

11.  You have instructed that CLINs 00001, 00002, 10001, and 10002 be costed as firm fixed prices (FFP).  Each one stipulates a minimum and a maximum number of courses.  Should we then present what the FFP would be for the minimum – one course – and what it would be for the maximum – seven courses?  If not, what are your expectations here? 

Answer:  Offerors are expected to provided a per course price for each of these CLINs and a total price for the maximum number of courses that may be needed for each of these CLINs.

12.  The same question applies to the T&M CLINs.  We understand the applicable ceiling, but what are the default numbers we should use for frequency of as-needed training and time length of each iteration, and in CLINs 00005 and 10005, continuous technical services?

Answer:  Offerors should provide the labor types/categories proposed, the price per hour for each category, and the total number of hours for each category proposed for each T&M CLIN. 

13.   Will CLINs 00005 and 10005 be performed in Coast Guard spaces?  If so, will that be at CG Headquarters?  Or do you intend that it be performed in nearby contractor-owned space?

Answer: This work will be performed in contractor-owned spaces with consultations being made with USCG personnel.

14.  Will small boats and helicopters mentioned in the Statement of Work be supplied by the Coast Guard, or is the contractor responsible for providing them?

Answer:  Per Section 3 of the Statement of Work, the USCG will provide helicopters/fuel and boats/fuel for use in training activities and operational exercises.
 
15.  Will the Coast Guard provide life support and safety equipment, rope and cables, weapons adapted to MILES/ESS equipment and/or Dye Marking Cartridges, or will the contractor be responsible for providing them?

Answer:  Yes, the USCG will provide the listed items.

16.  If the Government is going to reimburse travel, does that mean we don't have to bid out travel expenses in our original proposal?  Does this include air, lodging, rental vehicles and per diem for food?

Answer:  As all travel under this contract will be approved in advance and reimbursed by the Government, offerors need to identify an estimated ceiling for travel in their proposal.
 
17.  What is the maximum number of personnel we will be training at any given time? In other words, are the 200 personnel for the EMSST all located at the same facility?  Likewise, what is the smallest number?  Will the Coast Guard be flying all personnel in to Chesapeake / Camp Lejuene etc., and then we'll be training each individual unit at their duty station?

Answer:  Maximum projected personnel at on time is 96. The smallest projected number is 15. The USCG will be sending its personnel for initial training to Camp Lejeune, NC.
 
18.  Do all personnel requiring a Top Secret clearance need to have that prior to the contract award date, or will it be issued by DOD on a need to know basis after the award?

Answer:  Contractor personnel will be required to have Top Secret clearance upon award of the contractor to gain immediate access to the classified material upon award.
 
19.  Is there a current incumbent firm conducting this training or similar training to the Coast Guard?
 
Answer:  See answer to question number ten above.

20.  Is only one helicopter pilot required and is his role to train USCG pilots on special operations protocol, or will he be flying aircraft himself to support training evolutions on ship boarding, etc.?

Answer:  The Contractor shall provide one qualified helicopter pilot and his/her role shall be to provide both training in tactical operations to USCG pilots, and to pilot USCG helicopters during training evolutions involving tactical operations training activities.

21.  Should the solicitation be amended to provide for a more applicable (and best value based) type of contract termed Fixed Unit Price / Level Of Effort?

Answer:  The contract resulting from this solicitation will contain Firm Fixed-Price contract line items and Time and Materials contract line items.

22. Although the solicitation does not specify it completely, I assume that the majority of training will be for VBSS?

Answer: The training is for Advanced Interdiction and Counter-Terrorism Operations.

23.  What particular areas of training will this course encompass? (i.e. weapons, marksmanship, boat operations, VBSS, etc.)

Answer: Training for the courses will encompass, but not be limited to, weapons, marksmanship, boat operation, Close Quarters Combat, breaching, vertical insertion of personnel, and Couter Intelligence tactics.

26.  How many courses per year? (I know that the solicitation is for a minimum of one and up to seven)

Answer:  There will be up to 7 course convenings each year.

27.  What types of facilities are available to conduct the training? Our company is very familiar with Camp Lejeune and the training facility in Chesapeake. Will the contractor be using the sites located on these installations?

Answer: Facilities located at Camp Lejeune, NC and Chesapeake, VA will be available for the courses through the coordination of the USCG Special Missions Training Center, Camp Lejeune, NC.


28.  Does the Coast Guard require our training COI’s and LOI’s and all training and reference materials?

Answer: Yes.

29.  The facilities at Lejuene, Chesapeake, et al:  Are they dedicated to this training or shared with other training requirements on LeJeune or Chesapeake, et. al. and how does the contractor request/schedule them?

Answer: Facilities are shared, but will be coordinated with the USCG Special Missions Training Center, Camp Lejeune , NC

30.  According to the SOW, USCG provides offices, phones, and workstations.  What about office supplies or support (copiers, printers, faxes, etc)?

Answer: Copiers, printers, and faxes will be provided.
 
31.  Training materials:  according to the SOW, USCG provides equipment.  What about expendables such as weapons cleaning equipment, range materials such as targets, etc.?

Answer: Weapons, cleaning equipment, targets, and other range materials will be provided by the USCG.
 
32.  Training:  Does the USCG have an outline of the training program (such as list of classes with tasks conditions and standards)?

Answer: See answer to question number five above.
 
33.  Instructors:  Aside from Key Personnel, does the USCG require a certain student/instructor ratio?

Answer: No, however, the USCG requests to know the planned ratio in its proposal.

34.  Will the USCG, in a succeeding amendment, release a projected training schedule at each potential site, with courses, duration of each, and dates to allow a potential contractor to draft a Project Plan prior to the kick-off?

Answer:  A projected training schedule will be provided to the contractor following award of the  contract.

35.  Is there an incumbent currently carrying out this or similar training at the facilities listed under contract for the Coast Guard?

Answer:  See answer to question number ten above.

<DESC>Amendment-04 for Solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV is being issued to answer questions received from an interested vendor.     The due date for proposal remains unchanged to August 8, 2005 at 1:00PM EDT.

Question 1:

What is the turnaround time for analyzing 1000 urine samples?

Answer 1:

A 9 months turnaround time is anticipated.

Question 2:
 
What is the CAS number for the subject compound?  Is the name spell right?
 
Answer 2:  

CAS numbers are:
1-OHP –5315-79-7
MDA – 542-78-9
8-OHdG – 5614-64-2
2-naphthol – 135-19-3

Yes, they are spelled correctly.



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure the analysis of 1000 urine samples for two PAH metabolites (1-OHP, 2-naphthol) and two oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, MDA). The services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance FAR 12  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541380, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

BACKGROUND:  PAHs have shown to cause mammary cancer in experimental animals. Some epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between breast cancer and occupational exposure to PAHs, active and passive smoking, and consumption of well-done meats which contains high levels of PAHs.  Although these are potentially important exposures for breast cancer, the evidence is not clear.  Exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies is based on information from interviews.  Measurements of urinary PAH metabolites in subjects with PAHs exposure in an epidemiological study would reduce misclassification of exposure and provide information on total PAH exposure.  Simultaneous measurements of 1-OHP and 2-naphthol would, therefore, provide better understanding of the total, as well as route-specific, PAH exposure and help clarify the relation of these chemicals with the risk of breast cancer.  There is growing interest in the role of oxidative stress from chemicals like these and breast cancer development because of cross-talk between oxidative stress and hormonal imbalance.  There are, however, a limited number of population-based studies of oxidative stress and breast cancer.  Among several biomarkers of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondiadelyde (MDA) are most frequently used because of their biological importance and the sensitivity of the assay.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall perform the following tasks on 1000 urine samples sent all at one time:  1) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 1-OHP;  2) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 2-naphthol;  3) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 8-OHdG; 4) Analyze 1000 urine samples for MDA; and 5) Provide results of the analyses in an Excel spreadsheet to the Project Officer containing sample ID, test-date, test results and if applicable, quality control data. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITES:  NCI will ship the 1000 urine samples on dry ice. Samples will be coded and will not have any personal identifiers attached.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Offers will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria.  The technical portion 	of the proposal will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  1)  Technical Approach – 50% proposed methods for measurements of urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biomarkers of oxidative stress must be sound and fully described.

PLEASE DELETE THIS SENTENCE "Additionally, this mission will also follow up with the Nigerian Ports Authority on the status of projects recommended in a Definitional Mission for port sector projects in Nigeria completed in 2003" and REPLACE WITH THIS PARAGRAPH "Additionally, this Definitional Mission Contractor shall meet with the Nigerian Ports Authority personnel to discuss and make a determination on whether four port development projects that were of interest to the Nigerian Ports Authority in 2003 have the potential of moving forward, and whether they would be good candidates for USTDA-supported feasibility studies.  These projects include a Nigerian Ports Authority computerization project, a port modernization project for the Lagos Ports Complex and Port Harcourt, the expansion of the Onne Port Complex, and the development of a deep-sea port away from presently congested port docking areas.  There is no further information available to offerors regarding these projects at this time."
