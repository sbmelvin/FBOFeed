Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the 554 ELSG/SBG in developing an acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensiti! ve information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  
Responses are to be submitted via email to tailee.tucker@gunter.af.mil by 4:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on 23 Jan 2009. This is an information gathering effort only and if further procurement action is taken, additional publication(s) will be done as required. Please limit your response to a maximum of fifteen (15) one-sided pages.  Ensure each of the capabilities is addressed separately and in the order listed in paragraph 3 below.  1.	Background
The Headquarters Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) is responsible for medical war readiness of all personnel, equipment, and materiel to train, equip, and maintain for wartime support.  This responsibility extends to major commands (MAJCOMs) and other support organizations within and outside the continental United States.  This role spans from peacetime readiness maintenance to real-world deployments of medical personnel and equipment.  Medical readiness personnel collect, process, and distribute medical data; command authorities use medical readiness information to support medical deployments.  A requirement exists to establish a multi-command, remotely-available medical readiness decision support system using collaborative office features for medical personnel and war readiness materiel (WRM) assemblage management.
The mission of Headquarters 554 Electronic Systems Group Medical Information Systems Branch (HQ 554 ELSG/SBG) is to direct and coordinate the acquisition, development, and sustainment of information management systems in support of medical business practices.  Activities include needs analysis; requirements definition; coordination of design, code and unit testing; functional testing; implementation; and follow-on customer support.  The SBG office develops and assures compliance with policies, directives, plans, and procedures for the control of all system procurement, development, and maintenance activities.  2.	System Overview
The system developed to satisfy this requirement, the Air Force MRDSS, incorporates all aspects of decision support required for management and deployment of people and equipment from MAJCOM and United States Air Force (USAF) medical views.  MRDSS enables the USAF medical community to quickly and effectively monitor a unit's personnel/training and equipment readiness status in peacetime and wartime environments.  Medical readiness and logistics planners more efficiently and effectively assess unit readiness and manage their assigned resources from a unit type code (UTC) perspective.  MAJCOM planners determine deployment and employment requirements from operations plans (OPLANs) or operations orders, and then determine the readiness of the appropriate UTC for assigned or gained units.  Planners use the detailed unit readiness data to make more accurate readiness decisions.  The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) uses the Medical Resource Letter (MRL) function to manage current ! and future AFMS UTC requirements.  From these UTC requirements, manpower resources and materiel costs can be projected for current and fiscal out-years.  Unit-level users monitor and update personnel UTC-specific, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)-specific, and Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP) training; assign individuals to UTCs; track deployed personnel and materiel; maintain Disaster Team assignments; and maintain unit Recall Rosters.  Users at all levels can immediately assess materiel shortfalls (both War Reserve stocks and Homeland Defense (HLD)) down to the line-item detail and determine costs associated with improving readiness.  AFMS AFSC Consultants use MRDSS to track and assess availability of Low Density-High Demand medical specialists to fill critical deployment positions.
MRDSS provides visibility of information being reported by the units.  Unit medical readiness and medical logistics personnel can use MRDSS to display the percentages of readiness capability for assigned UTCs; view materiel information; and update readiness personnel, training, and deployment information on the MRDSS Web server.  MAJCOMs can edit their units' input to ensure accuracy and completeness.
MRDSS is essential to proper USAF medical readiness operations and assists units, MAJCOMS and HQ USAF in managing and deploying medical personnel and materiel.  In accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, MRDSS is a Mission Assurance Category (MAC) II, Sensitive system.MRDSS supports all Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard  Medical units worldwide.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management intends to make a sole source award to Information Handeling Services located at 15 Inverness Way EAst Englewood, CO, 81112.Through its Fluid Minerals program, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for managing the development of oil and gas and helium reservoirs by industry operators on Federal and Indian lands.  Currently, these reservoirs are being developed and produced in several hundred thousand oil and gas wells with over 25,000 Federal and 6,000 oil and gas leases.  BLM staff engineers, geologists, and technicians in over 30 Field Offices have been using well completion reports to determine if any wells drilled in the U.S., not just wells drilled on Federal and Indian lands, contain oil and gas and helium resources that belong to the public or Indians.  Since the late l950s the contracted Dwights and PI well service companies to provide such information on well completions as well as production data on individual wells or wells committed to unitization or communitization agreements.  About 15 years ago, IHS Energy Group bought Dwights/PI and BLM has established yearly contracts with IHS to provide such data on CD ROMS, with monthly updates. IHS is the only service company that provides such data.  IHS system provides input of data on well completions and production history into their system almost instantaneously.Continuing our contact with IHS without interruption is so critical to the operation and management of BLMs fluid minerals program.  Specifically, their Historical and Production Data CDs are much needed to: 1. Determine whether and to what extent oil and gas resources are valuable in developing land use plans, 2. Determine if any Federal or Indian oil and gas leases are subject to drainage by well producing on nearby lands. 3. Ensure that public and Indian mineral interest owners receive their proper share of  oil and gas resources in unitiziation, communitization, and other agreements 4. Conduct fair market fair assessment of Indian oil and gas lease sale parcel. 5. Determine if Indian oil and gas leases are being diligently developed.6. And to do paying well determinations for oil and gas drainage cases, Indian diligence, and agreements using available automated software.7. To do sample estimates the amount of helium resources that are contained in oil and gas wells on a nationwide basis. Continuing to purchase HIS well data CDs through their Total U.S. coverage arrangement is the most cost effective means of ensuring that oil and gas well data is provided to BLM Field Offices in a timely, accurate, and efficient.

<DESC>Healthcare Quality Information Systems (HCQIS) Infrastructure Support

Pre-Solicitation Notice
Dated 12/23/2008

Purpose

The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to obtain infrastructure services to support  SDPS, VBP, CROWNWeb, and QIES application groups; Help Desk, QIO System Administration, and production support control for the SDPS group; production support control for the VBP application group; and file/print and desktop services for both ESRD and QIO facilities.

All efforts shall be performed in accordance with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements and shall meet the objectives of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and timely implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements. This is a Set Aside for 8(a) business. The estimated level of effort for the contract is approximately 300,000 hours per year (Base + 4). CMS anticipates awarding this contract in July 2009; the Period of Performance will be Base + 4 12-month option years.

Introduction

The HealthCare Quality Information System (HCQIS) is a major application environment that uses application groups, shared servers, and WAN to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  HCQIS is composed of 5 application groups:

1.	Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), including the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC);

2.	Value Based Purchasing (VBP) IT Infrastructure for Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) and Hospital Outpatient;

3.	Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb);

4.	Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) for states and CMS;

5.	Quality Improvement Initiatives (QII)

This statement of work is phase 2, of a 4-phase process. The other phases will be issue as separate solicitations with their specific SOW, requirements, evaluation criteria, etc. The Government estimates that it will issue these separate solicitations during 2008-2010. This information is being provided as informational only and it does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The four Phases that currently being developed are:

Phase 1  Program Management and Business Requirement Contract

Phase 2  Infrastructure Contract (Current Solicitation)

Phase 3  Reports and Analytics Contract

Phase 4  Development Contract

CMS will utilize several contracts to develop and support the SDPS and VBP application groups. The follow restrictions will apply:

	The Prime and Sub-contractor(s) awarded Phase (I) Business Requirements and Program Management, both will be excluded from eligibility on Phase (IV) Development.
	The Prime contractor awarded Phase (I) Business Requirements and Program Management, will be excluded from eligibility on Phase (II) Infrastructure.
	The Prime contractor awarded Phase (II) Infrastructure, will be excluded from eligibility on Phase (I) Business Requirements and Program Management and Phase (IV) Development.
	Any Sub-contractor(s) of Phase (I) Business Requirements and Program will be excluded from eligibility of Phase (IV) Development.
	Any Sub-contractor(s) awarded Phase (I) Business Requirements and Program Management, may be eligibility to bid on Phase (II) Infrastructure.

Background

The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS), implemented in 1997, supports the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) program and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) community.  Prior to SDPS, each QIO was responsible for developing solutions to meet the management and reporting requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW).  Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each QIO had different competencies during that period.  Since the inception of SDPS, the functions of SDPS have encompassed support, standardization and development of data, software and standards for the QIO community.  SDPS continues to rapidly evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the QIO community and surrounding healthcare industry.

Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) are under contract by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to

	Improve quality of care for beneficiaries;

	Protect the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare pays only for services and goods that are reasonable and medically necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting; and

	Protect beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing individual complaints, notices, and appeals, such as beneficiary complaints; provider-issued notices of non-coverage (Hospital-Issued Notice of Non-Coverage [HINN], Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights [NODMAR], and Medicare Advantage appeal); Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) violations; and other related statutory QIO responsibilities.

The statutory authority for the QIO Statement of Work is found in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982.  The Act established the Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization Program, now known as the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program.

The statutory mission of the Program, as set forth in Section 1862(g) of the Act, is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.

In support of the QIO program, CMS authorized the design and implementation of a SDPS for the User Community.  SDPS is an information system solution that provides a common platform for users to share applications and data to promote efficiency and increase productivity.  SDPS is the QIO Information Technology and data support infrastructure.

The SDPS User Community, for purposes of this contract, refers to the QIOs, the State Agencies, CMS Central and Regional Offices, the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC), and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives.  This system services the daily, ongoing support that the SDPS User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement program.

The VBP application group utilizes SDPS applications and warehouses in addition to other VBP specific products.  These applications and warehouse support two provisions of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) Division B, Title 1:

1.	Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement, includes the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). This law authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a voluntary quality reporting program.  Eligible professionals, who chose to participate and successfully report on a designated set of quality measures for services paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and provided between July 1 and December 31, 2007 to Medicare beneficiaries under the traditional fee-for-service program, may earn a bonus payment of 1.5% of their charges during that period, subject to a cap.

On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) for 2008.  The 2008 PQRI reporting period is January 1-December 31, 2008. 

The Extension Act also provides new authorities for enhancing PQRI that CMS will be implementing during 2008.  MMSEA requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting groups of measures via claims for 2008.  It also requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting measures via registries to enable professionals to earn the 1.5% incentive for participation in PQRI based on data submitted via these mechanisms. 

2.	Section 109, requires the development of measures for the evaluation of the quality of care of services provided by hospitals in outpatient settings. An Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program modeled after the current Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) RHQDAPU program will be established.
Section 109, which applies to hospitals as defined under section 1886(d)(1(B) of the Act, also requires that hospital outpatient departments (HOPD) that fail to report data required for the quality measures selected by the Secretary will incur a reduction in their annual OPD fee schedule increase factor by 2.0 percentage points. OPPS payments beginning in CY 2009 will be based on hospital reporting of OPD data beginning in CY 2008. 

Maintenance of information on the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) population by CMS is mandated by legislation and regulation. (See Public Law 95-292, Section (c)(1)(A); 42 CFR, Chapter IV, Part 476; and Public Law 92-603, Section 299I).  In support of the CMS ESRD community, CMS created the Program Management and Medical Information System (PMMIS).  The PMMIS is the system of records for the CMS ESRD data, and is maintained by way of the CROWN suite of systems.  CROWN refers to any and all components of the DESCM suite of ESRD systems  the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), the Standard Information Management System (SIMS), CROWNWeb, Cognos Reporting Tool, QualityNet Identity Provisioning System (QIPS), and all related databases and architecture. 

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) authorized the design and implementation of the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWN) for support of the ESRD User Community. CMS is continuing to expand on its initiative to integrate the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) systems under CROWN.  CMS and the ESRD Networks have been working together to build CROWN to provide for the collection and validation of information about the Medicare ESRD program, its beneficiaries, and the services provided to them.  It is vitally important that CMS continues progress made in support of new ESRD Conditions for Coverage and towards the support of the CROWNWeb system that will support the ESRD Conditions for Coverage.  The Contractor will cooperate closely with the appropriate SDPS application and QualityNet infrastructure support contractors in supporting all CROWN applications.  During the course of this contract, the Contractor must depend on useable business requirements and data dictionary products for their production of accurate functional specifications, design, and ultimately a properly coded application. 

The Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) is CMSs key tracking, analysis, and data repository system for Medicare, Medicaid, and CLIA provider quality of care.  QIES collects and validates data on provider and beneficiary specific outcomes of care and performance across a multitude of delivery sites (including nursing homes, home health agencies, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and swing bed hospitals) for use in improving the quality and cost effectiveness of services provided by the Medicare/Medicaid/CLIA programs.  QIES is considered to be a Medicare Modernization Act (of 1999) (MMA) critical CMS system integral to many key CMSs quality of care activities including: the Survey and Certification program; the Administrators quality indicators for Nursing Homes (NH) and Home Health Agencies (HHA); complaints and enforcement monitoring; accreditation processes; consumer information initiatives (such as Nursing Home and Home Health Compare); as well as, data validation and survey process enhancement initiatives.  

QIES is also crucial to CMS payment systems for Skilled Nursing Facilities and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities. The system collects and validates patient assessment data directly linked to claims for payment and correlates utilization groupings to actual patient clinical and functional status. 

QIES directly supports and implements provisions of OBRA 1987, HIPAA 1996, BBA 1997, and the MMA, and numerous implementing regulations.  QIES also fulfills CMS action items pursuant to GAO and OIG reports and Congressional committee corrective action plans on the Nursing Home enforcement and complaints processes. 

QIES has been under development since 1998 and is now at a critical system development life cycle (SDLC) juncture in a multi-year effort to convert of our most complex providers (CLIA laboratories and hospitals) from the legacy Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting System (OSCAR) to QIES.  Adding to the urgency and complexity of current work are implementation of the legislative mandates of Section 723 of the MMA and National Provider Identifier for HIPAA; and two regulations pursuant to BBA97 making significant changes to the PPS assessment specifications for both NHs and HHAs.  The continued, uninterrupted conversion of QIES is critical to CMSs payment and quality of care improvement processes, and to implementation and support of statutory mandates and major CMS and DHHS initiatives.

The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain contractor support for the technical infrastructure components of the QualityNet environment.  This infrastructure support is wide-ranging, covering areas such as:

	Hosting a data center
	Network management
	UNIX and Microsoft servers management
	Configuration management
	IV&V Testing
	Stress Testing
	Project management
	Security
	Help Desk
	Procurement
	Production Support
	QIO System Administration
	SAN Administration
	VTC Administration
	DBA Support

1. The contractor shall proactively manage the evolutionary growth and expansion of the QualityNet technical infrastructure.

2. The contractor shall also manage the evolution of engineering and development processes, including configuration management and testing.  

3. The contractor shall organize and take an active role in Joint Application Development (JAD) meetings, workgroups, user groups and any other activity that would allow for improvement in the support, operation and enhancement of the HCQIS. 

4. The contractor shall provide the infrastructure support for the annual Quality Net Conference held in Baltimore, MD.  

5. The contractor shall provide a network operations center (NOC) capable of providing the required service in a robust manner for the production QualityNet environment.

6. The Contractor shall include all network and system administration activities and proactive support for the QualityNet Help Desk.  

7. The Contractor shall participate in business requirements and product design during this stage of the SDLC.

The following qualifications are necessary on this project:

	Strong project management skills to manage changes that will come from different CMS and contractor organizations.

	Diverse engineering and systems administration skills in the areas of local and wide area networks, Windows Database Servers, and Office 2007 operating systems, advanced storage systems, high availability and backup and recovery methodologies, and video teleconferencing.

	Diverse engineering and systems administration skills in wide area network and local area networking technologies (preferred CISCO background).

	A verifiable and successful track record on this type of work, preferably at CMS.  

	Strong application stress and usability testing knowledge and background.

	Help Desk/Call Center Support experience in a large environment.

The minimum contractor requirements are written proof of a CMMI Level II Certification (SCAMPI Report), at time of contract award.

<DESC>This announcement is part of a series of Request for Information (RFI)/Market Surveys for the FAA Data Communications Program.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO).  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
Background
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released four prior Requests for Information (RFI). The first was seeking information on the air-ground network and related infrastructure (#5470; the second was related to the ground system, en route automation, and related processing functions (#6034); the third provided perspectives regarding options for a potential service that integrates the components of the air-ground system into an overall Data Communication service (#6513); and the most recent was to summarize the FAA's understanding of the environment in which Data Communications will operate and provide some information on decisions that have been made (#7279).
Current Status
The Data Communications Program continues to develop its program and acquisition strategy while considering the input of industry. In that light this communication is the second of three discussed in the last RFC (#7279) that are planned for the next several months. This release includes a paper outlining preliminary program and acquisition strategy considerations intended for industry comment. The final communication for industry comment (in March/April 2009) will include more detail on the air-ground subnetwork acquisition, potentially including a draft subnet specification or equivalent Subnet Description Document.  These documents may contain material that will supersede the Initial Program Requirements Document (iPR) dated 28 April 2008 attached in the 7279 announcement.   Overview 
The Data Communications Program is planning a multiple contract approach to fulfill the program requirements. A single contractor will provide the air/ground VHF data link service with system engineering and integration support to the program office.  Separate contracts will be used for satisfying domain automation requirements. This RFC addresses only the Data Communication Network Service (DCNS) contract to provide the air/ground VHF data link service between the FAA automation systems and the NAS users.  This service will have a significant impact on both the FAA and NAS users, including operational, infrastructure, standards, equipage, and financial impacts.  The Data Communications Program intends to establish a partnership with the DCNS contractor in which the DCNS contractor would assist the FAA program office in meeting the overall Data Communications Program goals in addition to providing the FAA with a high quality air/ground VHF data service. 
This document is provided for comment. It addresses many of the questions received from our last RFC and outlines the FAA's strategies in several key areas, including important considerations related to the scope and structure of the proposed DCNS acquisition. Industry comments are welcome, as are any other thoughts on structure or strategy considerations discussed. Please provide any input in writing to the Contracting Officer, Sue Handy, by January 16, 2009, email address Sue.Handy@faa.gov.   
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: NOTICE OF INTENTIncorporation of the Transportation and Mechanical Services Scope of WorkInto the Savannah River SiteManagement and Operation ContractU. S. Department of EnergySavannah River Operations OfficeOffice of Acquisition ManagementP.O. Box A, Aiken SC, 29802-0900The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR)Office of Acquisition Management intends to non-competitively incorporateTransportation and Mechanical Services work into its recently awardedManagement and Operating (M&O) contract with Savannah River NuclearSolutions,LLC (SRNS).  In 2006, the Transportation and Mechanical Services supportfunction, historically performed by the M&O contractor, was excluded fromtheDepartments M&O contract solicitation in support of a DOE Complex-wideeffortto increase the number of prime contracts awarded to small businesses.DOEsintent was to award this scope of work to a small business.  The actionrepresents a continuing service requirement for the entire aggregateperformance term of the M&O contract with SRNS, which has a base period offive(5) years and includes an option to extend the contract for up to five (5)additional years.Description of the service:Transportation and Mechanical Services, which includes emergency specialtyequipment services, transportation services on site and off site(non-nuclear),fuel management (all types), fire protection engineering, and fire test andmaintenance (outside the nuclear fence).The statutory sole-source authority to non-competitively incorporate theTransportation and Mechanical Services scope of work listed above is 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1); only one responsible source and no other supplies or serviceswillsatisfy the Agencys requirements.The Transportation and Mechanical Services scope of work is presently beingperformed by the former SRS M&O contractor, Washington Savannah RiverCompany,LLC, (WSRC), under a contract extension to provide liquid waste cleanupoperations until the award of the new SRS Liquid Waste contract.  The WSRCcontract expires in March 2009.WSRC, SRNS and three other contractors who perform work at SRS are sponsorsofa Multiple Employer Pension Plan (SRS MEPP), which is a tax-qualifieddefined-benefit pension plan. The SRS MEPP has approximately 8,000 activeparticipants.  The active participants in the SRS MEPP include all of thecurrent WSRC employees and SRNS employees who are considered to beincumbentemployees under the terms of the SRNS M&O contract.DOE practice is for incumbent employees of DOE contractors who participateincontractor-sponsored defined benefit pension plans at a given DOE site tobeable to continue to participate in those plans if they are hired by asuccessorDOE contractor at that site, subject to applicable contract and benefitplanterms and conditions and legal requirements.  In this regard, new DOEcontractors at a given site are required to sponsor an entire existingdefinedbenefit pension plan or a new segment of an existing defined benefitpensionplan.  This is so that incumbent employees hired by the new employer areableto continue to participate in their existing defined benefit pension plansinaccordance with the terms of those plans.  Any new Transportation andMechanical Services contractor would have to become a sponsor of the SRSMEPPso that WSRC employees hired by the Transportation and Mechanical Servicescontractor could continue to participate in the SRS MEPP.To become a sponsor of a MEPP, any individual employer must meet rigorousInternal Revenue Service (IRS) testing requirements on an individualemployerbasis.  This is because if only one employer/contractor sponsoring asegment ofthe MEPP cannot meet the IRS testing requirements, the entire MEPP will bedisqualified.  If a MEPP is disqualified, all of the employer sponsors maylosethe tax-deductibility of their contributions and, in addition, certain planearnings may become taxable income for all of the plan participants.The IRS rules regarding minimum participation for a segment of a MEPP aresetforth at 26 U.S.C.  401(a)(26).  These rules require that a segment of aMEPPmust benefit at least the lesser of 50 employees of the employer, or thegreater of 40 percent of all employees of the employer, or two employees(or ifthere is only one employee, such employee).  Less than 50 WSRC employeescurrently perform the work encompassed by the Transportation and MechanicalServices work scope.   Based on these facts, DOE is not aware of anyresponsible source, other than the M&O contractor, that could satisfy theIRSminimum participation requirements for a stand-alone Transportation andMechanical Services segment of the SRS MEPP.  DOE, therefore, intends toexecute a bilateral modification with SRNS that incorporates theTransportationand Mechanical Services scope of work into the M&O contract.There are no solicitation documents available for these requirements.Interested responsible sources may submit information regarding theircapability to perform the Transportation and Mechanical Services scope ofworkand its capability to sponsor a new qualified segment of the SRS MEPP.Suchinformation shall be considered by the Department for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition.  Anyresponding party must provide a capability statement to demonstrate thefollowing information:  (1) that the responding party can sponsor atax-qualified segment of the SRS MEPP that includes the WSRC employees whopresently perform the Transportation and Mechanical Services work scope.Thisinformation must include a detailed analysis with necessary supporting datathat demonstrates the responding party will be able to sponsor atax-qualifiedsegment of the SRS MEPP that adheres to all relevant IRS regulations for aMEPP, including but not limited to minimum participation requirements setforthat 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(26); and (2) that the responding party has the abilitytosuccessfully perform the Transportation and Mechanical Services functiondescribed above.Responses to this synopsis must be received via the Departments IndustryInteractive Procurement System by January 7, 2009.Contracting Office Address:P.O.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a KA/KU BAND RADAR TRANSCEIVER.The objective of this work is the performance of an engineering study for upgrading aKa/Ku-band radar transceiver (referred to as the Ka/Ku-band transceiver below). TheKa/Ku-band transceiver is intended for use as a component of the Ka/Ku-band radar that isbeing developed for the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Ground Validation System(GVS). The GPM GVS Ka/Ku-band radar will assist in mission product algorithm developmentin the pre-launch era, and will be used for validation of precipitation products in GPMspost-launch era. The Ka/Ku-band transceiver that is the object of this requirement  was designed anddeveloped by Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc. (RSS) of Barnstable, MA. under the SmallBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.  In it current configuration the RSStransceiver cannot meet the sensitivity requirements of the GPM GVS Ka/Ku-band radar. Theengineering study will identify the specific hardware (vendor and part numbers), cost,availability and quoted delivery times for the hardware, and the modifications to the RSStransceiver that will enable the final radar system, designed around Ka/Ku-bandtransceiver, to meet the GPM GVS requirements.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from REMOTE SENSING SOLUTIONS, INC. Pursuant toFAR 13.106 for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonablyavailable from only one source.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract to University of Alaska - Fairbanks, Palmer Research Station - Soils Laboratory, Palmer, AK.  Palmer Research Station will analyze frozen soil samples collected at Denali National Park & Preserve and Wrangell-St. Elias Park & Preserve.  The sole source justification is under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2).  This is a base year contract with 4 option years.  The value of the contract is expected to be approximately $75,000.
This contract is not a small business set aside.
NAICS: 541380
The National Park Service (NPS), Denali National Park requires the following tasks:
1.Receive and process frozen soil samples from vegetation monitoring personnel.  This includes the following:
a)Weighing of frozen samples to the nearest 0.1 gram.
b)Allowing frozen samples to air dry and weighing air-dried samples to determine percent moisture wet >> air dried again to the nearest 0.1 gram.
c)Sieving air dried samples to determine the gravel fraction (>2mm mesh size); determine percentage of sample gravel size to the nearest .1%.
d)Oven drying air dried soil samples, weighing oven dried samples to determine moisture percentage from air dried to oven dried (100 degrees C for 24 hours).
e)Report results for soil moisture percentages described above and gravel percentages in a spreadsheet format.
2.Perform laboratory analysis of soil samples to determine the following attributes, using the prescribed methodology and detection limits listed below:
a)Percent total soil nitrogen - minimum detection level 0.10 % nitrogen.  This should be determined using a LECO CHN 1000 Analyzer, a non-dispersive, infrared instrument.  These measurements will be made on a subsample of air-dried, finely- milled soil.
b)Percent total soil carbon - minimum detection level 0.10 % carbon. This should be determined using a  LECO CHN 1000 Analyzer, a non-dispersive, infrared instrument. These measurements will be made on a subsample of air-dried, finely- milled soil.
c)Soil reaction - pH by the 1:1 slurry method -- minimum detection level 0.01 pH units.  This is measured using 8.5 cm2 of air dried soils mixed with 10 ml distilled water and allowing a 30-minute standing time.  pH meter should be standardized using 4.00 and 7.00 pH buffers prior to running samples.
d)Soil texture - percent sand, silt and clay - min. detection level 0.1% for each size class (sand, silt, clay).  This should be determined using the Bouyoucos-Hydrometer method on 50 g of sieved, oven dried soil.  This is the standard method for reporting soil textural characteristics.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 332999   In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires fabrication of a heat exchanger from Government provided drawings and some provided materials for the National Vehicle and FuelEmissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  
This requirement entails the manufacture and the brazing in place of copper foam, both inside and outside, a bank of straight 316 stainless steel tubes.  The contractor will be provided with 116 stainless steel tubes that are 3/8" OD and 0.305" ID.  These tubes will be about 18.5" long.  Also included will be two 5/8" thick stainless steel manifolds with holes in them for the tubes.  These manifolds are supplied to allow for the proper location of the tubes when the exterior foam is placed.  All copper foam will be brazed in place using a brazing material that will withstand temperatures of at least 750C.  
The interior of the tubes will have open cell 40 ppi copper foam with a density of 6-9%.  The pressure drop through this bank of foam filled tubes should not exceed 1 bar with a steam flow of 0.02 liters/sec at 25 bar.  The tubes should be loaded in such a way that the outside 1 - 3/8" will be free of foam.
The exterior tubes will have open cell 10 PPI copper foam with a density of 6 - 8 %.  The dimensions of the extents of this foam will be provided in a drawing.  Just as the interior foam was centered on the midpoint of the tubes this foam will also be centered with 1.25" of the tubes protruding from each end.  The pressure drop of this assembly when flowing axially along but exterior to the tubes and keeping the other edges closed will not exceed not exceed 1.0 psi when 56 grams/sec of hot air at 300C flow through.  
This procurement is being conducted with full and open competitive procedures under NAICS code 332999 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria.  The solicitation will be released through the Ann Arbor office by e-mailing the Contract Specialist at niedermier.annette@epa.gov and requesting the solicitation number RFQ-MI-09-00052.  The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 10 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) located in Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ICLEI-Local Governments For Sustainability USA, Inc., of 436 14th Street, Suite 1520, Oakland, CA 94612 to provide technical support and services for the completion of the Climate and Air Pollution Planning Assistant (CAPPA) Tool. The project tasks entail (1) continuing the devlopment of the CAPPA tool through the compilation and evaluation of process and technical comments resulting from beta testing, (2) revision of the CAPPA Tool and (3) outreach and wide spread distribution.
 This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  EPA source research indicates that ICLEI-Local Goverments For Sustainability, USA Inc., is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project in a timely manner.  The original CAPPA Tool was developed and released for beta testing and expansive technical review by ICLEI-Local Governments For Sustainability, USA Inc. and because of their unique familiarity with the CAPPA Tool, they are the only known contractor capable of completing the requirements within the required time limitation. 
 However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish their potential of fulfilling such work.  Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 day of electronic posting of this notice (on or before Wednesday, January 7, 2009 at 5:00 PM EST.)  Interested parties should submit their technical documentation, referencing PR-NC-09-10060, preferably via email to Barbour.Beverly@epa.gov.  Documentation may also be submitted as follows: via regular mail addressed:  U.S. EPA, Attn:  Beverly Barbour MD105-02, Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. 
 The determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  EPA references 'FAR 6.302-1-- Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements', as the authority applicable to this circumstance for permitting other than full and open competition.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 813312, which has a $7 million dollar size standard.  
The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, therefore, no formal solicitation (RFQ) is available at this time.  Consequently, any response failing to provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting consideration and a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501 (a), on a sole source basis with Information Builders resellers for the purchase of  5 copies of  Web Focus Portal (Part Number IB-WPULV7.6-100 users and Maintenance,  and Part Number IB-WPULv7.6M-100 users).  SSA is in the process of expanding the features and capacity of its Web FOCUS environment, which due to limitations with other Windows based reporting tools, SSA anticipates a high demand for Web FOCUS Portal, which is a mainframe-based tool.  The anticipated user base includes numerous Agency components. Currently, SSA has multiple WebFOCUS software components installed on a mainframe computer, and requires additional licenses provide 500 enhancements to create executive dashboards and allow our analysts to analyze the data using the dashboards.  Agency requirements are also predicated upon the need to comply with NIST and OMB security mandates to protect critical level 3 rated internet applications utilized by SSA business partners, other government agencies, and potentially citizens.  
SSA conducted market research to locate alternative sources of supply for these products and the research resulted in Information Builders being the only vendors able to meet the Government needs.  WebFOCUS is proprietary software licensed by Information Builders, Inc.  As such, Information Builders, Inc has exclusive rights and does not authorize other entities to maintain its WebFOCUS software.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. This is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Information Builders resellers for the purchase of additional Web Focus software and maintenance services. At this time, the Government intends to issue a firm-fixed purchase order.  Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide the necessary products to meet this requirement may respond in writing no later than December 31, 2008, with capability statements and information describing in full detail their products to accomplish SSAs objective.  Capability statements must fully detail the respective firms specific technical specifications.  Interested parties that feel they can provide these products shall respond by submitting their capability statement by e-mail to Valerie.Jones@ssa.gov.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication.  Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with negotiations with Information Builders resellers.  Telephone calls will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Bulletin News Network is the only known source available that can provide tailored news summaries in a timely manner using copyrighted material contained in and provided by proprietary news-aggregation systems software and monitoring systems.  The use of this software and approach permits both customized and timely delivery to HHS of copyrighted news briefings.  The service integrates daily television and print coverage to produce a customized executive news briefing.  The contractor is the only known source that provides expert human editors to analyze thousands of stories every night from newspapers, magazines, trade press, and national and local television; summarize information that is important to the client; highlight reporting that is unique and valuable; eliminate that which is irrelevant or redundant; and deliver a single, concise briefing as early as 7:30 a.m.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The Government intends to acquire the service as a commercial item. HHS anticipates the award of a firm fixed-price contract, with a base year plus four one year options.

<SUBJECT>Window replacement for Honolulu Courthouse
<SOLNBR>GS-09P-09-KT-C-0018
<CONTACT>Gregory McSweeney, Contracting Officer, Phone 4155223121, Email greg.mcsweeney@gsa.gov - Joseph Nolan, Contracting Specialist, Phone 4155224010, Email joseph.nolan@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA Region 9, San Francisco) announces an opportunity in Construction Excellence. The General Services Administration (GSA) Region 9 proposes to replace all the windows at the Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole (PJKK) Courthouse, 300 Ala Moana Blvd, Honolulu, HI 96850.  The 136,210 GSF Courthouse is a Level IV, ISC Medium level protection structure.
The US General Services Administration (GSA) is pursuing a prudent course to protect the people visiting and working in the space in its charge.  Flying glass fragments and debris, which may be the result of numerous causes (e.g., explosions, projectile impacts, violent weather, etc.), have the potential for producing serious injury or death.  As part of its protection program, GSA initiated a Glass Fragment Retention for Windows Program to assess and retrofit, as required, the windows in its facilities to meet the Condition of 3b or lower requirements of the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Security Design Criteria.
GSA is seeking Design-Built Contractors for the design and installation of blast resistant window systems, windows resistant to glass fragmentation will be capable to serve as a moisture barrier.  The existing curtain-wall is not weather tight, and thus has become a source of moisture intrusion into the building which is a contributing factor to the operation efficiency of the HVAC system. 
The Scope of Work for the curtain-wall system includes the following:
Replacement of the existing windows (Glass and Frames only) with new blast resistant windows (Glass and Frames only).
There are five (5) different types of window configurations for a total of 5,400 SF.  Typical panes sizes are:  73 H x 58 W, 44 H x 54 W, 69 H x 42 W, 16 H x 78 W and 76 H x 57 W. The 4th floor East Side of the building may require ballistic windows.
The D-B Contractor shall have demonstrated experience with the evaluation, design and installation of protective glazing products.  The D-B Contractor shall demonstrate a track record of providing such services and products installation for large buildings.  These facilities may include federal buildings, office buildings, federal courthouse, etc.
A qualified blast consultant shall lead and perform all window vulnerability assessments.  For this work, the Contractor shall have demonstrated experience in performing work of a similar nature and scope within the past 18 months.  The Contractor shall be, or shall utilize personnel who are, familiar with the ISC blast requirements.  These personnel shall have formal training in structural dynamics, the effects of blast on structural systems and engineering analysis.  The Contractor shall be familiar with and be capable of using GSAs computer program WINGARD Version 4.1 or later.
The construction budget (ECCA) for the project is between $2,500,000 and $3,500,000
This is not a request for proposal.  Firms interested in proposing should submit a one-page letter of intent to propose for this project.    The letter of intent may be faxed to Greg McSweeney at (415) 522-3316, or e-mailed to greg.mcsweeney@gsa.gov.  Firms expressing intent will receive the Request for Proposal, including the technical factors as well as the plans and specifications in late January 2009.  The selection process will be based on the procedures in FAR Part 15.3. The RFP will include a request for both Price and Technical Proposals that include the specialized experience and technical capability of the Prime Contractor, and the Past Performance of the firm.  The lowest priced technically acceptable concept will be employed. 
The offerors will submit both technical and price proposals. The technical proposals will be reviewed to ensure that the offeror meets the minimum experience, technical and past performance criteria.  Upon completion of the technical review, the price proposals of those technically acceptable firms will be reviewed.  The lowest priced technically acceptable offer will be accepted    It is anticipated that award of the contract will be in March 2009.

Before the award of the contract the selected firm (if a large business) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established national subcontracting goals of 37% for Small Businesses, 6% for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 5% for Small Women-owned Businesses, 3% for HUB Zone Businesses, 9% for Section 8(a) Businesses and 3% for Service Disabled Veteran-owned Businesses.

Required delivery is 50 each 320 Days After contract Award (DACA) and up to 63 each year until contract completion.  This requirement is restricted to Sikorsky Aircraft (CAGE:  78286) because the design of this part is unstable.

<a href="mailto:rachael.raposa@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-New England District (Corps) is proposing to restore Broad Meadows Marsh, located south of Sea Street and the Broad Meadows School in Quincy, Massachusetts.  The Project involves the removal of approximately 40 of 65 acres of historic fill resulting from the disposal of dredged material within a diked area to restore 35 acres of salt marsh and 5.0 acres of Bordering Vegetated Wetland (BVW).  The remaining 25 acres of fill will be converted to coastal grassland habitat that will also provide passive public recreational uses.  The project is part of a joint effort between the City (the local sponsor for the Project) and the Corps to restore the Broad Meadows Marsh.  The Corps is the lead agency and will be responsible for the construction and construction management of the restored salt marsh and waterfront park.  The proposed construction activities will involve excavation of approximately 6 to 10 feet of former hydraulically dredged material (approximately 390,000 cubic yards) from the southern portion of the former dredge disposal site to achieve a sustainable salt marsh elevation between elevation 1.5 feet and 5 feet NAVD 88.  Elevated walkways will be constructed across portions of the salt marsh and will be connected to a trail network throughout the site.  The southern, excavated area will be graded to elevations to sustain approximately 10 acres of low salt marsh, 0.3 acres of salt pannes, and 20 acres of high salt marsh.  Two main tidal channels will be constructed through the marsh to provide tidal flushing to sustain a salt marsh ecosystem and provide roughly 6 acres of aquatic intertidal habitat.  The constructed channels will be aligned with the former intertidal creeks that existed before the site was filled with dredged materials.  The construction contractor will utilize low pressure heavy construction equipment suitable for salt marsh restoration work to relocate the formerly dredged material on site.  To protect water quality, the existing perimeter berm will be left in place until all of the material behind it is removed. Equipment will be located only in those areas which will need to be disturbed in order to remove portions of the berm for the main channel and to connect the restored channel to the existing channel outside the berm.  If equipment needs to go beyond the area that will be disturbed, then appropriate matting (e.g., timber mats or swamp mats) will be used for any equipment that will be staged on the existing salt marsh. As a layer of natural peat may exist under the diked area to be restored, and a natural seed source exists immediately adjacent to the restored site, the area should re-colonize with native salt marsh communities.  However, to facilitate the colonization of the salt marsh with native vegetation, the new high and low marsh areas will be planted with Spartina patens and Spartina alterniflora, respectively. The estimated cost of this work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This solicitation is 100% Set-Aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns. The NAICS code for the work is 237990 with a small business size standard of $31 million. The solicitation shall be made available via the Internet (www.fbo.gov) on or about 11 August 2008. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendments, if any, will be available at this Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted. All responsible HUBZone Small Business concerns may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency. Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format. Submitted quotes shall have the contractors Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency. All quotations must be received not later than 5 AUG 2008, 5:00 P.M.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Ibrahim Barham,Chairman and CEO, Sharekat Safad Engineering & Electronics Ltd., P.O. Box 1811, Ramallah, West Bank, Phone: 970 2 295-7229,
Fax: 970 2 298-0142.

West Bank - Internet Data Center Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Sharekat Safad Engineering & Electronics Ltd. (Safad) for deployment of the first dedicated Internet Data Center (IDC) facility in the West Bank.

Safad is a major systems integrator and IT solutions provider with principal offices in Ramallah, West Bank.  The firm was founded in 1992 and has three principal lines of business:  equipment distribution; systems and solutions integration; and services and support.  Technicians at Safad are certified in Oracle, Red Hat ITIL, PMI and other advanced technology environments.  Safad clearly has the technical expertise to own and operate an advanced data center and web hosting facility but it needs assistance with an operational plan for an IDC.  The services the new IDC may offer, following the recommendations of the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) study, include: web hosting, co-location, application hosting, virtual dedicated servers, managed security, shared storage, disaster data recovery, real-time data replication, network and application outsourcing, internet services (ISP), e-mail and database services, software as a service, internet exchange point, voice peering (for VOIP conversations), and other professional services.

The implementation of this project would allow for domestic Internet hosting services, which is currently supplied only as an ancillary service by a Palestinian Internet Service Provider.  Today local companies have no choice but to seek hosting solutions in other countries, leading to an outflow of capital.   Furthermore, a local data center provider would lower telecommunications connectivity charges.

The proposed grant for the IDC will combine technological planning with management consulting and specialized advisory on service definition, marketing, customer care, and business operations.  The specific objective of the project will be to:

1)	Assess market demand for advanced data center services by conducting empirical interviews with enterprises, and creating a market segmentation and forecast model;
2)	Develop a reference architecture for Safads planned IDC, including refining the scope and functional parameters of the IDC as well as operational procedures;
3)	Define products and services for the IDC including service definitions, functional parameters, marketing materials, and other supporting information to enable Safad to quickly introduce advanced web services to the market;  
4)	Introduce Safad to vendors and operators of data centers through an orientation visit to the U.S. to become familiar with international best practices and latest technological innovations; and
5)	Formalize the business plan including business description and risk analysis, long term development options, pro forma financial forecasts, and related metrics, to help ensure that the Safad IDC becomes a commercial success.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $412,093 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm, February 9, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Veterans Administration (VA), Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center, 155 Van Gordon Street, Lakewood, CO, 80228, intends to solicit for proposals from well qualified experienced sources from any size businesses that are capable of providing one or more of the following types of hearing aids:  Group 1 - Custom Digital Hearing Aids; Group 2 - Behind-the-Ear Digital Hearing Aids (standard, and open ear fitting behind-the-ear); Group 3 - Receiver-in-the-canal Digital Hearing Aids; Group 4 - CROS, BICROS and Multi-CROS Wireless Programmable Hearing Aids; and Group 5 - Hearing Aid Remote Controls (optional devices).  Remote controls must be compatible with hearing aids offered in Group 1-4 that are offered and determined to be considered for an award.  Offerors that do not receive an award in one or more Groups will not receive consideration on remote controls.  No more than one award will be made for on a model/brand.The VA DALC anticipates making one or more fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract awards in each Group (1-4) to afford competition and cover the needs of the Government.  The contracted items will be a mandatory source for VA Audiology and Speech Pathology Services at the VA Medical Centers.  Other Government agencies (such as Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, Health & Human Services and Bureau of Prisons) may use any awarded contract as a non-mandatory source.  The requirements also cover primary and secondary features, extra components, programming software and training related to the hearing aids.  Current ISO 9000 certification for the manufacturing facility will be required; along with adapted measures to ensure that any personally identifiable information (PII) associated with individual veterans is adequately protected from loss, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure.The contract period will be November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010, with four one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the VA DALC.  Subject procurement is being procured as a commercial item as defined in FAR Part 12.  Subject contracts award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 12 and 15.  Subject announcement is provided in order to satisfy the requirements of FAR Part 5.  The North American Classification Code is 334510 and Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  The requirement package will be issued as a "full and open" solicitation for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entity who can meet the requirements.  The acquisition will be procured as a "Best Value" type of acquisition where price and other-non-price factors allow for evaluation trade-offs to achieve the best value contracts for the government.  Non-priced factors (technical, experience and capacity, past performance and veteran programs), when combined, will be considered significantly more important than price.  Solicitation documents will be available electronically on or about January 14, 2009 at the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  NO HARD COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.  The anticipated RFP closing date is February 19, 2009 at 4:00 p.m. (Mountain Time).  The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Gail A Hixon (gail.hixon@va.gov).

<CONTACT>Yvette L. Wilson, Contract Specialist, Email yvette.wilson@us.af.mil - Charles J Briggs, Contracting Officer, Email charles.briggs@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>a. The Military Satellite Communications Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to host an Industry Day for a potential acquisition of the Transformational Satellite Communication System (TSAT) Block 10 Development and Production on Friday, 16 Jan 09. The purpose of Industry Day is to present a TSAT Block 10 concept, discuss Block 10 issues, and participate in one-on-one question and answer sessions with potential offerors. The morning session will include a program overview for Block 10 to include a potential acquisition strategy and draft solicitation highlights, followed by one-on-one sessions in the afternoon with interested potential prime contractors and their subcontractors/teammates. The morning session will be held at The Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A-1 Conference Hall, Room 1062, 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245 starting at 0800 hrs (8:00 A.M.) PST. Information on the times for the one-on-one afternoon sessions will be provided directly to the requester in accordance with the below scheduling instructions.
<p>b. The draft solicitation and all available supporting documentation will be available for review on the TSAT Bidders Library starting Tuesday, 23 Dec 08 at 1700 hrs (5:00 P.M.) PST. See below for instructions on how to access the Bidders Library.</p>
<p>c. As seating is limited, registration is required for attendance. The number of attendees per company is limited to eight (8). Small Businesses are encouraged to participate. The applicable size standard for this requirement is 1,000 employees. NAICS information is available for review at: http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf. Potential subcontractors may attend the one-on-one session with their associated potential prime, if said sessions are scheduled. If potential subcontractors attend the one-on-one session, the contractor attendees for the one-on-one session will be increased to twelve (12) participants. Potential offeror(s) can register for the conference and schedule an appointment for a one-on-one session by contacting Lt Joseph Kim at joseph.kim@losangeles.af.mil, or Lt Rick Paz at jose.paz@losangeles.af.mil, (310) 653-9406. The one-on-one session must be scheduled by 1700 (5:00 P.M.), PST on Wednesday, 7 Jan 09. Interested contractors may submit questions for the one-on-one session and all draft RFP documents no later than 1200 hrs (12:00 P.M.) PST on Friday, 9 Jan 09 via e-mail by attaching the form titled "RFP Comments for Bidder's Library" located on the Bidders Library to Mr. Charles Briggs and Ms. Yvette Wilson. All Visitor Clearances should be faxed to the Visitor Control fax at (310) 653-9554 or submitted via SMO Code "MCS WING". Requests should specify "Attn: Lt Joseph Kim, TSAT Space Industry Day" and contain the following:</p>
<p>(1) Name;<br />(2) Social Security Number (SSAN);<br />(3) Date of Birth (DOB);<br />(4) Place of Birth (POB);<br />(5) Citizenship;<br />(6) Clearance Level;<br />(7) Clearance Investigation Date;<br />(8) Clearance Granting Agency;<br />(9) Member's Company-Organization;<br />(10) Meeting Subject;<br />(11) Meeting Location;<br />(12) Visit Dates;<br />(13) MCSW Sponsor and Cage Code (for industry).</p>
<p>All meetings will be held at DoD Secret level.</p>
<p>d. The Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) will provide DoD with high data rate Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) and Internet-like services as defined in the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA). TSAT is essential to global net-centric operations. As the spaceborne element of the Global Information Grid (GIG), it will extend the GIG to users without terrestrial connections, providing improved connectivity and data transfer capability, vastly improving satellite communications for the warfighter. TSAT's Internet Protocol (IP) routing will connect thousands of users through networks rather than limited point-to-point connections.</p>
<p>e. The scope of this acquisition will be for the development and production of TSAT Block 10 Space Vehicles (SVs), and the ground command and control element. The space vehicle would be designed in a manner providing graceful growth and modularity, so in a potential, future follow-on TSAT program, capabilities could be scaled to achieve increased requirements.</p>
<p>f. After Industry Day, in order for the Government to ascertain potential offerors' understanding and capability to successfully execute this program, all interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 1700 hrs (5:00 P.M.) PST on Friday, 23 Jan 09, demonstrating an understanding of the baseline Block 10 TSAT requirements. The SOC should include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) Detailed understanding of the TSAT requirements;<br />(2) Capability to assist the Government in maturing, defining, and refining requirements;<br />(3) Ability to conduct quick-turn engineering trades and analysis;<br />(4) Implementation of System Engineering Tools (DOORS, etc);<br />(5) Robust Earned Value Management Reporting Capability (Tools, Processes, etc);<br />(6) Any relevant space communications, integration, and/or engineering experience; <br />(7) Staffing / resource allocation plan indicating that you have the resources available to meet the Government's requirements on a timely and cost-effective basis;<br />(8) Capability to develop, integrate, test and manufacture the Block 10 SVs for an Initial Launch Capability (ILC) of 2nd Quarter FY 2019;<br />(9) Capability to grow the Block 10 spacecraft and system in a graceful manner to field subsequent blocks of vehicles with capability up to and including that specified as threshold capability for the original TSAT Block 2 system.</p>
<p>Further instructions on the SOC requirements and delivery instructions will be provided at Industry Day.</p>
<p>g. The draft RFP and all future announcements, updates, and unclassified information for this proposed acquisition will be available exclusively on the TSAT Bidders Library. Other unclassified and non-proprietary documents will also be available through the Bidders Library as they become available. No further announcements are anticipated to be made on Fed Biz Ops prior to announcement of a final RFP release. Potential offerors are responsible for staying abreast of the contents posted on Bidders Library. Contractors may request access to the Bidders Library by contacting Lt Joseph Kim at joseph.kim@losangeles.af.mil, or Lt Rick Paz at jose.paz@losangeles.af.mil, (310) 653-9406, and must agree to sign a Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA) prior to accessing the Bidders Library. The required Non-disclosure Agreement form can be acquired by emailing Lt Joseph Kim or Lt Rick Paz. Requests for classified documents will be submitted to SMC/MCSG (Space Segment), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lt Joseph Kim. Since access to classified and critical technologies will be required for this effort, we expect that foreign firms will be authorized only for non-restricted portions of the acquisition.</p>
<p>h. This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.</p>

The Government is notresponsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. Respondents will notbe notified of the results of any government assessments.  All information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Governmentfor program planning and acquisition strategy development. As stipulated in FAR15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted bythe Government to form a binding contract. If a solicitation is released in the future,it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  Thisis a 2 step process requiring a Notice of Intent by January 5, 2009 and a White PaperResponse to the RFI by January 16, 2009.NASA is developing potential proposals for the upcoming New Frontiers ProgramAnnouncement of Opportunity (2009) that involve multiple strategies for Venusexploration.   Many of the suggested mission concepts aim to deliver scientific payloadsthrough the atmosphere of Venus to the surface.  Four options are being considered thatlikely require parachute systems:  a  lander, a deployed balloon reconnaissance platform,a large probe, and a smaller probe. A key component of these options is a Venus parachutesubsystem. It is highly desirable that this subsystem have a strong heritage to previousplanetary missions, and especially those implemented in the past 15 years.  Thisannouncement supersedes any previously released RFI.  Each of the four primary optionshas a unique set of elements, as summarized below.For the Venus Lander, the backshell will be ejected and a single canopy will be deployedat an altitude of ~ 65-67 km and a velocity of ~Mach 0.8.  The atmospheric entryinterface heat shield will be jettisoned after parachute deployment.  The Venus Lander isto touch down in approximately 50 minutes from parachute deployment at an impact velocityof less than 10 m/s.  The entry vehicle mass (backshell, Lander, and heat-shield) will be800 to 1000 kg, and the Lander mass will be no more than 695 kg. For the Balloon Reconnaissance Platform, the backshell will be ejected and a singlecanopy will be deployed by a mortar at an altitude of ~ 60 km and a velocity of Mach  0.8to 1.2.  The heat shield will be dropped, and approximately 10 seconds after theparachute is deployed, inflation of the balloon will begin.  Approximately 30 secondsafter the parachute is deployed, the Balloon Reconnaissance Platform will be releasedfrom the parachute.  The speed at release should be less than 50 m/s.For the Larger Probe, a mortar will deploy a pilot parachute which will carry off thebackshell and deploy the main canopy.  This system will utilize a 300-500 kg total flightsystem mass and deploy the parachute at ~ 60-65 km for later release around 50km. Theparachute subsystem will consist of two basic groupings of components: a mortar deployedpilot parachute for backshell separation and main parachute deployment; and a mainparachute for heat shield separation and descent speed control. Deployment will occur ata velocity of ~Mach 0.8.  The heat shield will be jettisoned approximately 5 secondsafter main parachute deployment. The main parachute will be jettisoned at an altitude of15 to 30  km.For the Small Probe, a mortar will deploy a single canopy which will carry off thebackshell and extract the Small Probe pressure vessel from the aeroshell. This systemwill utilize a 85-120  kg total flight system mass and deploy the parachute at ~ 60-65 kmfor later release around 50 km. The parachute subsystem will consist of two basicgroupings of components: a mortar deployed pilot parachute for backshell separation andmain parachute deployment; and a main parachute for heat shield separation and descentspeed control. Other components are similar to the large probes described above.Requirements for the development of the parachute subsystem for each of the four optionsabove may include the following: 1. Sufficient ground testing to establish the function and reliability of the mortardeployment assembly. 2. Ground and flight testing to validate the strength and performance of the pilot andmain parachutes. 3. Appropriate flight tests to establish the function and reliability of the completeparachute subsystem (from mortar firing to post heat shield separation in one test) atrelevant conditions (Mach=0.8 and equivalent deployment initiation density). 4. Appropriate documentation of the parachute subsystem including stress reports,performance reports, and mechanical interface engineering reports. 5. It is anticipated that the requirements will include delivery of one flight ready unitto NASA for vehicle integration no earlier than, 2015. RFI Requirements and Preparation of White Paper responses.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
This Sources Sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to identify small businesses such as 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the description and Statement of Work (SOW) below.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS code 541712.
This is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  No solicitation is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Synopsis.  No collect telephone calls will be accepted.
DESCRIPTION
The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), NIH, is seeking small businesses that possess the ability to construct, implant, and perform subject tests with a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) able to acquire multiunit neural signals from 50 or more sites in the brain of subjects severely impaired in their ability to speak or otherwise communicate.  Specialized devices, subject tests, and training procedures shall be developed to optimize use of this communication prosthesis in appropriate patient populations.
STATEMENT OF WORK
Background:
NIDCD held a workshop in May, 2006, to evaluate brain-computer interfaces (BCI) which could be used to control speech synthesis software and other forms of assistive technology that support the communication needs of patients who are locked in.  During these discussions of the existing technology and its potential use for this application, the workshop participants agreed that the merit of this approach had been proven through a number of animal studies and a limited number of tests with human subjects.  Human studies with BCIs have already demonstrated the ability to control computer cursor movements over two dimensions, and these results have been translated into a means for human subjects to control movement of a robotic arm.  Patient testing and signal analysis techniques already employed for these studies provide a solid foundation for development of a BCI.
Two areas were identified for additional development.  First, studies in human subjects are required to determine the appropriate placement of the recording electrodes for acquisition of neural activity that can be modulated to provide control signals appropriate for communication tasks.  Specialized subject testing and training procedures are required for use when testing patients for this application.  Second, specialized audiovisual output devices are likely to be required in order to optimize the subjects ability to communicate through a BCI, and additional development of signal extraction algorithms is likely to facilitate the acquisition of user control signals from a BCI.
NIDCD is requesting proposals that focus on acquiring neural response data and assessment of BCI device capabilities through studies with human subjects.  This initiative will support investigations of electrode placement in different regions of the brain and speech motor nerve pathways and development of subject testing techniques that are optimized for communication prostheses.  Chronic studies in patients with brainstem stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are of particular interest.
Objective:
The contractor shall construct and implant a research Brain Computer Interface (BCI) able to acquire signals based on neural activity and function as a communication prosthesis for subjects with severe impairments in their ability to speak or otherwise communicate.  Specialized subject testing and training procedures shall be developed to optimize use of the prosthesis in appropriate patient populations. 
Work to be performed: 
A. Fabricate or obtain a surgically implantable device with multiple electrodes able to sense single and/or multiunit neural activity and convey this signal outside of the subjects body. 
1.	The electrode design shall allow for placement of at least 100 distinct recording sites and support signal acquisition from independent populations of neurons. 2.	The signal from each electrode site shall be conveyed outside of the subjects body with a minimum of predefined signal processing, such as that provided by a percutaneous connector. 3.	Since FDA approval for investigational use of this device in human studies will be required, electrodes and devices which already have this approval shall be used when possible.  Enhancement of this component can be proposed over the course of the project. 
B. Fabricate or obtain components that can be placed outside the subject to amplify the signal recorded from each electrode site and convey this signal to outside processing components. 
1.	This device shall be constructed to ensure patient safety during BCI operation, regardless of any functions that might be performed by subsequent components of the signal processing chain. 2.	The following data shall be recorded during subject tests for subsequent offline re-analysis: unprocessed signals acquired from each electrode, extracted neural activity, decoded signals believed to be under the subjects control, and the communication result intended by the subject. 3.	Sharing of recorded data from some patient test sessions shall be made available to outside researchers; this activity will be coordinated with the NIDCD project officer. 
C. Fabricate or obtain hardware and software components which are able to detect neural activity in real time and decode subject-modulated signals.

<SUBJECT>Scientific Echo Sounder System
<SOLNBR>NRMAF000-9-03866SLW
<RESPDATE>010509
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI (GLERL) intends to award a Purchase Order to Biosonics, Inc for a scientific echo-sounder system. The scientific echo-sounder system will be used for collection of acoustic backscatter information from targets as varied as zooplankton, larger invertebrates (e.g. squid and jellyfish), fish, and marine mammals. This backscatter information will be analyzed for determination of target distribution (fish size), biomass, abundance, and behavior. The system must be capable of translating acoustic data into more quantitative and meaningful information such as animal size, abundance, and swimming speed. This fisheries acoustics system must be Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) compatible, coupled with a dual-axis rotator system, controlled by semi-automated software, utilizing real-time processing and reporting for communications to shore via a wireless connection. Two, discrete, frequencies will allow data to be processed (on shore) after collection for determination of differential frequency response from different organisms. A Biosonics Fisheries Acoustics system is imperative, as researchers must be able to compare future and current data with data collected over the past 8 years using Biosonics systems. Consistent and comparable data are extremely important in a research setting where long-term trends are important. Currently, there are three major vendors of fisheries acoustics systems - Biosonics Inc, Simrad, and HTI. About 7 years ago, we performed a comparative study between the three fisheries acoustics systems and found that the data were not comparable. The primary issue was the inability to detect a similar number of single acoustic targets across platforms using a common digital signal processing software package - Echoview. Moreover, the Biosonics Fisheries Acoustics system is the only fisheries acoustics system to digitize the signal at the sensor interface (transducer). This is important as it provides a greater signal to noise ratio then competing systems and thus allows us to detect smaller acoustic targets that may occur in the noise range of the other systems. This difference in signal to noise ratio will result in differences in recorded mean fish size and thus bias estimates of size frequency distributions and abundance. In order to maintain comparability with past data collections, it is essential that GLERL remain with the same vendor of our current fisheries acoustics systems. At GLERL, we maintain two Biosonics fisheries acoustics systems (single frequency split beam system, and a dual frequency split beam system).<br />II. Specifications: The contractor must supply a fisheries acoustic system that meets the following requirements:
<p>a) Digital scientific echo sounder system equipped with one 70 KHz frequency ` with expansion option for an additional 120 KHz frequency. <br />b) Split beam digital transducers.<br />c) Underwater housing for deployment in depths up to 200m.<br />d) Compatibility with Ethernet interface; IEEE 802.3<br />e) Internal data storage and onboard processing.<br />f) Custom software for automated system operation and monitoring.<br />g) Custom software for target analysis and reporting.<br />h) Energy-saving system modifications for buoy deployment<br />i) Dual-axis rotator system (pan and tilt) for aiming and scanning of the transducers.<br />j) Manual and automated scanning operations.</p>
<p>II. (1) Software. The system proposed here will add advanced software for system operation, control, and analysis appropriate to a buoy-deployed situation. This software will include:</p>
<p>a. System operation monitoring: To power availability, the system will be programmable and function in an automated mode which will acoustically monitor the environment utilizing limited power and to analyze data for presence of targets of interest (in this case, lake trout and whitefish). System status will be monitored and reported on a regular basis.</p>
<p>b. Automated area-scanning system: Enabling the transducer(s) to automatically or manually scan a wide area near the buoy. This will allow coverage of the vicinity of the buoy from full-depth below to approximately 250m in all directions to the sides of the buoy. This will also allow the system to concentrate sampling in the areas where fish of interest are most abundant and/or active. On detection of targets of interest (via automated data processing), the system will change operational parameters to more fully sample the environment and the presence and distribution of targets of interest.</p>
<p>c. Onboard data storage of operational and detection information for archiving and additional analysis.</p>
<p>d. Automated Data Processing: Software for collection, storage, and analysis of data for presence, abundance, size, and distribution of targets of interest will be run continuously to provide near-real-time analysis of acoustic data.</p>
<p>e. Automated reporting of relevant information via buoy-system remote connection to shore-based receiving system.</p>
<p>II. (2) Functionality. The system will:</p>
<p>a. Automatically (or manual override) monitor the area of interest, using two discrete acoustic frequencies, in a low-power / low-data volume mode to detect the presence or absence of targets of interest.</p>
<p>b. Send regular system status reports to the system operator utilizing existing buoy communications system.</p>
<p>c. On detection of pre-determined levels of target presence, the system will:<br />1. Send an alert message to the system operator (via existing buoy communications system) indicating that targets have been detected. <br />2. Automatically modify data interrogation and collection protocol to increase sample rate and volume (to pre-determined levels) while fish of interest are in the vicinity.<br />3. Send regular summaries of target abundance, distribution, and acoustic target strength and system status to the operator (via existing buoy communications system).</p>
<p>d. On detection of reduced of fish abundance (based on results of automated data processing), the system will:<br />1. Send an alert message to the system operator indicating that target levels have decreased.<br />2. Automatically modify data interrogation and collection protocol to decrease sampling rate and volume.</p>
<p>II. (3) Hardware Specifications:</p>
<p>Detailed specifications of scientific fisheries acoustics system include:<br />&bull; 70 kHz Split-Beam Weather Resistant Digital Echo sounders with programmable Linux embedded processor and acquisition software. In addition, echo sounder must have:</p>
<p>o Ethernet control expandable to wireless capabilities<br />o Weather resistant laptop computer (Panasonic ToughBook 29, Pentium M 738-1.4GHZ V Centrino, 13.3 transmissive touch XGA, 256MB, 60GB HD, WLAN802.11a+b+g, WinXP SP2 w/ CD-RW/DVD-ROM Combo Drive; with acquisition software installed, configured and tested) compatible with echosounder, to operate echosounder and to record digital acoustic data<br />o Integrated Differential GPS<br />o Expandability up to a total of 5 different frequencies with multiplexing capabilities from the single surface echosounder<br />o Noise floor of less than -145 dB<br />o Programmable and variable ping rate to 20 pings per second<br />o Instantaneous dynamic range to 160 dB.<br />o Power: 10-14 VDC @ 20Watts</p>

GLERL has invested in Echoview licenses and buys yearly software support current the data infrastructure.</p>
<p>To be considered interested parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to meet or exceed the specifications herein. Firms must furnish detailed specifications and descriptions to demonstrate their capability to provide the scientific echo sounder system and satisfy the Government's needs. Capability information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number, and address of concerns for which you have previously furnished this supply, and detailed narrative that describes your ability to provide this supply as specified and descriptive literature. Interested parties must respond within (7) seven days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to the only known source, Biosonics, Inc.</p>

The magnitude of this acquisition is estimated to not exceed $600,000.00. (v) Pricing must be provided for the following line items:Line Item 0001     Mapping quality metric - medium format aerial imaging system, Quantity - 1 Lump SumLine Item 0002     Flight Planning Software, Quantity - 2 EachLine Item 0003     Image Processing Software, Quantity - 2 EachLine Item 0004     Installation/Maintenance, Quantity - 1 Lump SumLine Item 0005     Training, Quantity - 1 Lump Sum
(vi) Description of requirements:
1.  Acquisition of the camera system will include:1.1.  System installation - camera mounting must provide a seal sufficient to minimize loss of cabin heat to allow camera operation below 0 degree Celsius outside air temperature.1.2.  Operator hardware/software training and manuals (2 sets/2 licenses)1.3.  Mission Planning Software (2 sets/2 licenses)1.3.  Mission Navigation Software (1 set)
2.  Background2.1  For over 100 years the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has used aerial reconnaissance in the forms of direct observation and remote sensing to meet its legislated responsibilities (e.g., especially those outlined in the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and Migratory Bird Conservation Act).  Over the past 17 years, the Service has met some of these responsibilities using an analog, film-based aerial camera (Jena LMK2000) operated onboard Service aircraft.  This in-house capability has equipped the Service to accomplish small and time sensitive aerial surveys of federal trust species and their habitats, research and development projects, emergency response activities related to natural disasters and the subsequent damage assessment, and law enforcement activities involving chain of custody elements.  These surveys are conducted year-round throughout the U.S. and Canada, requiring a system that can be operated in a variety of harsh climates and remote areas.  These surveys meet legislated responsibilities and do not compete against traditional professional mapping surveys, which the Service continues to use.
2.2  Due to the age of the analog camera and the shift to digital image acquisition and interpretation, the Service is seeking a medium-format digital aerial imaging system to replace the analog camera.  It is the Service's objective that this replacement system will afford an improved capability to meet the Service's legislated responsibilities with increased safety, efficiency, and effectiveness.  Even though the criteria list below is quite extensive, many of the commercial digital aerial imaging systems will exceed the criteria in some cases and not meet the criteria in other cases.  The Service also has a limited budget for this acquisition therefore all offers will be evaluated based on the criteria and the cost of the system.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  A written proposal will be issued.  The solicitation number is W912EQ-09-R-0003. This acquisition is issued as a request for Proposal. This acquisition is set aside 100% for small businesses. The associated NAICS code is 541620 with a size of $7.0M. The following is a list of contract line item number(s): CLIN 0001: Rivervale Outlet Ditch Mussel Survey Task 1; CLIN 0002  Rivervale Outlet Ditch Mussel Survey Task 2.<BR>  <BR>Contractors shall submit a lump sum quotation to include all chargers. The government intends to evaluate proposals based on technical capabilities, personnel qualification, past performance and price related factors. Quotes may be submitted in hard copy or electronically, either through regular mail, email, or by facsimile. Regardless of the method of delivery, it is the offerors responsibility to ensure receipt of quotes by the time and date stated herein. STATEMENT OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment required to perform work that may include, but not be limited to, the following work items in accordance with specific task orders issued by the Contracting officer:<BR><BR>1. The Contractor shall, within 30 days after issuance of a task order, conduct surveys (qualitative and/or quantitative) in a manner agreed upon in each task order to determine the presence/absence of endangered mussels, provide density estimates of endangered mussels, translocate populations of endangered mussels, and provide other services that may be required by the Memphis District relating to endangered mussel populations.  Variables such as weather, flood events or other unforeseen circumstances may delay implementation of work without penalty to the contractor.  <BR><BR>Task 1.<BR><BR>a.  Quantitative sampling of approximately 5.2 miles of Rivervale Outlet Ditch, located north of Marked Tree, Arkansas.  The average width of this ditch is 80 feet.  The Memphis District has proposed to cleanout portions of this ditch.  The federally endangered freshwater mussel Potamilus capax was recently collected in this ditch during a preliminary reconnaissance survey. Quantitative sampling will include a sufficient number of replicate samples to adequately estimate population densities of both T&E species and non-endangered mussels. The report shall include number and location (GPS data) of all P. capax collected during the survey and a population estimate for P. capax for the area surveyed.<BR><BR><BR>b.  If during the course of formal consultation between the Memphis District USACE and the USFWS it is decided that translocation of endangered mussels is required, the contractor will be responsible for collecting and moving any endangered mussels found in the reach.  When translocating endangered mussels, sufficient personnel will be present to collect the required numbers of the target species from the reach.  Techniques employed will ensure maximum coverage of the substrate.  For example, personnel may be deployed in a line perpendicular with the channel in such a manner as to have a six-inch overlap in their survey area.  In this manner, the entire substrate can be covered without gaps.  Specific requirements relating to translocation will be described in the Biological Opinion supplied by the USFWS.  Translocation reports will include total number collected, mortalities (if any), GPS data on translocation sites, numbers placed at each site (if appropriate), the number of trips the contractor made to transport the mussels, average time to transport the mussels, temperature of water, and average water depths.  <BR><BR>Task 2.<BR><BR>The Memphis District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to build a 1,640 cfs pump station to divert water from the White River near DeValls Bluff in Monroe County Arkansas for agricultural irrigation purposes.  An Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Assessment have previously been completed on the overall Grand Prairie Area Demonstration Project (GPADP), and a previous study conducted in 2001 by Miller et al., found no endangered freshwater mussels within the survey reach.  However, due to the length of time since that survey, and additional concerns regarding alterations to current velocities, changes in water elevations, and other potential hydrologic impacts, an additional study is needed.   <BR><BR>Study Area:  The study area for this survey will encompass two mussel beds in the vicinity of DeValls Bluff, Arkansas.  Figure 1 shows the location of the survey reach. <BR>The two mussel beds in the White River are approximately 625 M2 (upstream bed) and 1500 M2 (downstream bed).<BR><BR>Objective:  The objective of this study will be to conduct quantitative and qualitative surveys on two mussel beds in the vicinity of the proposed GPADP pump station. Information gathered in this effort will be used during the project monitoring process to determine whether project operations are impacting the mussel community in the survey area.  A previous study (Harris 1989) found the endangered Lampsilis abrupta present in the downstream mussel bed.  The initial monitoring effort (2005) found evidence of Potamilus capax (shells) but encountered no live specimens.  <BR><BR>Methodology and Sites:  An inter-agency team made up of Bill Posey (AGFC), Joe Krystofik and Chris Davidson (USFWS), Corps personnel, and a private industry malacologist met at DeValls Bluff, Arkansas and determined the sampling methods and areal extent of the survey.  Both quantitative and qualitative sampling will be conducted on the known mussel beds (Figure1). <BR><BR>Quantitative surveys will be conducted using a 0.25 meter quadrat.  At least 1% of the total area of each bed will be quantitatively sampled.  Each sample will consist of all material within the quadrat to a depth of 15 centimeters.  This material will be transported to the surface, processed through a sieve, and all unionids will be collected.   Mussels will be identified, enumerated, and returned to the approximate point of collection.  The lengths of the beds will be measured and the upstream and downstream limits of the beds will be delineated in decimal degrees using a GPS unit.  Spot dives will be conducted on the beds in order to estimate species richness.  At least fifteen, 15-minute dives will be conducted on each mussel bed.<BR><BR>General Contractor Requirements.<BR><BR>1.Coordination:  To the maximum extent possible, coordination will be done by telephone.   When in the field, the Contractor will submit a daily status report and dive schedule for the next day.  A safety meeting will be conducted prior to the start of work.  Site visits will be arranged for inter-agency team members and the Corps Dive Coordinator(if required) while surveys are being conducted.  The Contractor may be required to attend meetings with Corps and other resource agencies in Memphis, TN  to discuss scope of work, sampling locations, survey status, etc.<BR>2. Schedule and Deliverables:  <BR>All work shall be completed not later than _____.   Note: If required, a dive safety plan must be approved prior to start of fieldwork.  Site specific plan shall be submitted with Contractors proposal.<BR><BR>a.  Written assessments for environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, and biological assessments or other project documents.<BR><BR>b.  Preparation of technical reports containing results of work items accomplished under this contract.<BR><BR>Tasks to be performed are in partial fulfillment of the Memphis Districts obligations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; as amended, and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.<BR><BR>Personnel Standards.  <BR>	<BR>a.

<p><strong>AMENDMENT 001</strong>- THE FOLLOWING CLARIFICATIONS ARE PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO VENDOR QUESTIONS, READ BELOW:</p>
<p><span>
<p>QUESTION: Our company is interested in subject solicitation and want to know if Federal Excise Tax should be added to our price quote and if it is applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Although 26 U.S.C. Section 4181 imposes an excise tax on the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of "...shells and cartridges," 26 U.S.C. 4182 provides that "No ... shells and cartridges purchased with funds appropriated for the military department shall be subject to any tax imposed on the sale or transfer of such articles." Thus, it is our opinion that no excise tax is due. Please note that this is the opinion of our in-house legal counsel and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. In taking any position with respect to taxes, recommend that you consult your own tax counsel.</p>
<p>THE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF QUOTES IS NOT EXTENDED.</p>
<p>DUE DATE AND TIME REMAINS 22 DEC 2008, NO LATER THAN 1:00PM(EST).</p>

<DESC>Question 1: Would the government consider an approach that is based on a Government off the Shelf (GOTS) solution?<BR>Answer 1: No, a GOTS solution will not be considered for this procurement.<BR><BR>Question 2:  Demo Scenario Document:<BR>Answer 2:  Please resend the latest Demo Scenario Document.  There is no updated demo scenario document but what was previously furnished.  <BR><BR>Question 3: Upon review, I noticed that NAICS code 541512 referenced on the solicitation has a $25M cap in revenue, in order to be considered a small business.  Our company is a value added reseller of software products and services and thus our Gross Revenues are much higher than $25M, although, since we arent a manufacturer we are under 100 employees.  In researching NAICS code 541512, I found a cross reference with NAICS code 423430 for establishments primarily engaged in wholesaling computer hardware and software products and providing supporting services.  Under NAICS codes 423430, a company is considered a small business if they have less than 100 employees.  Would the cross-reference of NAICS code 541512 and 423430 allow our company to meet the small business set aside requirement and thus submit a proposal?<BR>Answer 3: The NAICS code 541512 will remain the same since there are services required under this effort, and does not fall under suggested code 423430, nor can it be cross referenced for solicitation purposes. The task within this solicitation contains technical support services and training, so therefore its not lending itself to a NAICS code for product based on number of employees.<BR><BR>Questions 4: We have been researching potential partners to work with and one had mentioned/heard that this RFP had been cancelled.  Can you confirm that this is still a valid/current RFP?<BR>Answer 4: Yes, the RFP is valid under FEDBIZOPPS.<BR><BR>Question 5: Part III Price Proposal states that the labor categories represent the governments best estimate of required labor.  Offeror shall estimate the hours to accommodate the solution.  Does the government require that only these stated labor categories be utilized or will the government allow for additional labor categories to accommodate an offerors solution?<BR>Answer 5: Additional labor categories are allowed to accommodate a solution. .  If you intend to use other labor categories that you feel are consistent or offer better solution  to  the PWS,  please be sure that you cross map those labor categories to the Governments PWS, to ensure your proposal receives a proper evaluation.  <BR> <BR>Question 6: In the PWS, Task 4 is listed as both Interface Development (6.4) and Training and Support (6.5).  Is Training and Support Task 4 or should it be Task 5?<BR>Answer 6: Yes.  6.5 Task 4 - Training and Support  should be 6.5 Task 5 -<BR>Training and Support.<BR><BR>Question 7: Paragraph 6.4.1 says the contractor will use interface control documents (ICD) to interface with 11 systems that are listed.  Paragraph 6.4.2 cites the same 11 systems as requiring interface files.  Also, paragraph 6.4.3 references use of the GEX system to system interfaces, whereby GEX will be used as the primary integration hub until Web Services are available to automatically push and pull transactional documents.  Are all the required interfaces among those cited in Paragraphs 6.4.1 through 6.4.3?  Or are additional interfaces required, e.g. to current funding distribution and ERP systems?<BR>Answer 7: Additional interfaces will be required.<BR><BR>Question 8: For PWS task 6.5, Training and Support, how many users is the EFD solution expected to train and support?  Where would these users be geographically located?<BR>Answer 8: Thousands of users, world-wide, will use the EFD solution.<BR><BR>Question 9: For PWS task 6.3, Reports Development, will the contractor be working with BTA SMEs to define final report designs, or will the contractor need to reach out to stakeholders at the DoD services to finalize the designs?<BR>Answer 9: During proposal phase, the contractor will define reports; after award the<BR>contractor will work with BTA SMEs. <BR><BR>Question 10: Instruction to Offerors: Part 1  Technical Proposal  In this paragraph on Page 2, there is mention of Attachment 1 and 2. Please provide Attachment 1.<BR>Answer 10:  Attachment 1 is the PWS.  Para you refer to should state Attachment 1 and 4. <BR> <BR>Question 11  14 reserved<BR><BR>Question 15: Does the Government own licenses to any of the FSIO-compliant tools that will be available for this project?<BR>Answer 15: Not applicable.<BR><BR>Question 16: For the purposes of pricing COTS software licenses, please provide the following information:<BR>Question 16a: How many users will need the capability to enter and edit transactions (e.g., perform funds distributions)? <BR>Answer 16a: Initially approximately 50 users; potentially hundreds.<BR>Question 16b: How many users will need the capability to just query data or run<BR>reports?<BR>Answer 16b: Initially approximately 200 users; potentially several hundred.  <BR>Question 16c: How many users need the capability to create reports?<BR>Answer 16c: Initially approximately 50 users; potentially hundreds.<BR>Question 16d: We assume the option year prices for software licenses are for<BR>software maintenance.  Please confirm.<BR>Answer 16d: Option year prices for software licenses include software <BR>maintenance. <BR><BR>Question 17: Section 9 of the PWS Place of Performance states The vendor shall perform all tasks and deliverables within the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.  Section 12 states The Government will provide office required facilities, equipment, and materials for daily business use of staff called for under this order.  Finally, the Instructions to Offerors states All work under these tasks will be performed at Government facilities at Crystal City, VA.  Please confirm where the Government expects the work to be performed. If the work is to be performed at the Government facility, will the Government provide the necessary hardware and software for the development and testing environments, configuration management, etc?  Is the place of performance expected to remain the same for all tasks and through all phases of the project (e.g. beyond IOC)?<BR>Answer 17: The vendor will provide software for the development and testing environments, configuration management, etc.  The work will be performed in the Washington, D.C. area.<BR> <BR>Question 18 reserved<BR><BR>Question 19: If two small businesses team with another company or companies, and if <BR>both small business qualify under the specified NAICS code, will the Government accept <BR>a bid where the two small businesses combine for at least 50% of the work with neither <BR>executing at least 50% on their own?<BR>Answer 19:  A prime small business contractor must perform 51% of the work.<BR><BR>Question 20: Proposal Submission Instructions, Section K, Representations and Certifications:  Please provide a copy of the applicable Representations and Certifications that the Government is requiring to be completed and submitted at proposal submission.  <BR>Answer 29:  Please use https://orca.bpn.gov/ to provide your reps and certs for this procurement.<BR><BR>Question 21:  Please clarify whether or not additional Sections apply to this solicitation such as but not limited to:<BR>        Section G  Contract Administration Data<BR>        Section H - Special Contract Requirements<BR>        Section I - Contract Clauses <BR>        Security Requirements <BR>Answer 21:  The resultant contract will be issued under an SF1449 under FAR Part 12. <BR> <BR><BR>Question 22: Can we include a Corporate Overview and Teaming Structure in an Executive Summary?<BR>Answer 22: Yes.<BR><BR>Question 23: What is the intended start date of the contract?<BR>Answer 23: As soon as possible after contract award.<BR><BR>Question 24: Can the Government disclose a list of companies that responded to the EFD<BR>RFI, and which companies/vendors were invited to demonstrate their solutions to the <BR>Government prior to this solicitation?<BR>Answer 24: No.  And nobody was invited to demonstrated their solution. <BR><BR>Question 25: Scenario Overview:<BR>"	Page 6  Demonstration Pre-requisites, 2nd bullet states specific user accounts to set up in the system, however, it is not detailed in the scripts which user account to use for which transaction, and what type of security/access the user should be granted.

Are the licenses requested in the option years above and beyond the ones requested in the base year, and the preceding option periods? The licenses provided for the base year are perpetual licenses meaning that once BTA licenses them,<BR>they would not need to relicense them for option years. In other words, if BTA licenses 50 users of software in the base period and only needs 50 users throughout the project, they would not need to license anything else during the option periods. However, if they<BR>wanted to license an additional 50 users during each period, then that software would need to be licensed.<BR>Answer 54: Additional user licenses may be required as the system is implemented throughout DoD.<BR><BR>Question 55: Document states The period of performance consists of a base<BR>period of 90 days to provide for a baseline product with two software license releases. Please explain what is meant by two software releases, and what impact that has on software licensing. Are these releases of the software to physical locations, or two releases based on phased deployment? How is this reflected in the pricing worksheet?<BR>Answer 55: Software releases refer to an initial baseline capability and an enhanced capabilities release to follow.<BR><BR>Question 56: What constitutes a demonstration failure?<BR>Answer 56:   BSDs are used to assess the quality of the COTS product.<BR><BR>Question 57: The demonstration scripts appear to be incomplete. Please provide us complete set of demonstration scripts?<BR>Answer 57: Sufficient GFI will be provided after technical adequacy is deemed.<BR><BR>Question 58: How many total users are anticipated by the Government across all phases?<BR>Answer 58: Several hundreds of users are anticipated.<BR><BR>Question 59: Are there an anticipated number of users for each phase?<BR>Answer 59: Approximately 100 in Phase I; several hundred in Phase II.<BR><BR>Question 60: Is Section 508 compliance a mandatory requirement, or will a waiver for non-availability be permitted?<BR>Answer 60:   Requirement.<BR><BR>Question 61: What is the estimated throughput, in number of documents, during peak processing?<BR>Answer 61: Estimated at 200 concurrent users during peak usage.<BR><BR>Question 62: Will the Government provide server hardware for the solution, or is the offeror required to deliver the required hardware?<BR>Answer 62: Hardware is government furnished.<BR><BR>Question 63: The demonstration script indicates on page 6, in the Demonstration pre-requisites, that the funds management solution is installed but not configured.  Can you please elaborate on your expectations? Scenario 1 starts with transaction processing. This would require configuration of master data, business rules, etc.<BR>Answer 63: Sufficient GFI will be provided to configure system.<BR><BR>Question 64: With regard to the Functional Requirements Matrix, can you please confirm how the Government wishes the offeror to complete?<BR>Answer 64: The Offeror must complete the Functional Requirements Checklist (Attachment 2) indicating which of the requirements are configurable items, custom changes or not part of the solution.  <BR><BR>Question 65: With regard to the minimum requirement (100% Mandatory and 90% Priority requirements) for technical acceptability, is a requirement that can be met with customization considered to count toward the minimum threshold or against?<BR>Answer 65: Customization would be considered to count toward the minimum<BR>threshold?  <BR><BR><BR><BR>

(NAACCR), Springfield, Illinois 62704, RFP No. N02-PC-85016-78, for a Cost-type contract for five years to improve standards and technical aspects related to the collection, analysis and use of cancer incidence data from a variety of population-based registries.  The resulting standard processes and procedures developed under this contract will improve the national capability for collecting, analyzing, and measuring data comparability from multiple population-based cancer registries and their reporting  sources, including socio-demographic data elements; advance and codify best practices for consolidating data per cancer case; provide empirical and analytical evidence for assessment of more refined criteria for measuring completeness; provide new resources for conducting distributed technical training; improve the efficiency of collecting and reporting cancer data on patients seen in multiple facilities; and initiate further development of more standard and efficient approaches to population-based central registry operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; The NAACCR is a unique organization that would provide knowledge,&nbsp;an interested membership, and access to data to enhance NCI's cancer surveillance program.  Due to the unique role of the NAACCR and support by the public and private sector and their sponsoring member organizations (American Cancer Society, American College of Surgeons, American Joint Committee on Cancer, Canadian Association of Provincial Cancer Agencies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Canada, National Cancer Institute, National Cancer Registrars Association, and Statistics Canada), the NAACCR provides a forum to access and impact its members who are interested in the development and application of population-based cancer registries and morbidity survey techniques as well as studies of defined population groups and the conduct of cancer control programs.  Based on NAACCR's role and accomplishments, combined with its unique membership and support from the public and private sector, no other organization could perform the work envisioned.&nbsp; No collect calls will be accepted.</p>
<p>The objectives of this project are in three specific areas:   1) Strengthen the national capacity for collecting, analyzing, and using comparable cancer registry data for cancer surveillance and research; 2) Develop and improve methods for assessing the quality and comparability of cancer registry data.  This includes, but is not limited to timeliness, completeness, and accuracy; 3) Improve the efficiency and quality of registry operations through promoting established standards, disseminating technical information, and facilitating collaboration among Federal, state, provincial and local registry professionals.</p>
<p>The offeror must demonstrate an understanding of national cancer surveillance efforts, in conjunction with possessing the infrastructure and capacity to promote established standards for cancer registration and must demonstrate the ability to train and educate cancer registry professionals in cancer registry operations; certify registries that achieve standards of high quality; aggregate data from population-based registries throughout the U.S. and Canada;  and promote the use of cancer registry data in surveillance, cancer control, and population-based research.  In addition, the offeror should demonstrate through experience, a track record and ability to receive data from population-based cancer registries throughout North America and have documented endorsement from sponsoring organizations including the American Cancer Society, American College of Surgeons, American Joint Committee on Cancer; Canadian Association of Provincial Cancer Agencies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries; College of American Pathologists, National Cancer Registrars Association, and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Major Tasks include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Committee Support - establish and maintain a network of standing, ad hoc and other special committees which support the development and promotion of uniform data standards for cancer registration; education and training; certification of population-based registries; aggregation and publishing of data from central cancer registries; and promotion of the use of cancer surveillance data and systems for cancer control and epidemiologic research, public health programs, and patient care to reduce the burden of cancer in North America;</p>
<p>&bull; Workshop Support - organize, manage, and assure effective and cost-contained conduct of workshops on technical topics and issues identified through the committee and workgroup structure, for example, workshops on statistical methods and approaches for cancer surveillance, registry operations, training/education needs, leadership, and interoperability issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Special Studies and Reports - Committee and workgroup activities may lead to special requests for additional investigations which require resources.  The offeror may also be required to actively participate in collaborative efforts that use high quality population-based cancer registry data and prepare technical and scientific reports (e.g. the Annual Report to the Nation).  Areas of focus include, but are not limited to, Data Use and Quality, Research Metrics and Methods, and Social and economic determinants of disease;</p>
<p>&bull; Registry Operations - provide support for the development, implementation, and dissemination of technical procedures, guidelines and standards in cancer registry operations that advance the field toward more consistent, efficient, and effective performance.  The offeror shall coordinate a series of strategic activities designed to develop, codify, and promote guidelines pertinent to effective and efficient operations of population-based cancer registries.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
