<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for <strong>the standardization of Pregnancy Test Kits on or about September 2012,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection.

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc has a requirement for 1 EACH NBOX DISPLAY PRC Arcata Associates, Inc. intends to purchase the items from 3D PERCEPTION, INC. 12600 CHALLENGER PARK WAY SUITE 155 ORLANDO, FL 32807. The existing blender is part of an existing system, which includes three separate custom image generators (IGs), three separate projectors, and a custom screen.  The projectors and blender are from the same manufacturer, and are designed to work together to accomplish their task.	The existing blender has been discontinued, and the proposed replacement blender is the manufacturer's recommended replacement blender for this system.  Since the blender unit is failing a replacement part has been recommended by the OEM that is completely compatible to repair the existing system, we therefore recommend sole source procurement for this component. To develop a new source and test another manufactures product for compatibility with the other mating units would not be in the best interest of the government. It would cost considerable more in man power, testing and acquisitioning than what this acquisition is estimated to cost. Therefore, it would only cause an undue delay in getting this project completed. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on June 29, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) intends to release a Program Element Appendix (PEA) of the Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2), with a target date of June 28, 2012. This PEA will solicit proposals for instrument investigations to be implemented through the European Space Agencys (ESA) JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. NASA has allocated $100 Million RY budget over the full life cycle of the mission for a limited portion of the JUICE payload. The NASA contribution would consist of a combination of 1) U.S.-led instrument(s), 2) U.S.-provided instrument component(s) for European-led instrument(s), and/or 3) U.S. Co-Investigators on European-led instruments, all to total not more than $100M life cycle cost.  Only proposals for the first type of contribution (i.e., U.S. PI-led instrument investigations) should be submitted to this PEA.  Proposals with the latter two types of U.S. contributions (i.e., proposals led by a non-U.S. PI) should respond to the ESA AO released in conjunction with this PEA. Participation in this PEA will be open to all categories of organizations (foreign and domestic, with the exception that European Principle Investigators must submit their proposals to a separate Announcement of Opportunity to be released by ESA), including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC's), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and other Government agencies.  Principal Investigators are responsible for and allowed to assemble the instrument team from any and all of these organizations. The JUpiter ICy moons Explorer PEA solicits flight investigations for which the Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for a complete space flight investigation including instrument hardware, all mission operations, and data analysis. The target launch date for the JUICE mission is June 2022. The mission is described in detail in the ESA Science Management Plan and the ESA Yellow Book, which will become available at http://sci.esa.int/juice	and will be linked from the JUICE Acquisition Library when the PEA is released. The scientific objectives of the JUICE mission are: 1) Study Ganymede as a planetary object, including its potential habitability; 2) Explore Europas recently active zones; 3) Study Callisto as a remnant of the early Jovian System; 4) Explore the Jupiter System as an archetype for gas giants ESA has defined a model payload of eleven instruments that could achieve the scientific objectives. The list of candidate instrument types is not intended to restrict the possible approaches, nor is the list intended to preclude consideration of investigations that propose other instruments or combinations of instruments that can provide the necessary observations. The model payload includes: 1)  Narrow Angle Camera 2)  Wide Angle Camera 3)  Visible and Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometer 4)  Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer 5)  Sub-millimeter Wave Instrument 6)  Laser Altimeter 7)  Ice Penetrating Radar 8)  Magnetometer 9)  Particle Package 10) Radio and Plasma Wave instrument 11) Radio Science Instrument and Ultra-stable Oscillator The total payload resources including mass, power, and data for the instrument complement will be described in a document in the JUICE Acquisition Library. This expanded version of the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) notice will be available until the date of release of the AO.	Note that the JUICE PEA may contain provisions that differ from this notice, in which case those in the PEA will take precedence.  Questions or comments about this intention to release a JUICE PEA may be addressed to the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter Scientist: Dr. Curt Niebur, Science Mission Directorate (SMD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001; E-mail: curt.niebur@nasa.gov; the character string JUICE PEA (without quotes) should be included in the subject line of all transmissions.  Telephone: (202) 358-0390. Important characteristics of this intended PEA are expected to be: NASA has allocated $100 Million RY budget over the full life cycle of the mission for a limited portion of the JUICE payload consisting of the three types of contributions described above. Pending the submission of an adequate number of proposals of merit, NASA expects to select programmatically balanced U.S. contributions of the three types described above, including approximately two instruments that address the JUICE science objectives.  Proposals submitted in response to this intended PEA will undergo standard NASA evaluation by two independent panels: one to evaluate science merit and feasibility of the science investigation and one to evaluate feasibility of the implementation approach, including cost (Technical, Management, and Cost Review Panel).	NASA will also evaluate U.S. contributions contained in any proposal submitted in response to the ESA AO.  NASA will share these review results with the ESA Proposal Review Committee for their consideration. All proposals submitted in response to this PEA will be provided by NASA to ESA and undergo the ESA review process described in the ESA Science Management Plan.  All ESA reviewers will sign a nondisclosure agreement.	 Proposers responding to this PEA must indicate any ITAR sensitive material in their proposals.   ESA will share with NASA the results of its review for proposals containing NASA contributions.	However, NASA retains selection authority for U.S. contributions.  NASA welcomes contributions from non-U.S. institutions on proposals with a U.S. PI provided that they are offered on a no-exchange-of-funds basis, comply with current U.S. restrictions concerning the export of technology, and do not exceed one-third (1/3) of the proposed PI-Managed Mission Cost. Data from JUICE investigations must be made fully public through the Planetary Data System (PDS) in a usable form, as soon as practical but no more than six months after acquisition. All data products shall be documented, validated, and calibrated in physical units usable by the scientific community at large. All proposals will be required to include in their overall planning both funding and commitment to NASAs Education and Public Outreach (EPO), and Small Disadvantaged Business Programs (details of these plans will be required in Phase A/B if selected). The following schedule describes the anticipated major milestones of the JUICE PEA. These dates may change. PEA Release approximately - June 28, 2012 Preproposal Conference - Release + ~3 wks Notice of Intent to Propose due - August 2, 2012 Proposals due - September 20, 2012; 11:59 PM Eastern Non-U.S. Letters of Endorsement - Due with proposals Selection announced (target) - January 2013

<SUBJECT>Proposer's Day Notice for the IARPA HFGeo Program
<SOLNBR>IARPA-BAA-12-04
<ARCHDATE>06152013
<CONTACT>Dr. Frank Robey, Email dni-iarpa-baa-12-04@ugov.gov
<DESC>Synopsis: <br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day for the HFGeo Program on July 13, 2012, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation for the development of ionospheric characterization technology in support of the High Frequency Geolocation and characterization (HFGeo) program. The event will be held from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The purpose of the Proposers' Day will be to provide information on the HFGeo program and its ionosphere characterization goals, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and find potential team partners. This potential effort is envisioned to complement other HFGeo research on novel antenna design and signal processing algorithms already ongoing (see IARPA-BAA-11-07). Participation in the ionospheric characterization area is independent of the other ongoing HFGeo activities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />The overall HFGeo Program seeks to dramatically improve the ability to geolocate and characterize High Frequency (HF) emitters. The initial technology development in this program is expected to: 1) accurately resolve multiple angles-of-arrival and polarization states through novel antenna concepts; 2) enhance signal-to-noise ratio and signal detection through the use of multi-dimensional adaptive signal processing, and; 3) accurately determine the state of the dynamic ionosphere. A prior solicitation, IARPA-BAA-11-07, covered the first two components of the HFGeo program (novel antenna concepts and signal processing algorithms). This Proposers' Day will address the third topic area of ionospheric modeling.</p>
<p>The earth's ionosphere is driven by dynamic atmospheric and space weather conditions that can dramatically change how ionospherically-dependent communications or radar systems operate. Variations in solar flux including x-ray flares, energetic particle events, coronal mass ejections, and variations in solar wind properties influence the ionospheric conditions in a profound manner. Significant large-scale enhancements or diminutions in the free electron concentration can arise over a period of minutes to hours. Tidal forces and normal diurnal effects combine with these variations in solar flux to induce a hierarchy of ionospheric fluctuations from small-scale ionospheric turbulence to traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). The fluctuations can be associated with source regions that are either local or remote and induce significant changes to the propagation of radio waves, in particular, HF radio waves that are refracted from the lower portions of the ionosphere. Ionospheric variability is one of the key sources of uncertainty regarding the propagation of radio waves from one location to another.</p>
<p>Many of the recent efforts in ionospheric measurement and modeling have been focused on global models that assimilate many measurement sources to accurately model the path between the ground and space. While this assists in more precise GPS navigation and other applications, the resulting models do not always capture the regional dynamics and the varying electron density distribution below the F-layer peak to sufficiently determine HF skywave signal propagation paths.</p>
<p>The goal of this effort is to consolidate multiple sources to produce a model that will accurately characterize the multiple propagation paths found in HF skywave radio wave propagation. This necessitates a focus on the bottom side of the ionosphere, and the model must incorporate the propagation physics associated with the D, E, F1, F2 layers, the earth's geomagnetic field and one or more hop propagation.</p>
<p>Coupled with the novel antenna and signal processing approaches already underway, this ionospheric measurement and modeling technology will provide greatly improved HF geolocation capabilities. If successful, later phases of HFGeo will integrate and rigorously test these technologies with the goal of accurately geolocating and characterizing HF emitters.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern July 6, 2012 at http://events.signup4.com/HFGeoPD_Registration. Directions to the facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than two representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the facility. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this event.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />Proposers' Day Announcement for the Knowledge Representation in Neural Systems (KRNS)Program<br />Solicitation Number: IARPA-BAA-12-05<br />Agency: Office of the Director of National Intelligence<br />Office: Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day for the Knowledge Representation in Neural Systems (KRNS) Program on July 12, 2012, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Proposers' Day will be held from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the event will be to provide information on KRNS, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and find potential team partners. This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />When making sense of intelligence data, analysts rely on rich repertoires of conceptual knowledge to resolve ambiguities, make inferences, and draw conclusions. Conceptual knowledge refers to knowledge about the general properties of an entity (e.g., an apple is edible) as well as its relationships to other entities (e.g., an apple is associated with orchards, grocery stores, etc.). Understanding how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge is a step toward building new analysis tools that acquire, organize and wield knowledge with unprecedented proficiency. Moreover, such understanding may lead to the development of novel techniques for training intelligence analysts and linguists.<br /><br />The goal of the KRNS Program is to develop and rigorously evaluate theories that explain how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge. In part the evaluation will rest on how well concepts can be interpreted from neural activity patterns using algorithms derived from the theories. In addition to new theories and algorithms, KRNS seeks the development of innovative protocols for evoking and measuring concept-related neural activity using neural imaging methods such as (but not limited to) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p>
<p>Whereas previous research has examined the neural representations of single concepts in isolation, the KRNS Program seeks to greatly expand our understanding of how the brain represents combinations of concepts (e.g., how the neural representation of "the student was bored with the book" differs from the neural representations of the individual concepts "student," "bored," and "book"). A wide range of concept types is of interest in KRNS, from the concrete to the abstract, including: animate and inanimate objects; actions; physical and temporal settings; events; social roles; social interactions; emotions; properties; conditions.</p>
<p>Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary, including personnel with expertise in areas such as neuroscience, cognitive science, machine learning and linguistics. IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this research. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in peer-reviewed academic journals.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00 pm ET, July 5, 2012, at the following website: https://www.signup4.net/Public/ap.aspx?EID=KRNS11E. Directions to the facility and other materials are available on the website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed. Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than two representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the facility. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation &amp; Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the event has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 12 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Physical Measurement Laboratory- Dimensional Metrology Group, intends to negotiate with FARO Technologies, Inc.; Lake Mary, FL, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to purchase an ION laser tracker system.
<p>The Advance Dimensional Measuring Systems project team develops test methods, procedures and documentary standards that evaluate the performance of measuring systems used in advance manufacturing. A unique and required feature offered by FARO Technologies is its "Instant-On Laser" that enables immediate absolute distance measurement capability. This feature, along with a greater than 9.5 kHz absolute distance meter sampling rate, enables higher throughput for measurements of long length standards such as fiber optic cals. This capability will also satisfy ASME B89.4.19 and ISO 10360-10 measurement standards, which NIST will test. Recent market research conducted by NIST shows that both of these required features are not available from other laser tracker manufacturers. FARO Technologies, Inc. is the sole provider of this product.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334513- Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables with a Size Standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to FARO Technologies, Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), has been charged to lead the nation in utilizing existing and emerging information technology (IT) to meet national priorities that reflect the country's broad based social, economic, and political values and goals. Its extended charge continues under the Federal Information Security Management Act to develop cyber security standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques.
<p>Revised OMB Circular A-119 establishes policies on Federal use and development of voluntary consensus standards and on conformity assessment activities. Public Law 104-113, the "National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995," codified existing policies in A-119, established reporting requirements, and authorized NIST to coordinate conformity assessment activities of the agencies.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the U. S. Government has a source of technically sound, consensus international biometric standards to meet the Government's priority needs for biometric-based recognition of individuals, NIST championed the formation of International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 1/Subcommittee (SC) 37, Biometrics ("JTC1/SC 37"). NIST determined the best method for ensuring first-rate secretariat services for JTC 1/SC 37 was to contract for such services. These JTC 1/SC 37 secretariat services are for the direct benefit of NIST and the USG ensuring the rapid development of critically needed voluntary consensus biometric standards developed in an environment that offers openness and due process as required by OMB Circular A-119.</p>
<p>By providing these services, NIST/ITL supports the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy/National Science and Technology Council's goals as delineated under its Policy for Enabling the Development, Adoption and Use of Biometric Standards, which is to enable biometric system interoperability and support Federal agency biometrics needs. This policy states that "Continued development of voluntary consensus standards for biometrics is vital to the security of our Nation and the stability of the US-based biometrics community"</p>
<p>Work under this procurement will acquire Secretariat services for the International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission, Joint Technical Committee 1 on Information Technology, Subcommittee 37 on Biometrics (JTC 1/SC37) and JTC 1/SC 37 Working Group 4 on Biometric Functional Architecture and Related Profiles (JTC 1/SC37 WG 4). NIST requires these services to further its objective of ensuring timely development and approval of International Standards in support of National and Homeland Security requirements for the United States.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be one year with four one year option periods. <br /><br />This procurement shall be competed using negotiated procedures under the authority of FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation using full and open competition. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a small business size standard $14.0M.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), specifications, RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-12-RP-0060.</p>
<p>The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community approximately 15 days after release of this notice and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site. Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.</p>

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is conducting a nested case-control study of cancer among a cohort of adult liver transplant recipients followed at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. Cases will be recipients who developed non-melanoma skin cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, or colorectal cancer. Cancer-free controls will be selected in a 3:1 ratio from the same cohort. NCI investigators will measure serum levels of TGF-beta1 and VEGF using samples obtained at least 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis in cases and samples from controls. <br /><br />The Baylor University Medical Center is the only custodian of the liver recipient cohort data that IIB requires for their study. Therefore only Baylor Research Institute can perform these services.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.<br /><br />13C based MRI, unlike 1H based MRI (conventional MRI) has 4-5 orders in magnitude lower sensitivity. The ability of 13C MRI in distinguishing various endogenous molecules and metabolic products is much higher than 1H MRI because of the chemical shift differences in their spectra. It is now possible to gain the desired sensitivity using the technique of hyperpolarization which has launched a new branch of MRI called metabolic MRI.<br /><br />The purpose is to obtain a polarizer which can prepare clinical grade 13C labeled tracers such as pyruvate which have the 13C nuclear spin states polarized 4-5 orders in magnitude higher than at equilibrium conditions using a paramagnetic material which is co-frozen with the tracer and dissolved in buffer to conduct human clinical trials. The polarization should take place at temperatures ~1 K to realize the desired extent of polarization. A key requirement is that after 30 minutes for polarization, the material should be dissolved in the dissolution buffer, the paramagnetic material extracted, and the injectate checked for temperature and pH prior to injection into a human subject. The polarizer should be placed in very close proximity to a clinical MRI scanner. The polarizer should be able to achieve &gt;20% polarization of the nuclear spin states of 13C nucleus in endogenous molecules such as pyruvate, fumarate, succinate enriched with 13C. The chemical shift dispersion of 13C which is significantly higher than 1H nucleus will enable to monitor the distribution of the injected tracer and also the breakdown products of the tracer into various metabolites based on 13C chemical shift MRI. This will confer the ability to profile tissues metabolically. Since malignancies and premalignant tissue display metabolic differences, the use of hyperpolarized tracers will confer the ability to non-invasively and serially monitor high-risk groups of people as surveillance for early detection of cancer and intervention.<br /><br />Salient Characteristics of the GE Diamond SpinLab DNP include: (1) A superconducting magnet at 3.5 T, (2) a W-band (95 GHz) EPR irradiation cavity, (3) a cryopump to cool the sample to below 1 K, (4) a helium recovery line to minimize the helium burn off, (5) a system to monitor polarization build up, (6) a quality control module to check pH and temperature before injection, and (7) a sterile fluid path for the injectate to ensure that it is pyrogen free.<br /><br />The Diamond SpinLab DNP is the only known polarizer suitable for clinical use since it utilizes a proprietary dissolution technology which can take a polarized tracer in a pellet at 1K temperature and dissolve it with the buffer solution to bring it to room temperature (300 K) and physiological pH in under 10 seconds after quality control check for pH and removal of EPA. General Electric Company is the manufacturer and only known distributor of the GE Diamond SpinLab DNP and therefore the sole known source.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.

<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard in $14.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for ten months with one twelve month option period.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP; http://ncccp.cancer.gov/ ) to accelerate the delivery of cancer care and research in community-based locations, and enable the provision of state-of-the-art, multi-specialty care and early phase clinical trials. The program is designed to improve the reach to 80-85% of cancer patients across the country who do not have access to NCI-designated Cancer Centers.</p>
<p>The NCI Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP; http://dcp.cancer.gov/programs-resources/programs/ccop ) is a network for testing and validating medical interventions against cancer, and for delivering the benefits of scientific discovery to the public and community physicians. The network increases involvement of oncologists and other health professionals in NCI-approved clinical trials as full research partners; improves the quality of cancer care in local communities by disseminating research findings; and boosts participation of minority and underserved populations in cancer clinical trials.</p>
<p>NCI is combining its community-based research networks to create a single network that builds on their strengths. The Community Clinical Oncology Program Network, including Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs), Minority-based Community Clinical Oncology Programs (MB-CCOPs) and Research Bases, and the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) will be united to create the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (N-CORP).</p>
<p>It is estimated that the N-CORP program will begin in 2014, and the NCCCP and CCOP programs will continue until that time. Until that time, the contractor shall work as a member of the NCCCP Program Advisory Committee (NPAC), a group composed of experts in community-based research and delivery of care, to oversee the implementation of activities to meet the goals of the current NCCCP program. The contractor shall also work as a member of the NCCCP Evaluation Oversight Committee (EOC), monitoring the ongoing evaluation of the current NCCCP program that studies the interactions of the NCCCP program sites with NCI-designated Cancer Centers.</p>
<p>An N-CORP Working Group has been established at the NCI to develop the N-CORP program. As a member of the N-CORP Working Group, the contractor shall provide recommendations on the conceptualization and development of the N-CORP based on the current CCOP and NCCCP program goals (see websites).</p>
<p>The contractor shall have the following background in order to be qualified to successfully carry out the requirements of this requirement:</p>
<p>&bull; Public Health Policy background.</p>
<p>&bull; Leadership experience in previous evaluation processes of community cancer care. This must include academic credentials and demonstrated publications of evaluation of community cancer care that reach those with healthcare disparities. This is due to the need for the evaluation strategies to be based on current academic practices, including a theory-driven process and outcome evaluation to assess the implementation of the overall N-CORP program and its components.</p>
<p>&bull; Research experience in organizational factors affecting program implementation change in a variety of healthcare organizations.</p>
<p>&bull; Experience with continuous quality improvement initiatives in both organizational and primary-care settings.</p>
<p>&bull; Experience the study of alliances within healthcare.</p>
<p>The NCI proposes to enter into a sole source purchase order with Dr. Arnold Kaluzny for the reasons below:</p>
<p>&bull; To work as a member of the NCCCP Program Advisory Committee (NPAC), a group primarily composed of government staff who are experts in community-based research and delivery of care, to oversee the implementation of activities to meet the goals of the current NCCCP program, through recommendations at the monthly NPAC meetings when updates are provided related to the subcommittees of the program, particularly the Executive Subcommittee and the Quality of Care Subcommittee.<br />&bull; To work as a member of the NCCCP Evaluation Oversight Committee (EOC), monitoring the ongoing evaluation of the current NCCCP program that studies the interactions of the NCCCP program with NCI-designated Cancer Centers. <br />&bull; To work as a member of the N-CORP Working Group, composed of government employees and select contractors, to develop the N-CORP program. As a member of the N-CORP Working Group, Dr. Kaluzny will provide recommendations on the conceptualization and development of the N-CORP based on the current CCOP and NCCCP program goals.</p>
<p>Membership on the NCCCP NPAC and EOC and on the N-CORP Working Group requires a deep understanding of the NCI NCCCP and CCOP programs, and expertise in public health policy, academic-based evaluation of community cancer care, and research experience in organizational factors, quality improvement initiatives and alliances within the healthcare setting.

<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute (SB/NCI) has an ongoing clinical program using adoptive cell transfer therapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer. The cell production laboratory of the SB/NCI uses a number of techniques to identify, purify and expand tumor reactive T lymphocytes from patients with advanced cancer. For adoptive transfer protocols only equipment and reagents that are produced in accordance with good manufacturing practices (GMP) can be utilized to expand patient cells, as mandated by the FDA.</p>
<p>The Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute (SB/NCI) requires a series of gas permeable flasks to successfully expand patient cells for adoptive cell therapy. These flasks are critical for the successful expansion of patient cells, to high densities, under static conditions, while providing enhanced aeration. Static culture conditions are essential for the early stages of lymphocyte expansions, where uninterrupted contact with feeder cells is necessary to provide the essential co-stimulatory signals to initiate a successful patient treatment. The NCI plans to use these gas permeable flasks to expand patient cells for the following clinical protocols and all subsequent protocols (08-C-0181; 10-C-0166; 11-C-0123; 11-C-0163; 11-C-0170; 11-C-0260; 12-C-0045; 12-C-0114; and 12-C-0116). These protocols require the rapid expansion of patients' cells in as small a volume of media as possible in order to facilitate harvesting and washing of the cell product. The required flasks shall be gamma irradiated, single unit gas-culture-permeable devices with a 100 cm2 culture area, a 500 ml medium capacity, and capable of holding 1 billion cells. The required flask size is 4.5" diameter by 4" high as required by the SB/NCI incubator.</p>
<p>Wilson Wolf Manufacturing is the sole known supplier of G-Rex100 Gas Permeable Cell Culture Devices. No other known product is available that is able to support T lymphocyte rapid expansions from initiation to conclusion in dense static culture conditions. As the product is proprietary, Wilson Wolf Manufacturing is the only known source.</p>

<SUBJECT>R--Management and Sustainment of the Data Mining and Risk Assessment Applications for the Purchase Card Online System
<SOLNBR>N0018912RZ087
<CONTACT>Claryce Holt-Bond 2156979684
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS) Program support with System Integrator (SI) services for the management and complete sustainment of the Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA) applications. Or, an alternative Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) application that meets the baseline specifications in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) while bringing together the component subsystems functions seamlessly.  The base period of performance for this acquisition is anticipated to begin on 01 July 2013 and continue through 30 June 2018.  The proposed contract will contain four (4) option periods as such,  Base 01 July 2013 â€“ 30 June 2014 Option 1 01 July 2014 â€“ 30 June 2015 Option 2 01 July 2015 â€“ 30 June 2016  Option 3 01 July 2016 â€“ 30 June 2017 Option 4 01 July 2017 â€“ 30 June 2018.
  In 2007, the Department of Defense (DOD) Purchase Card Policy Office (PCPO) Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) procured a Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM RA) capability to 1. Identify and report fraudulent and abusive spending and theft and misuse of government property associated with its purchase/payment cards. 2. Report on the overall health of DOD Purchase Card programs at various levels in the reporting hierarchy. The over-arching objective of this contract is the acquisition of Information Technology professional services to perform comprehensive Systems Integration and Data Management responsibilities. The successful offeror shall work with the Government to enable cross-functional DOD groups to define, deploy, and implement Purchase Card application logic across the DOD Purchase Card Online System-of-Systems.
 This includes managing and integrating the baseline applications and data sets, evaluating alternatives to the baseline, management of workflows, software development, and the development of a new data management strategy to engender efficiency and increased effectiveness in the PCOLS Program within the Procure-to-Pay ecosystem of systems in the DOD. The adaptation of any new technology within the integrated environment must meet tests of 1) commercial off-the-shelf deploy-ability with little customization 2) affordability and 3) audit readiness IAW with the DoD Financial Management guidelines. Proposed changes to the deployed baseline architecture shall be evaluated as-to their impact on training, hardware, regulatory restrictions, information assurance per DODINST 8520 (series), and other externalities that would impose costs on the total cost of ownership relative to a change-out of the baseline application suite.
 The functional business objective is to Mine Data from Purchase Card transactions via the deployment of a data-screening application that uses a combination of discreet DOD-tailored business rules to detect card misuse and a neural learning capability that enables the identification of transactions at the most risk of being fraudulent or abusive. The transactions mined will be screened, scored, and when appropriate, referred to card managers for review and archived.  Also, the system is to learn from past transactions to build a knowledge base that improves scoring accuracy over time.  On a monthly basis, it provides a report card, based on transaction through-put from numerous financial institutions, which identifies and stratifies at-risk transactions, based-on the internal business rules established to ensure robust internal control of card use.
 This objective also includes the delivery of configurable web-delivered reporting within the confines of DOD Information Assurance regulations, including Common Access Card (CAC) enabled single-sign-on for users. These services shall be procured, through a competitive acquisition. The NAICS code is 541511 and the size standard is 25 million. The type of contract anticipated is a firm-fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, non-personal services contract. The policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, will be used. The full solicitation and all amendments will only be available at the NECO website.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency.
  The Request for Proposal may require the submission of price, technical, and/or past performance information.

<SUBJECT>66--Notice of Intent to Award to Scintrex Ltd for a CG-5 digital gravity meter
<SOLNBR>G12PS00534
<RESPDATE>062912
<ARCHDATE>07292012
<CONTACT>Zachary Buss

<a href="mailto:zbuss@usgs.gov">zbuss@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Scintrex Limited under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)), Simplified Acquisition Procedures, for a CG-5 digital gravity meter.
The USGS requires the purchase of this unit to support research efforts in all teams that the Geophysics Unit of Menlo Park (GUMP) is involved with (GMEG, Volcano Hazards, and Earthquake Hazards Teams, as well as projects funded by numerous reimbursable projects).   The purchase of this new equipment will improve our ability to make precise and accurate measurements and serves to phase out old equipment that is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.
In 2006 and 2011, GUMP purchased a CG-5 digital gravity meter manufactured by Scintrex Limited. We have since used the CG-5 meters under a variety of field conditions, including an extensive calibration loop designed to test the meter's performance across a wide range of gravity values.  It performed well and met all of our specifications for field operations.  This product is, to the best of our knowledge, the only digital (or analog) instrument on the market that meets our needs for high precision, portability, and durability to replace our aging analog meters.  
Scintrex Limited is the only known source that can provide the required equipment that has all of the following unique capabilities: -	A high precision (microgal level), ultra-portable, relative gravity meter, that is fast and easy to operate.  This is essential to our work which demands us to: collect high-quality, high precision data, acquire data in difficult-to-access areas requiring hiking with our meters and hauling them across rugged-terrain, and amass large amounts of data in a short amount of time. -	Extremely linear drift and no screw mechanism.  This reduces error associated with irregular drift allowing us to maintain high-precision while performing long periods between base station measurements, and removes errors associated with 'play' in screw-mechanisms. -	Automatic seismic filter and tilt correction capabilities.  This significantly reduces error during times of large earthquakes (that may otherwise disrupt measurements for hours at a time), at sites susceptible to wind or wind-related (e.g. trees swaying in the wind) vibrations, and sites where ground is less stable where drift in the tilt is a problem. -	The ability to perform automatic tide corrections.  This is a great advantage for correcting in real-time the tide corrections and facilitates monitoring drift between base station measurements and monitoring station-to-station changes. -	An 'unlimited' range (>100's mGal).  This is extremely important for most of our work which exceed this limit and prevents us from having to reset the range during a single field session.  This saves us time and reduces errors associated with the resetting the range.
Finally, the Scintrex meters are considered to be rugged (e.g., no-beam-clamp vs. beam-clamp), which is important for us, since our field applications are performed in extremely rugged conditions using unconventional modes of transportation (helicopter,  ATVs, snow mobiles, and boats) that can impart high-amplitude vibrations and jolts to the meter.
Furthermore, it would be a significant impact to our team to have to deal with a new and entirely different type of meter that would require different calibration, field use, and processing procedures. Mixing and matching other meters and CG-5 meters would degrade our data quality, and impact our research because we specialize in studies requiring high-resolution data. 
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USGS' requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency (FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i)). All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Zachary Buss, at zbuss@usgs.gov. This notice conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-58, Effective 18 May 2012. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334513- Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees

<DESC>The Coast Guard is continuing to conduct market research for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) acquisition.
<p>The Coast Guard intends to release the draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for Industry review and comment on or about June 15, 2012. <br />The Coast Guard plans to release the following draft RFP attachments: External Reference List, General Use Consumable List, Medical Allowance List, Allowance Equipage List, Schedule B and to re-release Schedule A, and Schedule C. <br />Also, for background purposes, the Coast Guard is making the OPC Concept of Operations (CONOPS) available on the website. CONOPS describes a proposed asset or system in terms of the user needs it will fulfill, its relationship to existing Coast Guard assets, systems or procedures, and the ways it will be used. The CONOPS is not a requirements document. Where the CONOPS conflicts with the OPC RFP, the requirements of the RFP supersede the CONOPS.<br /><br />The draft RFP (Sections B through M) and other documents will be available on the USCG OPC website at: http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/OPC/default.asp<br />In addition, the Coast Guard intends to release the red-lined draft 400 SWBS sections from the OPC System Specification for Industry review and comment. <br />The red-lined draft 400 SWBS sections contain all of the changes that the Coast Guard incorporated as a result of prior industry comment. This document will be automatically distributed to those companies and individuals that received the draft OPC specification released in March 2012.<br />The draft specification requires the OPC to be classed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) to the ABS Rules for Building and Classing Naval Vessels, January 2010 (a.k.a. the Naval Vessel Rules or NVR). The draft specification invokes NVR as a first tier reference and tailors it through an Addendum. This NVR Tailoring Addendum contains OPC specific tailoring to the Naval Vessel Rules 2010. As such, it is impossible to understand the OPC specification, and complete cutter requirements, without access to NVR. Instructions for requesting access to NVR are available on the OPC website.<br />Your attention is directed to the fact that the NVR contains sensitive information relating to critical technology which must be protected from release to unauthorized non US entities and parties not having a valid need to know. NVR is marked as "Distribution Statement D" and must be maintained in accordance with SECNAVINST 5510.36, DOD Directive 5230.25, OPNAVINST 5510.101 and Title 22 USC Section 2751. Violators of these laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.<br /><br />In addition, NVR is governed by the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which means it contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC Sect 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1970, as amended (Title 50 USC App 2401, et seq.). Violators of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. It must be disseminated per the provisions of OPNAVINST 5510.161.<br />The OPC draft specification and NVR Tailoring Addendum must also be treated with these same sensitivities. Secondary distribution of these documents is limited in accordance with their "Distribution Statement C" markings to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors. <br />Companies or individuals who have not previously registered with the U. S. Coast Guard and are interested in reviewing the draft documentation should send an email to:</p>
<p>offshore.patrol@uscg.mil</p>
<p>requesting your company's draft documentation. Include in your email which specification sections or draft documents you wish to review and the email address you desire the documents delivered. Provide acknowledgement that you are a U. S. citizen representing a U. S. company and provide your DUNS number for validation. Also indicate if your company currently has access to NVR.<br />In order for the Coast Guard to consider responses and comments on the draft documentation, they must be submitted on the form provided and emailed to:</p>
<p>offshore.patrol@uscg.mil<br /><br />In order for your comments to be reviewed and considered for incorporation into the draft Request for Proposals, responses must be received by July 16, 2012. Incremental submission of comments is strongly encouraged. Please make your comments and justification for your comments as comprehensive and complete as possible. <br />The Coast Guard intends to share feedback received with Coast Guard support contractors. Proprietary or business confidential markings that prohibit distribution to Coast Guard support contractors should be included only where warranted. <br /><br />The Coast Guard invites U. S. shipyards to participate in one on one meetings (FAR 15.201(c)(4)). The Coast Guard is interested in meeting with U. S. shipyards that have the organic capability to construct a cutter of the OPC's size and complexity. These meetings will be held in Washington DC and are planned for the week of 9 July. The Coast Guard is interested in hearing any final comments from industry regarding the various draft RFP documents that have been provided for industry review. U. S. shipyards that meet our criteria should indicate their interest and primary contact point by email to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Carl. McGill, at carl.e.mcgill@uscg.mil prior to June 19, 2012. <br /><br />Updates on the OPC acquisition will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunity website.<br /><br />Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. Responses received after the established deadline may not be considered.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Training Center (NTC) located at 9828 North 31st Avenue Phoenix, Arizona 85051 seeks products equal to two specified products. This is for the "or equal" factor in competing brand name or equal. The BLM NTC can not immediately compete brand name or equal because before any software can be considered it must be first based lined by the IT department. Hence, the BLM NTC can not immediately compete brand name or equal because it would not know what to base line. So the "or equal" portion must be conducted first which is what this sources sought is performing. The two products that the BLM NTC seeks "or equal" products to are those listed in the line items section. If you have one or both, please send product literature to contract specialist Pete Smolinski (psmolins@blm.gov). Pete will then collect all such product information and give it to the source selection committe which will determine if the product is "or equal" or is not "or equal".

<CONTACT>Elizabeth B. Downey, Phone 301-443-0332, Fax 301-443-5462, Email bdowney@hrsa.gov
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to conduct economic and trend analyses of the Data Bank's past and current revenue, expenses, and cash reserves. These analyses shall be used to create reusable analytical models which will forecast and/or predict future economic trends as they relate to query fee structure to support a financially self-sustaining program.
<p><br />The purpose of the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) is to improve the quality of health care by requiring State licensing boards, hospitals and other health care entities and professional societies to identify those practitioners who engage in unprofessional behavior, and to restrict the ability of incompetent physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners from moving State to State without disclosure or discovery of previous medical malpractice payment and adverse action history. These adverse actions could pertain to professional licensure, clinical privileges, and professional society memberships.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) is to combat fraud and abuse in the health insurance industry and in health care delivery. HIPDB information is intended to be used in combination with information from other sources in making determinations on employment, affiliation, certification, or licensure decisions. The information in the HIPDB should serve as a flagging system to alert U.S. Government and State agencies and health plans that there may be a problem with the performance of a particular practitioner, provider, or supplier.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to:</p>
<p>1. Develop a detailed methodology and analysis plan in the areas of empirical estimates, expenses, revenue, cash reserves, query fees, and organization growth that will be in line with HRSA's Strategic Goals; <br />2. Indicate the questions the economic analyses and models will address, i.e. the theoretical basis for the analysis, the assumptions proposed for the analysis, the data and estimation procedures proposed to implement the analysis, the expected outputs, the anticipated schedule of the analysis, and a brief description of any alternative analysis approaches; <br />3. Provide the requested information in written hard copy and electronic format to the COR; and,<br />4. Develop analyses and models to support various aspects of forecasting, identifying risks, and opportunities for future growth.</p>
<p>These analyses and models shall include the following:</p>
<p>a) A determination of the DPDB's economic break-even point. <br />b) A cost-benefit analysis that includes both qualitative and quantitative benefits. The analysis shall include estimates of cost savings and avoidance, as well as financial analysis that include Payback Period, Net Present Value and Return on Investment metrics.<br />c) A basis of estimate that thoroughly describes the assumptions, mathematics, and reasoning of the calculations for each alternative.<br />d) A highlighting of areas for improvement and areas that offers future potential.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors (in team or alone) must satisfy the following minimum requirements. Provide a detailed description of your company's experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following requirements:</p>
<p>a) Revenue Model<br />The Data Bank revenue comes directly from Data Bank users who submit and pay for queries. No funds are appropriated for either the NPDB or HIPDB by Congress. All revenues are used for Data Bank program operations. The model must compare historical and forecasted trends of revenue, develop an estimated annual revenue growth rate and show the projected impact of the revenue on the merger between the NPDB and HIPDB.</p>
<p>b) Expense Model<br />The Data Bank annual expenses are approximately $25 million dollars. With the increase in staff over the years, expenses have increased. The model must compare historical and forecasted trends of expenses, develop an estimated annual expense growth rate, and show the projected impact of the expenses on the merger between the NPDB and HIPDB</p>
<p>c) Cash Reserves Model<br />A substantial cash reserve is required to mitigate the possibility of decrease revenues. While NPDB cash reserve may appear to be high, the Data Bank continues to assure that the reserve is maintained at a reasonable but not excessive level. The Data Bank anticipates the reserve balance will remain high until adjustments are made to user fees. The model must compare historical and forecasted trends of cash reserves, develop an estimated annual cash reserves growth rate, and show the projected impact of the expenses on the merger between the NPDB and HIPDB</p>
<p>d) Query Fee Structure Model<br />The Data Bank charges a query fee to recover the costs of operating the Data Bank, (which is required by law to be self-sustaining). Fees are charged for Traditional Queries, Continuous Query Enrollments, and Self Queries. Traditional Queries are requests for information about a specific subject or entity. The Continuous Query is an enrollment service which gives enrolled health care providers notification within one business day of the Data Bank's receipt of a report on any of its enrolled practitioners. The model must compare historical and forecasted trends of query fees, determine breakeven costs, provide pricing fees analysis, and show the projected impact of the query fees on the merger between the NPDB and HIPDB.</p>
<p>In addition, contractor (in team or alone) must possess:</p>
<p>1. Prior experience in contracts of the type;<br />2. Have a national presence;<br />3. History of adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance;<br />4. Sufficient information management and computer resources for contract implementation;<br />5. Reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer<br />satisfaction; and<br />6. Ability to address operational issues that impact survey performance.</p>
<p>In addition, it is preferable that the Contractor has experience working with federal contracts meeting deadlines while maintaining flexibility in the work process.</p>
<p>A firm fixed price type contract is anticipated, for one year (12 months). The NAICS Code is 541690, with a small business size standard of $14.0m.</p>

<p>1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.</p>

<SUBJECT>Vibration Test Controller for electrodynamic shaker
<SOLNBR>NB688000-12-03809
<RESPDATE>062012
<CONTACT>Willa Mayns, purchasing agent, Phone 3034977305, Email mayns@nist.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought that have a product that can meet ALL of the following: <br /><br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />NB688000-12-03809
<p><br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Time and Frequency Metrology Group is a part of the Time and Frequency Division of NIST. This group has the world's most advanced measurement and calibration facilities for characterizing noise components in oscillators and frequency synthesizers. It engages in many activities to determine the cause of various kinds of electronic noise for the purpose of isolating and reducing it, leading to improved performance of components, instruments and techniques that are often necessary in new applications. Specifically, vibration resistance of oscillators and other components is increasingly important to DoD and civil applications. . <br />New requirements for (1) lower jitter, (2) higher (microwave) frequencies, (3) harsher operating environments, has made this importance more urgent. In recent years, our group has been asked by various commercial and military organizations to characterize phase noise of oscillators and different components under selected vibration environments. Measurement of phase noise determines the "vibration sensitivity", which is an important specification for oscillators on mobile systems, aircrafts, etc. Measurements of vibration sensitivity require an "electronically controlled electrodynamic shaker" which carefully shakes a device to be tested. The shaker must be able to generate one-axis vibration profiles that comply with the following military standard tests:</p>
<p>MIL-STD-810F<br />MIL-STD-188-181A<br />MIL-STD-202<br />MIL-STD-331<br />MIL-STD-167</p>
<p>The following civilian standard tests are required:<br />RTCA/DO-160<br />ASTM D 999, D 3580, D 4728<br />ISTA Series 1 and 2<br />A necessary function of the controller is "time-waveform replication." This function is the ability to record a vibration environment using the placement of a compatible acceleration sensor and play back this vibration environment as if in that place. At least one of the three linear axes must have this provision; the three rotational vibrations are not required.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>This procurement is for a "VIBRATION TEST CONTROLLER" for an Electrodynamic Shaker. Such equipment is used to electronically control the vibration of electronic components being tested under controlled vibration conditions.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>1. Time Waveform Replication (TWR)<br />2. Random Control<br />3. Swept Sine Control <br />4. Four 24 bit IEPE/Voltage/Charge inputs <br />5. Two 24 bit outputs including COLA, analog monitoring channels <br />6. 102.4 kHz sampling <br />7. Floating point DSP for close loop control<br />8. 4 GB Time replication data (TWR) size<br />9. Ethernet connection<br />10. External abort button<br />11. Stand alone operation without computer</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking sources and/or information for the US Navy Horizon Reference System (HRS) Upgrade in accordance with the Statement of Work.
<p>The aforementioned Statement of Work, Specifications, and Drawings contain Export Controlled Data and are subject to the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C SEC 2751). Contractors must be certified by the Defense Logistics Services Center and have a current DD Form 2345 (Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement) on file. To request a copy of the Statement of Work, Specifications, and Drawings, please contact Ms. Judith A. Dastis at judith.dastis@navy.mil. Please include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, with your request. For DD Form 2345 information call DLIS in Battle Creek, MI at 800-352-3572 or visit the Internet at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp.</p>
<p>The legacy US Navy Horizon Reference Set (HRS), P/N A/W37A-1, provides a stabilized horizon reference to assist helicopter pilots in landing on decks of small frigates, destroyers, and cruisers. The US Navy has been using the HRS on helicopter equipped surface combatants since the beginning of Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System MK III (LAMPS MK III) ships in the early 1980's. The current issues on the HRS include obsolescence of a number of components, but primarily the Electroluminescent (EL) panels on the stabilized bar. The legacy system also does not fully comply with the required Night Vision (NVIS) compatibility for pilots flying on devices. There is degradation of light intensity and uneven intensity when lighting panels are replaced. These issues and the availability of improvements in technology and industry advancements made in recent years, has led to the decision to upgrade the current HRS light panels.</p>
<p>The HRS Upgrade effort objective is to modernize the existing (EL) Panel Bar to LED Technology. The goal is to replace the existing EL panels with a direct form/fit/function LED panel. The benefits of the HRS Upgrade effort will include reduction of total ownership costs, improved maintainability, and reduced obsolescence. The HRS Upgrade effort will include design and drawing updates. Full functional testing and a test report will be required. Any existing documentation for environmental testing is requested.</p>
<p>Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.</p>
<p>NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. Submit your response in a Microsoft&reg; Word or compatible format document in no more than twenty-five single-sided, single-spaced pages, 12-point, Times New Roman font, using a minimum of one-inch margins. Responses to this RFI are requested by 4:00 PM on 15 July 2012. Responses should cite RFI number N68335-12-RFI-9485 and be addressed to the attention of Ms. Judith A. Dastis, Contracting Officer, Code 2.5.2.5.2JD, Highway 547, Building 562-3, Room 306, Lakehurst, NJ 08733 or electronically at: judith.dastis@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.</p>

USAID, the major recipient of funding and managing the largest portfolio of activities, will have to take a leadership role in reshaping the entire program. Another change involves the guidance from OGAC that country programs need to move to a strategy of sustainability in the near future as the resources decline. Because Global Health Initiative (GHI) funds are not available to Guyana, the budget cuts place even more pressure on the country to adopt the policy framework to take aboard the substantial programming of HIV/AIDS activities that accrued since 2003. This financial burden is a significant national budget issue for Guyana and will require close coordination with the Ministry of Finance.

<DESC>Clarification on Shipping RFQ: RCN2H3SSR00318-PVC<br><br>The shipping for this requirement will be handled by the Surface Deployment & Distribution Command (SDDC). You will have to determine what location (your firm or the supplier's facility) the product is to be picked up from. You or your suppliers are responsible for the loading of the shipment. <br><br>The SDDC will deliver 40' x 96" flat rack to said location for the loading of the pipe. The pipe cannot be stacked any higher than 77" on each rack. A container most likely will be delivered for the boxes of product. <br><br>It is very important that the correct weights and box sixes are given to ensure the correct amount of equipment is delivered for loading. It very important that you consider the height restrictions for the PVC pipe, please give me a break down of how many sticks you can secure on the 40' x 96" rack.  <br><br>Any questions please contact Hans W Jacobson @ 309-782-2480. hans.w.jacobson.civ@mail.mil  <br><br><br><br>

<DESC>Proposed Synopsis<br><br>Project Title: Construction of VMR2 Mine Hound Training Area, AA2 Training Area <br>Solicitation Number:  W911SF-12-B-0016<br> <br>The Mission & Installation Contracting Command (MICC), Fort Benning 31905-1339 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract to construct a Home Station training site that will include multiple areas and lanes such as: Calibration areas, Familiarization lanes, and IED Emplacements lanes (Top down area within the IED Emplacement lane).

The lanes shall be excavated to a minimum of 40 inches and back filled with soil screened to remove all metal and other objects larger than 2 inches. During the backing fill process, the soil shall be tamped in layers to avoid creating voids and to prevent uneven settling of the lanes.

Estimated magnitude of the requirement is between $30,000 and $43,000. It is each Bidders responsibility to download the solicitation from the internet website.  No paper copies will be provided.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Acquisition (OAQ) intends to issue a firm-fixed price sole source contract to Colonial Parking, Inc. for facilities located at 800 North Capitol Street, NW Washington, DC 20001 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy the Agency Requirements." The sole source requirement is to provide up to 26 indoor unreserved parking spaces for ICE employees with 24/7, 365 days a year access who work in offices that are located at 800 North Capitol Street, NW Washington, DC 20001. <br /><br />The Government has determined through market research that Colonial Parking, Inc. is the only known company capable of providing the required parking spaces within close proximity. Close proximity is necessary to reduce the chances of physical harm from the elements, or from imposing difficulties related to security and safety of employees (including those with disabilities) as well as the chances of negatively impacting work place access for employees on call 24/7 who must be able to enter/exit the building with complete flexibility and without delay to conduct their assigned duties. This requirement will allow the agency to comply with Executive Order 12191, the Federal Ridesharing Program, which requires Federal Agencies to implement parking incentives to promote ridesharing, as well as promoting agency compliance with title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12181) which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations.<br />&nbsp;<br />The period of performance for this service is for a 12-month period with Four (4) 12-month option periods. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting ICE's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, may be considered. This notice satisfies the requirement of FAR 5.203 for publicizing contract opportunities and is not a notice for receipt of competitive quotes. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Responses to this notice must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to award a sole source contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Francis Sierra, via email: francis.d.sierra@ice.dhs.gov at DHS, ICE Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ). All feedback received will be taken into consideration: however, the agency reserves the right to not utilize the comments or any other information provided. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. ICE is not responsible for any costs incurred by vendor responses to this notice. <br />

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(a) Method of payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>[End of clause]</p>

<CONTACT>STEPHANIE M. GARNETT, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone (206)526-6384, Fax (206)527-7169, Email STEPHANIE.M.GARNETT@NOAA.GOV
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Project Planning and Management Division - Western Region (PPMD-WR) seeks a design-build contractor to perform renovations to the existing Masonry Building at the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS) Headquarters, located in Kihei, HI (Island of Maui). The design/renovation is to include an interior renovation to convert the Masonry Building from an educational center to a combination office, wet laboratory.
<p>NOAA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed-price design-build contract utilizing a two-phased selection process. This notice represents phase one. To be considered under this solicitation, firms must possess specialized experience with the design-build construction process. Based on the responses received for phase one, the Government intends to select at least two, but no more than five, of the most highly-qualified design-build firms to submit proposals for phase two. In the event that only one proposal is received for phase one, the Government elects to continue with phase two with the one proposal received (if it is determined to be a technically qualified). The offeror(s) selected for phase two of this evaluation process will be announced in a special notice on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.</p>
<p>No detailed cost information should be submitted with the phase one submissions. Offerors selected for phase two will be asked to submit both a technical and price proposal based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP. Award of a single contract will be made to the "Best Value" offeror. Debriefings will be made available after contract award.</p>
<p>Architect-Engineering (A-E) firms that were involved in the preparation of the final schematic design and performance specifications for this project are not eligible to participate in this design-build process.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220, and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $33.5 Million dollars. This requirement is 100% set aside for small business concerns. The estimated range for this contract, including the design and construction, is between $250,000- $500,000.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Masonry Building is a single-story, 1,800 SF building of concrete-masonry-unit (CMU) construction that was built in 1954, and was originally used as an electronics building for the U.S. Navy. Ownership of the building was transferred to the National Ocean Service (NOS) in 1994. Since then, it has been used as an Educational Center.</p>
<p>The Masonry building is 60' long and 30' wide. It has a concrete (slab) floor, a gabled roof supported by wood trusses, and an open ceiling. The height from the finished floor to the bottom of the truss is 10'-11". The main portions of the interior walls are painted CMU. The portion above the main walls is tongue and groove, gable walls.</p>
<p>The Scope of Work for this project includes, the design/renovation of the interior of the building to make it a fully functional office-wet lab building, complete with areas for kitchen appliances, copier, washer/dryer (stackable), mechanical room, conference room, bathroom (toilet, sink, and shower), classroom/wet laboratory, reception area, offices, modular office area, and storage. The design must be developed to the 100% design level.</p>
<p>Schematic drawings (35%) and a basis of design narrative for the renovation of the Masonry Building as described above were prepared by Ferraro Choi and Associates in December 2008. The drawings were part of a design package for renovations of Main (Administration) Building and the Masonry Building.</p>

<DESC>Yellowstone National Park is annoucing its intent to proceed with a sole source award for the following:
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:  	6/14/2012					PR Number: Q1576120028
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost): _Upgrade of Sensus Touchread water meter reading system. The main portion of this order is being purchases by the Yellowstone Park Foundation.  We are ordering 1 Handheld upgrade AR 5002 to AR 5501 with AR 505 Master, Sensus command link, Sensus GPS, and 43 520M MXU wired upgrade from touch read to radio read.  This upgrade will save time of the USO's who read the meters and time of the technician that processes the billing.  This would be a big savings to the government.  The old units are aging and are not under warranty any longer.		
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
Only one responsible source. 
Explain:  	There are approximately 242 Sensus touch read water meters in the seven main developed area of the park. Yellowstone Park's Utility System Operators (USO) track water usage for the purpose of billing the contractors and concessionaires.  Each year, staff in Yellowstone Park process about 273,673,608 gallons of water per year. NPS has invested time and many dollars to support this system, the cost to totally switch all 242 meters to another company would be far out of our reach.  The Sensus Metering System has been provided to us under a license agreement containing restrictions on its use.  Except as stated in the license agreement, the software may not be copied or distributed in any form or medium or disclosed to third parties.  We are legally accountable for any violation of the License Agreement or of copyright law. Dana Kepner is the only authorized distributor for Sensus metering systems for this region.  This is an exclusive agreement; no one else can sell NPS this product			
 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: 	Unable to locate a product similar enough to the Sensus system to conduct a market comparison.														 4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a). 
Any vendors wishing to comment may email Andrea_Hannon@nps.gov.

<a href="mailto:michael.adorno@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is issuing a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors (Small Business) for the procurement of a new Flagship First Person Shooter (FPS).  The new FPS based game and tools should include, but is not limited, to the components and capabilities of the current FPS game, Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2), as described in the Program Description.<br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI, through requirements provided by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager, has a need for an FPS game to train individual Soldiers and small units in a shared semi-immersive environment.  This notice is provided to inform industry partners and solicit industry capabilities to fulfill the requirements and level of interest for the current GFT Flagship game-based simulation.  Part of the Army strategy for execution of the GFT program is to take advantage of new gaming technologies available in the commercial market whenever possible given the appropriate level of resources.  The Flagship recompete will manifest that strategy by acquiring improved technologies similar to user friendly software development, higher fidelity graphics, an ability to move across PC-platforms, web-based and mobile, and an improved interoperability capability to integrate seamlessly into the Live-Virtual-Constructive environment.<br><br>GFT game-based technologies provide semi-immersive, experiential learning opportunities to familiarize and train Soldiers in various tactical scenarios and environments.  This technology can be used to develop, train, and evaluate the decision making processes for the individual leaders as well as enhance teamwork at all levels.  The successful product will provide preplanned scenarios resembling the ones currently a part of the flagship baseline  along with the capability for the User to rapidly generate custom scenarios (both in preparation for a training event and in real time in the game) that provide training and education in subjects such as stability operations, cultural awareness, language, combat lifesaver skills, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) recognition and defeat, and various other skills required for current and future military operations - a flexible Full Spectrum Operations capability.<br><br>The current GFT flagship product, VBS2, was procured in a competitive source selection in Dec 08.  Over the last three years, the product has evolved to include capabilities such as terrain paging, improved graphic realism, IED training modules, insurgent methodology training scenarios, Special Operations Command(SOCOM) enhancements, an improved cultural and language training capability, and a terrain database plug-in that will facilitate incorporation of Synthetic Environment (SE) Core databases.  The Government has also invested in several middleware capabilities that provide additional features such as enhanced indirect fire skills training and combat lifesaver and medic training.  The required product will provide the User the ability to connect existing and future middleware via an Application Programming Interface (API) or plug-in.  This will enable the addition of new training capabilities for seamless training using the Flagship game as the user interface.  This will ensure the reuse of a multitude of Governmental and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) products and features already developed.   <br><br>Potential future capabilities that may be included in the Flagship acquisition, or as separate efforts, are as follows:<br><br>1.  Construction and Management Simulation (CMS) <br><br>This requirement is for a CMS game to support full spectrum operations that includes lethal and non-lethal tasks and missions.  The gaming solution must portray the political, military, economic, social, informational, and infrastructural(PMESII) conditions and associated 2d and higher order effects of decision-making relative to those conditions.  This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>2.  Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMOG)<br><br>Future procurement may include an MMOG game to support mission rehearsals and mission planning. The requirement  will allow stimulation of mission (formerly battle) command systems and other training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators (TADSS). This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>3.  Real Time Strategy (RTS)<br><br>Plans for FY13 and beyond may include procurement of an RTS game to support full spectrum operations. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>4.  Turn Based Strategy (TBS) <br><br>Future procurement endeavors may include a TBS game to support decision making skills at all force echelons. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>Constraints<br><br>1.  The contractor shall provide all the features of VBS2.<br><br>2.  The contractor shall use industry standards for model, terrain and other content imported into the game. <br><br>3.  The Flagship will be capable of importing and exporting Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) simulation terrain and Common Moving Models as well as One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) behavioral models.<br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates this requirement be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The Government intends to award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated herein and to submit a written response (questions and/or feedback) by the closing date of this posting.  The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections in order to allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.<br><br>QUANTITIES:  The acquisition will be for an Army-wide or enterprise license for one or more commercial games.<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $44.5 million over five years. The majority of the cost is expected to be an annual licensing fee that includes an update and technical support for the software.<br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) requests contractors who are responding to the Draft RFP posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) as well as FEDBIZOPPS to submit their questions/feedback to the following POC: Michael.adorno@us.army.mil. All questions/comments are due no later than 3:00PM EST on 12 July 2012. Please identify your Business Size Standard.  If vendor is a small business, provide how you plan on meeting the limitations on subcontracting per FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.<br><br>DISCLAIMER:  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use the information received to assist in the development of the GFT Flagship requirements.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>   <br><br>

<CONTACT>Nicole Bennett, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014437604, Email nicole.bennett@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The Program Support Center on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)/ Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) intends to negotiate and award a Task Order award on a sole source, noncompetitive basis. This award will go to IFC Incorporated, L.L.C for a service contract renewal for managing the information resources of the Developmental Disability Network through data collection, synthesis, and dissemination.</p>
<p>The ADD is the lead agency within ACF at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for planning and administering programs that promote self-sufficiency and protect the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities. The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act of 2000) (42 U.S.C. 15001, et seq.) supports and provides assistance to States, public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of, and have access to needed community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion in all facets of community life.</p>
<p>Under this procurement, the Contractor shall support planning, implementation, and development of strategies, technologies, and media channels for management of ADD program information resources. The program information will include but will not be limited to, products and reports from each ADD grantee. The Contractor shall implement strategies for analysis of grantee reports, and will disseminate useful information through channels identified by ADD. These channels include both electronic and printed means. To this end, the Contractor shall, as appropriate:<br />&bull; Maintain and strengthen the ADD Internet and Intranet websites located on the HHS-designated server, which will be accessible to persons with disabilities and in compliance with Federal law and HHS policies. Link the website to other Federal sites, grantee sites, and new media as approved by HHS, and market the website for optimum benefit to ADD and its partners.<br />&bull; As appropriate, provide technical assistance to grantees and ADD staff on data collection systems approved by ADD to include data collection systems specific to the Councils on Developmental Disabilities, Protection and Advocacy Systems, and University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities. These systems will accept interactive electronic submission of key measures and indicators, including but not limited to State Plans, Statements of Goals and Priorities, and Program Performance Reports. <br />&bull; Analyze data for identifying trends, needs, and items of programmatic, managerial, or research significance. Disseminate (electronic and print media) information resources derived from quantitative and qualitative analyses. <br />&bull; Develop, import, and maintain a database driven component of the information gleaned from ADD grantees. This component is to be designed to provide a central repository for documents and allow for process consistency and increased productivity. This will allow the ADD staff to get a complete view of related data, including grant applications, awards, budgets, PPRs, state plans and correspondence. This data dashboard would also provide extensive reporting capabilities and would include the ability to output data in multiple formats. The content needs to be accessible, by language and delivery mechanism. <br />&bull; In the event that ADD transitions to a document management system, the Contractor will manage the process and data. As appropriate, the Contractor shall warrant that each hardware, software, and firmware product delivered under this contract shall be able to accurately process data when used in accordance with the product documentation provided by the Contractor. The Contractor will ensure that all listed products (e.g. hardware, software, firmware) used are compatible with the document management system.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is 12 months. <br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement may be submitted to the Program Support Center (PSC) Strategic Acquisition Service/ Division of Acquisition Management A, 12501 Ardennes Ave, Suite 400, Rockville, MD 20852 to the attention of Nicole Bennett, Contract Specialist at nicole.bennett@psc.hhs.gov.</p>

SECTION M. PART A. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS
1.	The source selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Sub-Part 15.3 with the intention to award a single, fixed-price contract with option periods. 
2.	The evaluation of factors other than cost or price, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price. 3.	Evaluation Scoring: The Government will evaluate all offerors according to the following point system. 
70 Points - Outstanding: The response is comprehensive, in-depth, and clear. Proposal consistently meets the solicitation requirements without omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected. 
50 Points - Excellent: Extensive, detailed response to all requirements, similar to outstanding in quality but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected. 
30 Points - Satisfactory: The response generally meets requirements, but there is no expectation of better than acceptable performance. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without minor revision to the proposal. 
10 Points - Poor: The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas, but can be corrected during negotiations without major revision to the proposal, or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact. 
0 Points - Unsatisfactory: Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present. 

SECTION M. PART B. EVALUATION CRITERIA
FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY. Technical Approach.  (1) The Technical Approach shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary, to fully explain the technical approach. (2) The technical approach should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work to be performed successfully as required by the Statement of Work (SOW), and an understanding of the Bureau of Indian Education's goals and objectives for the project. The technical approach should include, but is not be limited to the following: (a) Description of the processes the offeror routinely uses to provide occupational therapy services, and (b) Description of conditions which can affect achieving the BIE goals and objectives.
FACTOR 2:  Knowledge and Experience The offeror shall demonstrate knowledge and experience by submitting resume(s) for key personnel. Key personnel are defined as those individuals the offeror views as essential to successfully performing its proposal technical approach and SOW. The offeror shall provide copies of an active State issued licenses of key personnel who will be performing occupational therapy services. 
FACTOR 3:  PAST PERFORMANCE. The Past Performance narrative shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary to fully explain the offeror's past performance. The offeror's past performance must be recent, having been performed in the last five (5) years. The offeror must describe how its past performance is on a scale similar in size to this requirement. The strength of the offeror's response will be based on the implementation of occupational therapy services and benefits/achievement(s) of students who have received occupational therapy services.  Provide reference and phone numbers of Contracting Officer's Representative/points-of-contact from past contracts. Specifically, the offeror shall demonstrate its knowledge of occupational therapy services. The offeror must demonstrate their experience and knowledge to positive improvement and/or successful results of students who have received occupational services, without revealing the personal identity of students.

SECTION M. PART B. BASIS OF AWARD
The Government will evaluate each offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness. The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.
Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. 
The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 
The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.
Price proposals shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1.	Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc); 2.	Indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  3.	Inclusive of any Federal, State, and Local taxes, in accordance with FAR 52.212-4 (k) Taxes, FAR 52.229-01, FAR 52.229-04 and FAR 52.229-10.  
Offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor, if applicable. The offeror has public access at http://www.dol.gov/ to locate the prevailing wage rates for their area.  
The Government reserves the right to make award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in the proposal. Omissions of response may be considered non-responsive and may not be evaluated. If exchanges are necessary, the Government will conduct exchanges consistent with FAR 15.306, Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals. 
An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract or purchase order from the Federal Government pursuant to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008).

<CONTACT>Monica Y. Watts, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-344-2938, Fax 202-344-1254, Email monica.watts@dhs.gov
<DESC>CBP intends to award a modification to the sole source agreement awarded December 23, 2011 to Chenega Technology Services Corporation (CTSC) for a one-year option period to continue program management and integrated logistics support (ILS) services to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This modification will combine six one-month option periods originally awarded and add an additional six months of service in order create a one-year option period. Through this modification, CTSC and its subcontractors will be required to continue support for technically-complex and high-value inspection, detection, and surveillance equipment systems currently used by CBP/ETP to assist in securing the land border crossings, airports, seaports, rail crossings, mail handling, and express cargo consignment facilities within the United States and participating countries.
<p>CTSC possesses the experience and expertise for continued non-personal, program management and ILS services to CBP without unacceptable delays. CTSC has detailed and comprehensive knowledge of the CBP contractual instruments and knowledge of the CBP programs. Any attempt to bring another vendor up-to-speed on these requirements would necessitate an unacceptable delay in the continued protection of our Nation's borders. CTSC has proven its considerable value to CBP on this task. Their unique knowledge and skills are indispensable at this point in time and failure to continue their services would jeopardize the protection of our nation's borders. In addition to jeopardizing our border protection, the government also faces the possible removal of proprietary equipment specifically developed by their subcontractors for our border protection. A continuation of the bridge award to CTSC is clearly in the government's best interest. An 8(a) competitive follow-on procurement is being processed to begin and allow a three month transition period before this bridge effort ends. The bridge effort is necessary in order to provide sufficient time to complete the competitive follow-on award.</p>
<p>This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to be used for consideration of future requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and an RFP will not be issued. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted; only email responses will be accepted. All responses must be received by 11:59 am, EST June 29, 2012.</p>

In addition, the local law enforcement, fire departments and emergency services also utilize this brand of radio. This will allow HDIFC EOC/ERT personnel continued access to the MPSCS that is necessary to ensure effective facility-wide communications with local, county, state and federal resources during an emergency. Per DOD Instruction 6055.17, the HDI Federal Center must stay uniform with the equipment local support uses. This is to ensure interconnectivity between the parties. Finally, the radios will receive programing from the State of Michigan. All of the templates have been created for programing this particular radio and to change the programming would incur an additional cost.</p>

<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov.  From the VSC home page, click on Toolbox in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules.  The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

B) Panasonic projectors are replacing existing older projectors. The current ceiling mounts will be re-used and the Creston control systems are programmed for Panasonic projectors. C) The Da-Lite screen is replacing an existing damaged screen. In an effort to reduce cost, the existing mount which houses the electronics used to raise and lower the screen, will be re-used and requires a Da-Lite screen. D) The Sony Anycast will supplement an existing Anycast for use in field-delivered courses. Staff are fully trained in using the existing Anycast, which is complex with numerous features, and it will eliminate downtime related to re-training.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a proposal for the following line items:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) Liquid Chromatograph (LC) coupled to a Hybrid Triple Quadrupole-Orbital Trap Mass Spectrometer (MS). Later referred to as an LC-MS system.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, and services to fabricate, install and test one LC-MS system.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p><br />The Organic Chemical Metrology Group within the Analytical Chemistry Division is responsible for the development of a wide variety of Reference Materials (RMs) and Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) that support accuracy and comparability of chemical measurements. In recent years high resolution separation techniques have been explored in order to increase measurement capabilities. Among the high resolution technologies explored include, ultra high pressure liquid chromatography, the use of new smaller/pelicular stationary phases, and two dimensional separation techniques. These techniques are yielding new discoveries and new measurements in environmental chemistry, proteomics, metabolomics, clinical diagnostics and food safety. Ideally, a mass spectrometer that can be used for the identification of unknown analytes in complex matrices and the quantitation of known analytes should be one of the detectors on the high resolution separation systems. Our existing liquid chromatography mass spectrometry instrumentation is good for either qualitative identification or quantitation, but not both. We have a Dionex 2DLC and the new MS must be compatible with that instrument and come with a modern LC that can operate up to 100 MPa for use with newer, higher resolution, small particle stationary phases.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements:</p>
<p>The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below. All items must be new and commercially available. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Liquid Chromatograph (LC)</p>
<p>a. The LC system must include a high pressure binary gradient pump, an integrated solvent tray/degasser, an autosampler, a thermostated column compartment, a UV absorbance detector, and a fluorescence detector.<br />b. The system must have an integrated degasser with at least two channels.<br />c. The binary pump must be capable of operating from 0.05 to 8 mL/min<br />d. The binary pump must be capable of operating in the pressure range of 2 MPa to 80 MPa or greater across the entire flow range.<br />e. The binary pump must be capable of operating at 100 MPa or greater at a flow rate of 2 mL/min<br />f. The autosampler must be capable of reproducible injection volumes ranging from 0.1 microliters to 100 microliters.<br />g. The autosampler must provide injection precision of 0.5 percent RSD or better for full loop injections<br />h. The autosampler must be capable of sampling from either well plates or vials<br />i. The autosampler must include capabilities for programmable needle washing<br />j. The column compartment must be capable of maintaining the temperature constant with temperatures ranging from at least 5 degrees Celsius to 105 degrees Celsius <br />k. The column compartment must have temperature accuracy &plusmn; 1 degrees Celsius or better<br />l. The column compartment must be able to support at least two columns of 25 cm length<br />m. The UV absorbance detector must be capable of operation in the range of 190 nm - 700 nm<br />n. The UV absorbance detector must have two temperature controlled lamps deuterium and tungsten<br />o. The UV absorbance detector must be capable of collecting data from at least three wavelengths<br />p. Fluorescence detector must be capable of a data collection rate of 200 Hz<br />q. Fluorescence detector must be capable of collecting data from at least three channels<br />r. Fluorescence detector must have a maximum cell volume of 3 microliters<br />s. Full integration of the functions of the LC and the hybrid mass spectrometer must be possible through a single software package</p>
<p>Mass Spectrometer (MS)</p>
<p>a. The hybrid mass spectrometer instrument must include two mass spectrometer components: a quadrupole mass filter and an electrostatic orbital trap (orbitrap) <br />b. The instrument must accommodate interchangeable ionization sources, including ESI, APCI, and APPI<br />c. The instrument must be able to acquire and display full scan mass spectra<br />d. The instrument must be able to acquire and display selected ion monitoring (SIM) data<br />e. The instrument must be capable of scheduling timed SIM data acquisition<br />f. The instrument must be able to acquire and display full scan MS/MS spectra<br />g. The instrument must be capable of detecting both negative and positive ions<br />h. The instrument must be capable of providing resolving power of 140,000 (FWHM) or better at m/z 200 with a mass accuracy of 5 ppm or better<br />i. The mass spectrometer must be capable of operation in the mass range of 50-4000 Da<br />j. The mass spectrometer must not require liquid cooling<br />k. Full integration of the functions of our current Dionex two dimensional liquid chromatograph and the hybrid mass spectrometer must be possible through a single software package<br />l. The instrument software must be compatible with Chromeleon 6.8 data acquisition and management software so that the data is compatible with our current chromatography instrumentation data.</p>

If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. <br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the proposal and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.<br /><br />Past Performance, Experience, and Price may not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NLM-2012-365/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.<br /><br />
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to provide technical and operational support to the NLM Ethics Office staff in its implementation of the NIH Ethics program requirements and the provision of timely and efficient ethics services to management and employees. This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611-Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.<br /></p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Ethics Office within the Executive Office is responsible for management of the NLM Ethics Program. The NLM Ethics Office is charged with providing technical advice, support, guidance, and resources to the Library=s programs to implement the ethics policies, procedures and guidance promulgated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Ethics Program. This requires appropriate resources and staff with extensive knowledge of and expertise in the interpretation and application of Federal ethics statutes, Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch regulations, HHS Supplemental Standards of Conduct regulations, and NIH ethics regulations and policies and the ability to translate that knowledge into useable resources for the NLM community.</p>
<p>2.0 Objective</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to provide technical and operational support to the NLM Ethics Office staff in its implementation of the NIH Ethics program requirements and the provision of timely and efficient ethics services to management and employees.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope</p>
<p>The work requirement covers all areas of the NLM Ethics program including data management via the use of the current NIH Ethics Enterprise System (NEES) and the Ethics Management Information System (EMIS), and the evaluation of program implementation. Due to additional responsibilities, time constraints, and other workload requirements, the following services and products are required to support, maintain, and enhance the ability of the NLM ethics staff to provide ethics services to the NLM community.</p>
<p>4.0 Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not other&not;wise provided by the Government, to perform task assignments at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in the following Task Areas. All work shall be monitored and technically co&not;ordinated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>4.1 Task Area 1: Program Evaluation</p>
<p>In preparation for an external program review, the Contractor shall conduct a thorough internal review of the ethics program procedures, actions, and files for the purpose of evaluating compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and established NIH Ethics Office and HHS ethics policies and procedures as well as evaluating the use of the NEES system in the action review process. The review includes a technical evaluation of processes as well as an evaluation of analyses, reviews, recommendations, and decisions made by the NLM ethics staff on a variety of ethics actions. This evaluation will involve the review of physical files and electronic documents. The Contractor shall conduct the review and provide a written report of findings. The review will require approximately 40 hours.</p>
<p>4.2 Task Area 2: Program Activities</p>
<p>The NLM Ethics Office needs additional assistance during periods of high work load levels or difficult situations. For example, the NLM Ethics Coordinator may need assistance with a Contractor to review financial disclosure reports and outside activities, the development of written procedures, assistance with technical review of other ethics documents, review and preparation of responses to the Department and/or Congress, or conduct research for responses to ethics questions posed by management or employees. The Contractor shall provide assistance in the preparation of general ethics guidance when needed and in the technical review of ethics documents. In addition, the Contractor shall develop training aids and participate in employee training sessions as needed. This requires a vendor with substantive knowledge of and demonstrated expertise in interpreting and applying Federal government ethics statutes, the Standards of Ethical Conduct regulations, HHS Supplemental Standards of Conduct regulations and ethics policies; ability to provide succinct, thorough, and correct advice; and time to work on special projects as they arise. This portion will be on an as needed basis but will require approximately 40 hours.</p>
<p>4.3 Task Area 3: Data Management Support (EMIS &amp; NEES)</p>
<p>The NIH Ethics Office requires that all data regarding ethics documents be entered in the EMIS system on an on-going regular basis. It is a high priority to maintain NLM's data in the EMIS database and enter new data as appropriate and consistent with current system requirements. The project requires a Contractor knowledgeable in both ethics requirements and IT terminology and expertise in utilizing the system in order to quickly populate the database in an efficient and accurate manner. The Contractor shall be responsible for performing technical review of data, identifying and entering needed data into the system, reviewing data to ensure that correct information is entered, and working with NLM users to enhance their ability to use EMIS. As NIH continues to roll out new applications on the NEES system, the Contractor may assist with new requirements of this particular system. This portion may take approximately 20 hours.</p>
<p>5.0 Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from the Date of Award with four (4) additional 12-month option year periods.</p>
<p>6.0 Deliverables/Delivery Schedule</p>
<p>Deliverable SOW Provision Due Date<br />Task Area 1: Program Evaluation - 4.1 As assigned by the COTR<br />Task Area 2: Program Activities - 4.2 As assigned by the COTR<br />Task Area 3: Data Management Support (EMIS &amp; NEES) -&nbsp;4.3 As assigned by the COTR<br /><br />7.0 Security/Confidentiality</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to maintain security and confidentiality of all Government information.</p>
<p>8.0 Government Furnished Equipment/Government Furnished Information: The Government will provide:<br />*access to the web server containing the site(s) to be maintained (user name, VPN account);<br />*ongoing project review to assure compliance;<br />*appropriate information needed for new projects; and<br />*timely follow up and feedback for submitted projects.</p>
<p>9.0 Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations: It is expected that most of the work can and will be done remotely, e.g., not at the NLM, with the exception of the physical review of files which will be done on site. Travel to the NLM office will be required on occasion. NLM will pay reasonable travel expenses (for non-local vendor, includes air fare, per diem, local transportation).</p>
<p>10.0 Evaluation Factors and Criteria</p>
<p>Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among price and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:</p>
<p>A. Technical Merit (40 Points) - quality and clarity of approach to accomplish the objectives of this statement of work. Evidence of ability to accomplish the specific tasks described.</p>

Past Performance (30 points)</p>
<p>&bull; The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The Government will look to evaluate how the offeror has completed similar tasks. The Government will examine the offeror's track record on developing ethics guidance and training materials. The Government will examine the offeror's demonstrated experience interpreting and applying Federal ethics statutes, the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch regulations, and the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of DHHS and the offeror's demonstrated knowledge of NIH ethics regulations.</p>
<p>&bull; The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirement as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>&bull; The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. <br /><br />11.0 ARTICLE H-NIH INFORMATION AND PHYSICAL ACCESS SECURITY</p>

<DESC>The Louisiana Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) located in Alexandria, LA, is hereby seeking Request for Proposals (RFP) for a fixed-price contract to grow, transport, and plant various species of coastal wetland plants for the LA-39 South Lake Decade Vegetative Planting Project located in Terrebonne Parish, LA as more fully provided in the plans and specifications attached and made a part hereof.&nbsp; This is a Total Small Business Set Aside under NAICS Code 115112.&nbsp; The estimated magnitude is between $100,000 and $250,000.<br /><br />The Offeror is required to provide a detailed technical and cost proposal outlining their methodology, labor and equipment to complete the work identified in the attached plans and specifications.&nbsp; The technical and cost proposals shall provide for the following:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The source(s) of all plants to include the number and type of plants to be supplied (nursery name, mailing and physical address, phone number, name of nursery contact person) to be utilized by the contractor in performance of work under this contract.&nbsp; The contractor shall not change the selected source(s) of plants after award of the contract.&nbsp; If any of the required plants are to be grown/produced in ponds with a direct hydrologic connection to a natural intermediate, brackish or saline wetland ecosystem, a map indicating the location and boundaries of the growing site(s) shall also be provided.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; A legible copy of a current state nursery license and/or permit issued to the nursery (or nurseries) to be utilized by the contractor under this contract.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Certification that plant material of all required genus and species, and if specified, variety or cultivar, is on the premises of the specified nursery (or nurseries) responsible for growing operations in an amount sufficient to propagate the required number of contract plug or containerized (potted) transplants identified in the plans and specifications.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; A detailed work plan with timeline which addresses the growing, transporting, staging, planting locations, configurations, the method for locating correct plant position and the sequencing of planting operations including mobilization and demobilization.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Describe the credentials and qualifications of your proposed personnel to show experience and knowledge performing the requirements of the plans and specifications.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; Explain the makeup of your crews and personnel for completion of the work identified in the plans and specifications to include information on the planting crew size and production rate for planting.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; List of proposed equipment to be utilized during the planting operations and methods of digging holes and placement of plants.<br /><br />8.&nbsp; List and explain the proposed subcontractors and the responsibilities relative to the completion of the work identified in the plans and specifications.<br /><br />9.&nbsp; The Offeror shall submit information on contracts considered most relevant in demonstrating the Offeror's ability to perform the proposed effort.&nbsp; The Offeror shall submit a list of contracts either currently being performed or contracts that have been completed within the last five (5) years.&nbsp; For each relevant contract, the Offeror shall provide the name, contract number, address and telephone number of the contact.&nbsp; In addition, each Offeror shall provide a brief summary of the type of work completed.<br /><br />10.&nbsp; If subcontractors will be used for more than 50% of the work, then include a summary of their work experience and at least five (5) of their most recent jobs performed for similar work, with name, address, POC, telephone number of owner or prime contractor.<br /><br />11.&nbsp; Schedule B - Supplies/Services/Prices<br /><br />12.&nbsp; Schedule K - Certifications and Representations<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br /><br />Offerors will be evaluated according to the following evaluation criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Price -&nbsp;The costs will be evaluated upon the Offeror's ability to demonstrate associated costs with the project in order for the Government to determine reasonableness of price. A comparison of the proposed prices, government estimate and/or market values will be used. Cost realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort may be conducted. The Government will evaluate whether costs reflect a clear understanding of the program requirements and are reasonable and consistent with the various elements of the offer/quote. Offerors are put on notice that any offer/quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity of contract requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the offer/quote. In addition, the offeror must meet the requirement for responsibility as defined in FAR 9.104. <br /><br />2. Technical Capability - The Government will evaluate an Offeror's technical capability to determine an offeror's ability to meet the requirements identified in the plans and specifications. The merit of the offeror's proposed approach to accomplish the work identified in the plans and specifications will be assessed. This includes the reasonableness of the proposed work plan, scheduling and necessary certifications for achieving the project objectives. For an offer to be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of all requirements and demonstrate that, as a contractor, they have the technical capabilities identified above. The Technical Capability focuses on strengths, weaknesses and deficiencies in the Offeror's proposal. Offerors are advised that any strengths accepted by the Government may be incorporated into the contract as the minimum performance requirement. For the purposes of the proposal, a deficiency is defined as a "failure of a offeror to meet the Government requirement". The technical capabilities will be evaluated against the Offeror's ability to provide for sufficient staff and personnel with sufficient expertise to accomplish the contract requirements. The technical capabilities will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's ability to plan, control and integrate personnel necessary for successful contract performance. <br /><br />3. Past Performance - The offer/quote will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's relevancy and quality of past experience in performing the work described in the plans and specifications.<br /><br />Where the relevant present and past performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken, not just planned or promised action. If the Offeror clearly demonstrates that management actions employed in overcoming problems resulted in improvements achieved or problems rectified, this may allow the Offeror to be rated higher than might otherwise be indicated.<br /><br />All offerors will be given an opportunity to respond to any adverse past performance information obtained by the evaluation team for which the Offeror did not previously have an opportunity to address. Adverse past performance information is defined as information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element in past performance or contained in Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information System (PPIRS) or any less than satisfactory comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />Offerors without a record of relevant present and past performance, or for whom information on present and past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on present and past performance but will receive an "unknown" rating for the past performance factor.
<p>4. Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to price. <br /><br />The technical and cost proposal is due no later than Monday, July 16, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. Central Time.</p>

This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price quotes for the procurement of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Solicitation number HSCG38-12-Q-300043 is assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-59.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the small business size standard is 1000 employees. This combined synopsis / solicitation is issued on a Sole Source basis.</p>
<p>The sole source contractor is GE Aviation DBA Dowty Propellers, 114 Powers Court, Sterling VA 20166-9321. Cage code is 93366. <br />These items are utilized on the USCG C-130J Aircraft.</p>
<p>Description of the Requirement:</p>

<p>These items are to be manufactured in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer's Manual. Used, reconditioned, overhauled, or remanufactured material is not acceptable. <br />Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of LRS aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Burma will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future State Department and USAID presence in Burma. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition in Burma. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Rangoon, Burma as the senior OTI representative in the country. This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight, and management of DCHA/OTI's Burma country program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and local government officials.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.<br />&emsp;<br />9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for the Asia Regional Team, the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>

<p>&bull; Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for the Asia Regional Team, or his/her designee, as well as to the Burma Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI/Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.<br /><br />Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country&rsquo;s political process.<br /><br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office&rsquo;s programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) &ndash; such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.&nbsp; However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers&rsquo; compensation, among other benefits.&nbsp; For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.<br /><br />The OTI program in Burma will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future State Department and USAID presence in Burma. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition in Burma. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI&rsquo;s rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.<br /><br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br /><br />The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Burma.&nbsp; This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The Deputy Country Representative&rsquo;s principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.&nbsp; <br /><br />OBJECTIVE<br /><br />The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.<br /><br />&emsp;<br />9.&nbsp; CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY<br /><br />DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br /><br />The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.&nbsp; As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Deputy Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.&nbsp; The Deputy Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.&nbsp; S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.

The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.&nbsp; Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo;<br /><br />(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.&nbsp; The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.&nbsp; When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).<br /><br />(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:<br /><br />(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;<br /><br />(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care;

In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.&nbsp; The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.&nbsp; The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.&nbsp; In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.<br /><br />(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.&nbsp; In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.&nbsp; In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.&nbsp; The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.<br /><br />(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.&nbsp; The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.&nbsp; When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.&nbsp; As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.&nbsp; If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.<br /><br />(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.<br /><br />(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.&nbsp; If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />

Exactly what are the panel types at each location?<br>	      (c)  How many smoke, pull stations, water flow connections and tamper switches are in each Building?<br>	     (d)  The contract requires randomly testing 15-20% of smoke and heat detectors in the Building, 10% of pull stations, 100% of the batteries in the main and extender panels, etc. during annual maintenance.  Can you please provide a complete list of all panels, extenders, and quantity counts for all building fire alarm related devices outlined in each facility outlined on the documents so that we can determine the required amount of fire alarm devices that require inspection?<br>	     (e) During our walk through it was stated that there were several Fike and Kidde suppression systems located throughout the Depot that were outlined on the list provided but should not be tested/inspected as part of the contract.  However, it was also stated that several Fike and Kidde control panels were included on the list that are being used as building alarm panels and require inspection/testing as part of this contract.  Can you please confirm and differentiate for us which of the Fike and Kidde control panels outlined on the document are being used as suppression related detection systems that need to be left off or our test/inspect schedule and which of those systems are being utilized as building related detection systems that should be included in our test/inspect schedule?<br>	     (f) When traveling from building to building during our walk thru it was noticed by several prospective bidders that there were building numbers on property that were not outlined in the bid documents.  Do all the buildings on property have building related fire alarm systems installed within them?  If so, are all the buildings on Depot property outlined on the list you've provided in the document?<br>	     (g)  Are there other building fire alarm systems that are not on the SOW?<br><br>	A1.  Please refer to the revised Paragraph 1.1, List of Fire Alarm Systems at Tobyhanna Army Depot, and all subparagraphs, provided as Attachment 1 to this Amendment 0001 as per this amendment Paragraph 1 above.<br><br>2.

Since warehouse heights are at 25 feet or above, a lift will be required to service/clean/test cameras and indicating devices."<br><br>	Offeror questions received with the government's response:<br>	Q3 (a) If there are cameras as part of a fire alarm system, how many are there and where are they?<br>	      (b)  Cameras 2.1.5-E section how many cameras are there and in which buildings are they located?  Also will a lift be required to service them when cleaning is required?<br>	      (c)  In the specification under 2.1.5 e - all cameras that are used will be cleaned with manufactured approved material once every year.  Are these cameras under this contract to be tested and cleaned?  If so, how many cameras and what buildings have cameras?<br>	      (d)  Are there any areas where a lift may be required to test any indicating devices?<br>	A2.  There are a total of forty (40) cameras which are all located in Building 4, Bays 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Multiple warehouse heights are at 25 feet or higher, therefore a lift may be required to service the cameras and indicating devices.  See Attachment 1, Paragraph 2.1.5 e) as per this amendment Paragraph 3 above.<br><br>4.  Reference combined Synopsis/Solicitation W25G1V-12-R-0026, Attachment 1, Paragraph 2.1.5 b), ADD:  "The government will provide a composite drawing of the building and the contractor will mark the drawings as to which units were tested."<br><br>	Offeror questions received with the government's response:<br>	Q4.  The contract requires a report showing a drawing with the locations of all units that were tested with the results during the annual maintenance.  Does the Depot have drawings that can be turned over to us which outline all fire alarm devices located in each and every facility outlined in the contract document?  If not, can a sample copy of an existing inspection report that outlines a similar drawing be provided to us prior to submission of this proposal?<br>	A4.  A composite drawing of the building will be provided by the government.  The contractor will mark the drawings as to which units were tested.  There has not been preventive maintenance performed on the fire alarm system in the past, therefore a sample report is not available.  See Attachment 1, Paragraph 2.1.5 b), as per this amendment Paragraph 4 above. <br><br>5.  Reference combined Synopsis/Solicitation W25G1V-12-R-0026, Attachment 1, Paragraph 7.1, after "The contractor" ADD: "or subcontractor".  <br><br>	Offeror question received with the government's response:<br>	Q5.

Are testing and repairs limited only to building fire alarm systems list in the SOW?<br>	A6.  Yes, testing and repairs are limited to the building systems listed in the Performance Work Statement. <br>	        <br>	Q7.  Can and/or does the government intend to add additional buildings to the existing list of building requiring service and testing?    <br>	A7.  Refer to Attachment 1 to this Amendment 0001 for the revised Paragraph 1.1, List of Fire Alarm Systems at Tobyhanna Army Depot.  Proposals will be based on the building list provided in the Performance Work Statement.<br> <br>	Q8.  Can a copy of the existing site specific APP and AHA be provided to us for our review?     <br>	A8.  There has not been a previous contract for the preventive maintenance on the fire alarm system; therefore a copy of an existing site specific APP and AHA does not exist.  Refer to Appendix A of EM 385-1-1 for the format to be used.  EM 385-1-1 can be accessed on the US Corps of Engineer website at http://www.usace.army.mil/SafetyandOccupationalHealth/.    <br><br>	Q9 (a)  During our walk thru it was stated that the contract includes the testing of the building alarm related devices only and the ancillary devices such as water flow switches, tamper switches, kitchen hood equipment, interface points, etc. are not included in our testing.  Please confirm that our inspections shall include the testing of the interface monitoring modules associated with the building fire alarm systems themselves and that the ancillary devices/wiring (i.e. flows, tampers, pressure switches, kitchen hood switches, interface wiring, etc) associated with these modules are not to be included in our inspection?  <br>	      (b) It doesn't appear that there are any provisions for testing/inspecting any of the audible/visual devices associated with any of the building fire alarm systems or related mass notification systems.  Is the testing of these units required to be included or excluded from this contract?<br>	A9.  Preventive maintenance includes the testing of devices that are listed in the Performance Work Statement and the contractor will only be responsible for testing of these devices.  Refer to revised Performance Work Statement provided as Attachment 1 to this Amendment 0001.<br><br>	Q10.  Can we get a printout sampling of breakdown issues that the Vision 21 system reported for a specified period of time to see a "sampling" say for two months or so?    <br>	A10.  A printout of breakdown issues is currently not available.    <br>	<br>	Q11.  In the past 6 months have you had a company on site every day to maintain system?  How much were your expenditures for maintenance for the last 6 months?    <br>	A11.  There has not been a company maintaining the system in the past.  Only as-needed repairs have been made.   <br><br>	Q12.  What hours do you expect to be included in the contract bid?  8am to 4pm Mon-Fri?  And are after hours/weekends billable?    <br>	A12.  Per Performance Work Statement Paragraph 2.1.3 the contractor is required to report to Building 17 each weekday morning at 8 A.M. to look at the Vision 21 systems and make repairs as needed to remove the alarms, supervisory and troubles.  Per Performance Work Statement Paragraph 2.1.1 a) the contractor shall submit a schedule of all scheduled maintenance within five (5) days after receipt of award.  It is anticipated the scheduled maintenance and remedial repair will be performed during normal duty hours of 8 AM - 4 PM Monday through Friday.  Response to emergency calls may occur after normal hours or weekends and will follow the procedures noted in subparagraph 2.1.6.5 of the Performance Work Statement.<br><br>	Q13.  Attachment #4 Register of wages determination - how does this pertain to the RFP?  Are these minimums that must be paid?  Do we have to pay our tech for Electronic Technician Rate listed with vacation time & holidays as listed in this section?  Again, how does this attachment pertain to us?  <br>	A13.   This requirement comes under the Service Contract Act.  Reference combined synopsis/solicitation W25G1V-12-R-0026, Clause 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965 which states "each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor or authorized representative and specified in any wage determination attached to the solicitation."  Attachment #4, WD 05-2453, is the applicable wage determination for Monroe County, PA and these are the minimums that must be paid for the applicable labor category used.  <br><br>	Q14.  From past performance - Do you expect the contractor will be on-site on a full time basis?<br>	A14.  A previous fire alarm maintenance contract does not exist.  The government will not speculate.<br><br>	Q15 (a) Can you supply an inventory of devices per FACP per bldg?<br>	        (b) Will you be sending out field device counts to better help us come up with our competitive bid?<br>	A15.  Refer to the attached point listing provided as Attachment 2 to this Amendment 0001.  This is all of the available data.<br> <br>7.   Attachment 3 to this Amendment 0001 is a Depot map for contractors information showing layout and location of buildings listed in the Performance Work Statement. <br><br>8.  The Proposal due date has been extended:  DELETE:  25 JUNE 2012 @ 3:00 P.M.<br>						        ADD:   27 JUNE 2012 @ 3:00 P.M.      <br><br>9.  All other terms, conditions, and requirements of the solicitation remain the same. <br> <br>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

All replacement batteries, network management modules, monitoring software and telecomm rack rails are from APC. If another vendor is used, DLA Logistics Information Service will also need to purchase replacement batteries, network monitoring cards, monitoring software and rack rails from this vendor. DLA Logistics Information Service is required to procure IT equipment that will conform to the standardization of IT equipment within the agency. Also, this allows for interchangeability of components as required. This is to ensure that all PLFA's use standard like equipment and will not fall into a proprietary system of maintenance and failure. Keeping one vendor greatly increases the response time in detecting vulnerabilities, testing patches and applying to production equipment. Mixing vendor maintenance throughout the network has the potential to cause infrastructure instability.</p>

<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements only Motorola radios will meet the requirements of the Government. The brand name Motorola is required to ensure the radios are compatible. The HDI Federal Center utilizes 800 MHz Motorola radios and to ensure that these work properly with the new radios, Motorola will be required. In addition, the local law enforcement, fire departments and emergency services also utilize this brand of radio. This will allow HDIFC EOC/ERT personnel continued access to the MPSCS that is necessary to ensure effective facility-wide communications with local, county, state and federal resources during an emergency. Per DOD Instruction 6055.17, the HDI Federal Center must stay uniform with the equipment local support uses. This is to ensure interconnectivity between the parties. Finally, the radios will receive programing from the State of Michigan. All of the templates have been created for programing this particular radio and to change the programming would incur an additional cost.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the April 2012 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-58. This acquisition is a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541690. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. This is a labor hour contract.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM), Specialized Information Services (SIS) has a requirement to create new content, enhance existing content, and procure support for content building activities for the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) Website. The award will be for a Base Year with options for two (2) successive one-year periods. The CHEMM tool is designed to provide access to comprehensive sets of information via a user-friendly interface. The users include first responders, first receivers, other health care providers, and planners. CHEMM allows these users to plan, respond, recover, and mitigate the effects of incidents involving chemicals. CHEMM's unique content covers information especially relevant to chemical exposure-related mass casualty and "unusual" scenarios. CHEMM's expert interface will link users to resources from other organizations, e.g., U.S. EPA/NOAA (CAMEO tools), the CDC's Emergency Preparedness and Response Web site and NIOSH Emergency Response Safety and Health Database (ERSH-DB), the chemical industry's CHEMTREC service, poison control centers, etc. Like NIH's WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) and REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management), CHEMM is available on the Internet for online use on computers and handheld devices, and also for download so that it can be used in an emergency even without an Internet connection. A Smartphone app for CHEMM is also under development.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT<br />The contractor shall work with CHEMM subject matter experts and the NLM COTR to perform tasks associated with data extraction from source reference materials approved by NLM to enhance and update topical pages for the CHEMM Website. In addition, the contractor shall conduct quality control (technical accuracy of CHEMM information extracted/summarized from other sources) and editing checks on the content of the<br />CHEMM Website.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also select references and Web links to Internet resources for use in CHEMM based on NLM-provided selection criteria and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>Task 1. Create new content for CHEMM in easy Web-readable style, by extracting/summarizing data from NLM approved reference materials. The content should be written for easily readable style for the Web.</p>
<p>Contractor will submit on average one new content item per month. The average word count of such content is 500 words per item. The file format for delivery is customarily in Word format. Traditionally, the contractor has delivered the new content via email and email attachments.</p>
<p>Once a new content item is assigned to the contractor, typically the contractor will be required to submit the first draft in about 20 work days. Normally, there will be only one submission of a revised draft and it is due within about 10 working days. Typically, the contractor will have 5 working days to finalize the draft revision.</p>
<p>Task 2. Enhance, update, and revise current topical content.</p>
<p>Task 3. Select references and Web links to Internet resources for inclusion in CHEMM Website, and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>NLM-approved reference materials will be selected by the Library's subject matter experts. The contractor will typically have direct access via web site links to the NLM-approved reference materials. Sometimes, the contractor will receive printed copies of the reference materials and/or will rarely need to go to the local library for a printed copy.</p>
<p>Task 4. Support content building activities such as facilitating peer consultation and peer review meetings, pending on availability of funding</p>
<p>508 COMPLIANCE<br />THE&nbsp;SECTION ON&nbsp;508 COMPLIANCE&nbsp;PERTAINS ONLY TO THE MONTHLY&nbsp;REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK.<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. The CHEMM data must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:<br /><br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support<br />(Only complete this portion of the attached GPAT.)</p>
<p>These provisions can be found at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm<br /><br />Section 508 Program Need<br />Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: content for CHEMM website.<br /><br />Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Section 508 Evaluation Factors<br />Responses to the solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.<br /><br />Section 508 Acceptance Criteria<br />The web site design project deliverables as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The proposals for the CHEMM project must include a GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of the solicitation.<br />All resulting electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will become the property of the Government.<br />The electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />After satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility, the evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the perspective vendors to meet the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work. Prospective vendors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate based on the stated criteria. <br /><br />Content and technical factors are of paramount consideration; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Offeror(s) provide the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated Offeror(s). Offeror(s) are advised that award will be made to that Offeror(s) whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Agency's best value determination includes assessments by reviewers with a thorough knowledge of the CHEMM program to evaluate each quote&nbsp;based on the response to the evaluation criteria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Quoters are advised that each quotation may be subjected to a price analysis, as determined to be appropriate by the Government.</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:<br /><br />Criterion A: Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach (40 points)<br />The contractor shall provide a written proposal demonstrating an understanding of the purpose and intent of the task order requirements through a comprehensive description of the proposed approach; and describe procedures to ensure that the project timeline will be met. The proposal demonstrates sufficient contractor experience and knowledge to assure rapid execution of tasks. All proposed staff shall be approved by the SIS Project Officer to ensure that skills and experience are sufficient for the requirements of specific, assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Criterion B: Corporate Experience and Personnel (35 points)<br />This criterion will be evaluated based on the description of the organization, personnel and project experience. The proposal should include a detailed description of the organization. The experience of the personnel should be outlined. Detailed information describing the facilities and resources the organization has to carry out the tasks of the project should also be included. Proposals must provide an explanation of how the corporation will allocate overall resources to this project, and an identification of a clear line of responsibility for the project. Corporate experience will be evaluated based upon the offeror's prior experience with similar activities. Proposed personnel shall be evaluated on their demonstrated, documented and relevant expertise, education availability and experience.</p>
<p>Criterion C: Past Performance (25 points)<br />The government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of high quality products and services.</p>
<p>a) Offerors shall submit a list and description of the last five relevant contracts that are similar to this type of requirement (i.e. IT effort) completed during the past three years and all contracts currently in process. Offerors shall be evaluated on (1) record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; (2) adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; (3) reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and deep commitment satisfaction; and (4) business-like concern for the interests of the customer.<br /><br />b) For each contract/subcontract identified, include a brief synopsis which includes the date the work was performed, the client for whom the work was performed (include client name and telephone number), and a description of work performed. The vendor is authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contract/subcontract and the vendor's corrective actions, if necessary.<br /><br />PROPOSAL SUBMISSION<br />The proposal should not be more than 10 pages. The page count does not include the cover letter, table of contents, executive summary or appendix. The past performance documentation will also not account against the page count.</p>
<p>Please email an electronic copy of your proposal to pringlek@mail.nih.gov. The subject line should read CHEMM Proposal and may include the solicitation number. The electronic copy should be received by 12 noon local prevailing time on Friday, June 22, 2012. Also, send one original and 3 copies of the proposal for evaluation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the April 2012 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-58. This acquisition is a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541690. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. This is a labor hour contract.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM), Specialized Information Services (SIS) has a requirement to create new content, enhance existing content, and procure support for content building activities for the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) Website. The award will be for a Base Year with options for two (2) successive one-year periods. The CHEMM tool is designed to provide access to comprehensive sets of information via a user-friendly interface. The users include first responders, first receivers, other health care providers, and planners. CHEMM allows these users to plan, respond, recover, and mitigate the effects of incidents involving chemicals. CHEMM's unique content covers information especially relevant to chemical exposure-related mass casualty and "unusual" scenarios. CHEMM's expert interface will link users to resources from other organizations, e.g., U.S. EPA/NOAA (CAMEO tools), the CDC's Emergency Preparedness and Response Web site and NIOSH Emergency Response Safety and Health Database (ERSH-DB), the chemical industry's CHEMTREC service, poison control centers, etc. Like NIH's WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) and REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management), CHEMM is available on the Internet for online use on computers and handheld devices, and also for download so that it can be used in an emergency even without an Internet connection. A Smartphone app for CHEMM is also under development.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT<br />The contractor shall work with CHEMM subject matter experts and the NLM COTR to perform tasks associated with data extraction from source reference materials approved by NLM to enhance and update topical pages for the CHEMM Website. In addition, the contractor shall conduct quality control (technical accuracy of CHEMM information extracted/summarized from other sources) and editing checks on the content of the<br />CHEMM Website.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also select references and Web links to Internet resources for use in CHEMM based on NLM-provided selection criteria and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>Task 1. Create new content for CHEMM in easy Web-readable style, by extracting/summarizing data from NLM approved reference materials. The content should be written for easily readable style for the Web.</p>
<p>Contractor will submit on average one new content item per month. The average word count of such content is 500 words per item. The file format for delivery is customarily in Word format. Traditionally, the contractor has delivered the new content via email and email attachments.</p>
<p>Once a new content item is assigned to the contractor, typically the contractor will be required to submit the first draft in about 20 work days. Normally, there will be only one submission of a revised draft and it is due within about 10 working days. Typically, the contractor will have 5 working days to finalize the draft revision.</p>
<p>Task 2. Enhance, update, and revise current topical content.</p>
<p>Task 3. Select references and Web links to Internet resources for inclusion in CHEMM Website, and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>NLM-approved reference materials will be selected by the Library's subject matter experts. The contractor will typically have direct access via web site links to the NLM-approved reference materials. Sometimes, the contractor will receive printed copies of the reference materials and/or will rarely need to go to the local library for a printed copy.</p>
<p>Task 4. Support content building activities such as facilitating peer consultation and peer review meetings, pending on availability of funding</p>
<p>508 COMPLIANCE<br />THE&nbsp;SECTION ON&nbsp;508 COMPLIANCE&nbsp;PERTAINS ONLY TO THE MONTHLY&nbsp;REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK.<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. The CHEMM data must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:<br /><br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support<br />(Only complete this portion of the attached GPAT.)</p>
<p>These provisions can be found at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm<br /><br />Section 508 Program Need<br />Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: content for CHEMM website.<br /><br />Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Section 508 Evaluation Factors<br />Responses to the solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.<br /><br />Section 508 Acceptance Criteria<br />The web site design project deliverables as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The proposals for the CHEMM project must include a GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of the solicitation.<br />All resulting electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will become the property of the Government.<br />The electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />After satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility, the evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the perspective vendors to meet the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work. Prospective vendors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate based on the stated criteria. <br /><br />Content and technical factors are of paramount consideration; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost.

<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:<br /><br />Criterion A: Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach (40 points)<br />The contractor shall provide a written proposal demonstrating an understanding of the purpose and intent of the task order requirements through a comprehensive description of the proposed approach; and describe procedures to ensure that the project timeline will be met. The proposal demonstrates sufficient contractor experience and knowledge to assure rapid execution of tasks. All proposed staff shall be approved by the SIS Project Officer to ensure that skills and experience are sufficient for the requirements of specific, assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Criterion B: Corporate Experience and Personnel (35 points)<br />This criterion will be evaluated based on the description of the organization, personnel and project experience.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the previous presolicitation notice is to publish the answers to questions received concerning this solicitation and to change the "Response Date" to July 10, 2012 @ 2:00 p.m. All other terms and conditions remain the same.
1.	The "Response Date" on FBO calls for proposals to be due June 15 however the SF 1449 block 8 provides a due date of 7-10-2012. Can we assume that the correct proposal due date is July 10 and not June 15? July 10, 2012

2.	Following up from the prior question, specifically if the due date is June 15 - The solicitation mentions that electronic submission is acceptable but that 1 hard copy must be mailed. If the due date is June 15, may we submit the hard copy so that it is received by the VA by Monday and not Friday? July 10, 2012

3.	Must we provide resumes of our proposed personnel at the time of proposal submission or may we include simple bios of each candidate with resumes to follow post-award?  Bios are probably fine for the proposal submission time.

4.	Is there a specific technology the VA has in mind when implementing this training, i.e., Flash v. HTML 5?  While HTML 5 is the future platform of eLearning projects, the technology is not readily accessible on most older internet browsers and may prove problematic for the government specifically.  With that in mind, can we use Flash technology, assuming 508 compliance.  As long as the technology is compatible with the VA's requirements, we don't have any additional specific needs

5.	For the creation of the videos described in Task Three, is it expected that we will bring our video production crew/equipment (camera, green screen, lighting, microphones) to the VA for recording?   Yes

6.	I want to confirm that the work is permitted to take place on our (the contractor's) site so that we can leverage our own e-Learning development software. Is that acceptable? Yes

7.	Are teleconferences acceptable for all required briefings and status reports?  Yes

8.	Given that design can be as minimal or as extensive as is desired (and obviously the design will affect cost and conversely, overall user experience) can the VA provide some sort of estimate as to what they would deem reasonable in terms of total project cost?   No. We recognize that the parameters provided here are broad, in part because a core part of the work will be to select strategies/activities that will appropriately convey the content of the training.  The specific strategies and activities will ultimately be used will be decided in discussions between VA and the contractor.  Because of this, applicants may wish to provide a range of cost estimates, reflecting the costs associated with a simple implementation of the training, the costs associated with developing a more complex version, and the costs associated with a most complex version.  The final product must be, at a minimum, a 30-45 minute interactive, web-based course that includes at least 1 video footage component or other audiovisual content.  As noted below, the contractor is also required to provide VA with 10 stock photos.
All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC><br />Introduction
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 334516 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods, noninvasive physiological studies, and minimally invasive interventional procedures. This work has included some of the first demonstrations of functional brain imaging, discovery of magnetization transfer contrast in NMR experiments, development and validation of new MR imaging methods, use of NMR and optical spectroscopy to study in vivo physiology, invention of novel two photon optical microscopy methods, and study of some of the first uses of MRI to guide intravascular catheter-based procedures and robotic surgery. The NHLBI Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory, one of the intramural research laboratories within NHLBI, is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from subcellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions.</p>
<p>Computed Tomography (CT) is an x-ray based technology that produces noninvasive cross-sectional images of the body. The advent of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners enabled acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional images of the body when married with helical scan methods. The value of the resulting high resolution images has been recognized by many groups around the world as providing high enough resolution images to diagnose coronary artery stenosis in patients. This methodology is useful in a wide range of cardiovascular applications including noninvasive angiography, imaging heart valves and the pericardium. One disadvantage of current a generation MDCT scanner is the limited spatial coverage of the detectors. Typically, 64-detector scanners cover 4 or less cm along the axial direction of the body. To produce the highest quality images of the body, helical scanning modes are used which frequently use 80% overlap between each rotation to guarantee adequate spatial coverage and minimize image artifacts. This increases radiation exposure and reduces temporal efficiency.</p>
<p>Computed Tomography has been recognized as a large fraction of medical radiation exposure. The Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory has a strong clinical and research interest in developing and optimizing radiation reduction techniques.<br />Mandatory Specifications</p>
<p>1. The instrument must be a detector capable of acquiring 320 rows of data simultaneously at 0.5 mm detector width thickness for reconstruction into 3-dimensional CT images of the body whereby 15cm of the body can be imaged in one rotation around the body.<br />2. The range shall be large enough to cover many organs such as the brain and the heart within one rotation of the scanner.<br />3. Gantry rotation time is specified to be at least: 350ms indicating that cardiac images can be obtained within one rotation. The gantry bore diameter is specified to be at least 72 cm.<br />4. Helical scanning mode should support up to 160 simultaneous detector rows of acquisition. Due to the complexities of the CT datasets, image reconstruction speeds of 50 images per second are required.</p>
<p>MDCT Scanner Specifications</p>
<p>1. The system will include all hardware and software necessary to acquire and reconstruct images for a wide range of applications including but not limited to coronary calcium, contrast enhanced CT coronary angiography, angiography of other blood vessels, chest, brain, body, and other general CT applications. <br />2. The CT scanner shall be capable of cardiovascular imaging including single heartbeat scans, sub-mSv coronary CT angiography, iterative reconstruction image processing methods, and a fluoroscopy mode. <br />3. The basic MDCT system shall include all hardware needed to trigger acquisitions from an ECG. <br />4. The system should also include a scanner table which can be used to move the patient in and out of the scanner. <br />5. The contractor shall include an operator console, image reconstruction computers, and 3 post-processing/image review workstations.</p>
<p>Capability Statement</p>
<p>Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer. The capabilities statement should include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientists, medical experts, and technical personnel as it relates to the above outlined requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) an outline of previous research projects in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated, and 5) any other information considered relevant to this program. The capability statement must not exceed 10 single sided or 5 double sided pages in length and using a 12-point font size minimum.</p>
<p>Interested small business organizations are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone numbers of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Rashida Ferebee, Contract Specialist, at ferebebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After review of the responses received, pre-solicitation and solicitation notices may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation. The solicitation release date is pending. The Government intends to negotiate one (1) Firm-Fixed Price with an approximate award date of October 29, 2012. The proposed delivery date will be negotiated.</p>
<p>No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>Biology- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District (NYD) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to award two IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity) contracts for its Operations Division. One contract would be UNRESTRICTED, and the other contract would be 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The IDIQ contracts would consist of the sampling and testing of dredged material following procedures described in the 1992 NYD/EPA Region 2 Regional Testing Manual on Dredged Material Proposed for Ocean Disposal (RTM) (http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/business/buslinks/contract/pdf/guidance.pdf), the 1991 Green Book (www.epa.gov/OWOW/oceans/gbook/index.html), and subsequent updates to these two documents. Task orders would include all or some of the following: sediment and water collection (on contractor supplied ship); sample handling, processing and shipping; physical and biological analyses (e.g., toxicity and bioaccumulation testing and physical analyses); QA/QC procedures, and necessary corrective actions. Reports containing the sampling logs, all testing results and QA/QC information in a format required by the New York District Corps of Engineers would have to be provided by the contractor for each task order. All sampling would be performed within the Port of New York &amp; New Jersey, the length of the Hudson River, in the Atlantic Ocean at the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) and its Reference Site, and in Long Island Sound at the Western and/or Central Disposal Sites. A detailed description of work required for these contracts will be provided in its entirety upon issuance of the complete solicitation. Prior to issuance of the solicitation, it is highly recommended that interested parties read both the Green Book and the RTM in order to obtain a thorough understanding of the work required in the NYD/EPA, Region 2 dredged material testing program, including procedures for satisfying Demonstration of Capability (DOC) requirements. <br /><br />The duration of the contracts is one year plus four optional years. One Small Business Set-Aside contract will be awarded to the lowest bidder who has currently (within the last 18 months) demonstrated to NYD and EPA Region 2, through submission of actual data, that they are capable of performing work in our program. A bidder will be considered to have demonstrated they are capable if there is documentation in the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing progam (within the last 18 months) stating that the laboratory has submitted data that is fully acceptable or acceptable with qualification, or that they have satisfied DOC requirements for the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing program. This contract will be up to $1,300,000 for the base year and up to $1,000,000 for each of the four option years.<br /><br />A second contract will be awarded on an Unrestricted basis to the next lowest bidder (or to the lowest bidder, if the next lowest bidder was awarded the contract described above). If this bidder has not satisfied DOC requirements for the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing program, they will have up to one year to obtain a statement from the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing program indicating that they have submitted data (in the form of either actual project data for evaluation in our program or through the DOC process) that is fully acceptable or acceptable with qualification, or that they have satisfied DOC requirements for the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing program. This contract will be up to $700,000 for the base year and up to $1,000,000 for each of the four option years. If the contractor does not receive a statement indicating that they have submitted data (in the form of either actual project data for evaluation in our program or through the DOC process) that is fully acceptable or acceptable with qualification, or that they have satisfied DOC requirements for the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing program, they will be paid only the minimum guarantee of $14,000 and the option years will not be exercised.<br /><br />Individual task orders will be awarded based on several criteria including cost for required analyses, laboratory capacity/availability for the required amount of work, the type of project requiring testing, and the satisfactory and timely completion of previous task orders for performing work for the NYD/EPA Region 2 dredged material testing program.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380. The business size standard is $12,000,000. The SIC CODE is 1542. The estimated cost range for this project is between $ 5-10 Million.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration: <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities.<br /><br />The final FY12 SOF Experimentation focus area will be conducted on 31 Jul-10 Aug 2012 with the theme being Mobility and Vehicle Protection at Camp Roberts, CA.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation focus areas for FY13 tri-annual TNT events are as follows:<br />- 30 Oct - 8 Nov 2012: Urban Operations at Camp Atterbury / Muscatatuck UTC, IN<br />- 26 Feb - 7 Mar 2013: Digital Soldier at Avon Park, FL<br />- 18-27 Jun 2013: Signature Reduction at Camp Roberts, CA</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 75 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts TNT experimentation events in cooperation with NPS at Camp Atterbury / Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Camp Roberts, CA; and at Avon Park, FL. These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. TNT identifies potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater for the purpose of TNT. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 31 Jul-10 Aug 2012, at Camp Roberts, CA. The venue will explore emerging technology solutions for: Mobility and Vehicle Protection. Technology will need to be capable of supporting a SOF unit to provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF small units' vehicle mobility and/or protection. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL-3) or greater. Any and all solutions must provide all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. Mobility and vehicle protection systems may include enhancements to armor, survivability, mobility or C4ISR solutions for new vehicles or existing Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV): Individual - All Terrain Vehicle (ATV); Light - Light Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV); Medium - Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV); Commercial - Non-Standard Commercial Vehicles (NSCV); and Heavy - MRAP RG-31, RG-33, RG 33 AUV and M-ATV. USSOCOM's interest remains all types of vehicular armor, including opaque, flat transparent, curved transparent, and armor for all platforms (ground, rotary wing, fixed wing, and maritime). Flat and curved transparent armor that is lightweight and thin continues to be a high priority. Advanced technologies supporting mobility solutions for amphibious vehicles, silent, hybrid or increased efficiency propulsion are also of interest.</p>
<p>3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation nominations.</p>
<p>4. Respondents interested in live fire experiments shall conduct and submit a safety risk assessment. The risk assessment shall address the likelihood and severity of any inherent risks as well as risk mitigation measures required to bring the resultant risk to a low level. The risk assessment shall be submitted as an attachment to the experiment nomination. Reference MIL-STD-882D for instructions and information regarding risk assessments. Also, respondents are responsible for ammunition shipments to include an Interim Hazard Classification and coordination for receipt and storage at Camp Roberts.</p>
<p>5. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATIONS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATION SUBMITTALS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED WITHIN A 30 DAY SUBMISSION PERIOD DEFINED AS 75-45 DAYS PRIOR TO EACH SPECIFIED TNT EVENT. For the August TNT at Camp Roberts, CA, all submissions must be received no later than&nbsp;18 June 2012. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for FY13 TNT events. Vehicles currently in consideration for the Ground Mobility Vehicle 1.1 Solicitation will not be considered for this experimentation event.</p>
<p>C. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br />Technology Experimentation nominations shall be submitted electronically via USSOCOM webpage: http://1.usa.gov/TNTExpNom. Multiple nominations addressing different technology experiments may be submitted by each respondent. Submissions will be reviewed by USSOCOM personnel, support contractors, or NPS Faculty, Staff, or students. Each technology experiment nomination must address only one experiment.<br />Select respondents will be invited to participate in USSOCOM experiments. USSOCOM shall provide venues, supporting infrastructure, and assessment (operational and technical, based on availability of resources and written request) personnel at no cost to invited respondent(s). Respondent's travel costs and technology experiments will be at the respondent's expense. The TNT venue will only supply basic venue infrastructure including frequency allocation and portable power. Invited respondents should prepare to be self-sufficient during experimentation and not dependent on venue resources for success.<br />D. BASIS FOR SELECTION TO PARTICIPATE:<br />Selection of respondents to participate will be based on the extent to which the technology represents a particular class or level of capability that can be provided to Special Operations Forces. <br />Other considerations include:<br />- Technical maturity<br />- Relevance of or adaptability to military operations/missions<br />- Relevance to current operational needs<br />- Relevant to Event Focus Area<br />E. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: All efforts shall be made to protect proprietary information that is clearly marked in writing. Lessons learned by USSOCOM from these experiments may be broadly disseminated but only within the Government. If selected for participation in TNT experimentation, vendors may be requested to provide additional information that will be used in preparation for the experiments.<br />F. USE OF INFORMATION: The purpose of this notice is to gain information leading to Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities and to assist in accelerating the delivery of these capabilities to the warrior. All proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish future capability and requirements.</p>
<p>G. SPECIAL NOTICE: Respondent's attention is directed to the fact that Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) or contractor consultant/advisors to the Government will review and provide support during evaluation of submittals. When appropriate, non-Government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with procurement Integrity Laws and shall sign non-disclosure and rules of conduct/conflict of interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submission in response to this RFI constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government support contractors.</p>

STE 160, BLACK DIAMOND, WA 98010 US
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">STATEMENT OF WORK: The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Division of Housing, Mission and Goals (DHMG) has a need to develop simulation models that jointly encompass interest rates, inflation, house prices, and unemployment. These new models will be combined with existing behavioral models (e.g., prepayment and default models) to enable mortgage valuation and risk management capabilities. Some examples of the capabilities desired are the ability to test the sensitivity of guarantee fees to various assumptions, and the specification and computation of credit risk metrics. This development will support the Agency's mission to analyze and quantify the risks that its regulated entities engage in, and could potentially be shared in the future with other regulators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To support this goal, software is required that will enable the development of these models. The software needs to be flexible enough to accommodate the research agenda and potential future projects the Agency may consider. To facilitate these needs, the software, at a minimum, shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide a general mathematical programming environment that is exceptionally fast, providing performance comparable to compiled C or FORTRAN programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide optimization capability (both unconstrained and constrained optimization and maximum likelihood). For optimization, it is required that the software solve the Nonlinear Programming problem, subject to general constraints on the parameters - linear or nonlinear, equality or inequality, using the Sequential Quadratic Programming method in combination with several descent methods selectable by the user. For estimation using maximum likelihood, it is required that the software solves the general maximum likelihood problem subject to linear or nonlinear and equality or inequality parameter constraints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide the following discrete choice models: Nested logit model, Conditional logit model, Multinomial logit model, Adjacent category multinomial logit model, Stereotype multinomial logit model, Poisson regression (left or right truncated, left or right censored, or zero-inflated models), Negative binomial regression (left or right truncated, left or right censored, or zero-inflated models), Logit and probit models, Ordered logit and probit models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide financial time series analysis capability, including the following univariate GARCH models (ARCH, GARCH, IGARCH, FIGARCH, and EGARCH).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide multivariate models at least including capability to estimate models characterized by conditional constant correlation, dynamic conditional correlation, FI dynamic conditional correlation, and exponential (Exp) dynamic conditional correlation. This is an especially important requirement to address the correlation assumptions in the simulation model development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide multivariate time series capabilities, including: Least Squares Dummy Variable model for multivariate data with bias correction of the parameters, Hamilton's Regime-Switching Regression model, Seasonal VARMAX model: SVARMAX(p,d,q,P,D,Q)s, and also Time Series Cross-Sectional Regression models. This extensive multivariate capability is an important requirement.</p>

<DESC>AWARD NOTICE: BOA VA263-12-A-0104 has been awarded to GGNSC Ipswich, SD, for Nursing Home Services for period 6/1/2012 - 5/31/2013 +4 Option Years.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation VA-263-12-Q-0555 is being issued as an unrestricted Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement and services of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Ipswich, South Dakota, for a Base Year period 06/1/2012 â€“ 5/31/2013 with four (4) Option Years.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Governmentâ€™s minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  Facility must have and maintain the South Dakota Department of Health Nursing Facility License.
STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patientâ€™s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteranâ€™s care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (Â§5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing homeâ€™s Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patientâ€™s stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAâ€™s request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements â€“ All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VAâ€™s quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VAâ€™s on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractorâ€™s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctorâ€™s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications â€“ on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteranâ€™s/familiesâ€™ expense.

This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications â€“ on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteranâ€™s/familiesâ€™ expense.
