FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Digital Linear Tape (DLT) is one of several technologies developed to increase data transfer rates and storage capacities of computer tape drives. SDLT, an upgraded variant of DLT technology, makes it possible to store more than 100 GB on a single cartridge with data transfer speeds of up to 10 MB per second.  SDLT drives are currently deployed to posts.    The SDLT 160/320 is the second tape drive released in the SDLT family, offering a 45% increase in native storage capacity and performance as compared to the SDLT 110/220 GB tape drive. With its improvements in capacity and performance, the SDLT 160/320 GB tape drive is positioned as the fastest and highest capacity tape drive in the mid-range drive segment. Backward read compatible with DLT Type IV media, the SDLT 160/320 maintains the SDLT compatibility standards introduced on the SDLT 110/220 while adding read compatibility for media written in the DLT1 and DLT VS 40/80 format. SDLT 160/320 GB Tape Drive Customer benefits include: ý	160 GB per cartridge capacity requires fewer data cartridges for backups, reducing the customers total cost of ownership ý	57.6 GB/hour performance reduces the customers backup window by 33% or more as compared to other competitive technologies ý	Investment protection through backward-read compatibility with previously written DLT Type IV and SDLT media ý	Increased reliability and performance through technological advances in drive head and media design ý	Reduces dependence on spares inventory with a 24-hour exchange ý	SDLT technology roadmap offers future capacities beyond 1TB per cartridge<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. CA/CST has selected the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Tape Drive because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý tape drives indicated that this is the only tape drive that meets the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested SDLT tape drives will be deployed at overseas posts which has established an environment comprised of equipment that is compatible with the Quantum SDLT 320 tape drive.  The continued use of the SDLT tape drive eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturersý server configurations. Most importantly, the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Drive is currently the only tape drive available that meets CAýs requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive without delay.<BR><BR>

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: ý	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  ý	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. ý	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. ý	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsý Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-4340C Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner to support Consular posts overseas.  The Fujitsu fi-4340C is a high-speed color capable scanner with top speed of 40 sheets per minute or 80 (when scanning both sides of each sheet) page images per minute.   It operates at approximately twice the speed of the previously reviewed fi-4220C.  The product complies and is able to operate within Consular Affairs (CA) Modernized Systems architecture.  This scanner meets specific requirements for CA Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) applications.  It is also suitable for use with other CA applications.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Fujitsu FI-4340C Scanners without delay. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. The choice to use the FI-4340C as opposed to other document scanners available is that CA/CST/CS has acquired and fielded several hundred of these scanners since its inception in 2002.  The FI-4340C offers more features and is more robust than other scanners in this price range.  The continued use of Fujitsu scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  Furthermore, no additional training to those handling the scanner is necessary with the continued use of this scanner.   In addition, the document scanners require customized software.  Because the proprietary Consular applications (NIV, IVO, ACS+, and INK) have been developed to work with this specific document scanner, it is most cost effective to continue to use the Fujitsu FI-4340C rather than introduce another manufacturerýs product.  Another manufacturerýs product will require redesigning the CA applications.  CA/CST has selected the Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsý Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for three courses entitled ?MATLAB Fundamentals Programming Techniques", "Advanced MATLAB Programming Techniques", and "Simulink for Dynamic System Modeling?.  This training shall include both an introduction and advanced look at the MATLAB technical computing environment for aerospace engineers; themes of data analysis; visualization, modeling, and programming; algorithm modeling and design validation; and application of basic modeling techniques and tools for developing Simulink block diagrams. The vendor shall be responsible for providing all training materials to include software and any training books or workbooks necessary for the course.  The vendor shall conduct a five day session; two days to cover MATLAB Fundamentals & Programming Techniques for Aerospace Applications, one day to cover Advanced MATLAB Programming Techniques, and two days to cover Simulink for Dynamic System Modeling. Training shall be conducted at NASA?s Dryden Flight Research Center on April 14-18, 2008. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the training course from The Mathworks, Inc. 3 Apple Hill Dr, Natick, MA 01760.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) These are existing courses that meet the requirements of NASA without need for modification; 2) The vendor developed the MATLAB and Simulink software products and through that knowledge and proprietary data is able to provide expert training utilizing current staff; 3) The vendor?s expertise and many years of hands-on experience at NASA provides for cost-effective, timely, specialized training that can not be readily duplicated by any other source within the timelines required. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 24, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Megan Willis at Megan.M.Willis@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Last year, the first Large Tactical Sensor Networks (LTSN) BAA 06-015 was issued with seven product areas. To continue the development of new technologies under this program, this second BAA having five product areas will highlight specific technologies for development. The goal of the Large Tactical Sensor Networks program is to develop and demonstrate measurable advances to enable sensor networks of unmanned vehicles and unattended ground sensors to rapidly respond to small unit intelligence requirements, automatically sense the tactical environment and perform automated translation, fusion, and dissemination of sensor data into actionable intelligence.  This will be accomplished through technology development and algorithms that can directly support expeditionary warfighting forces in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  Large Tactical Sensor Networks are envisioned to operate in a net centric environment  providing support to expeditionary forces to carry out the warfighting philosophies of the Marine Corps , Special Operations, and the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC).  ONR seeks both to automate processes that provide small tactical units with an automated understanding of relationships among battlespace objects and events and to automate management of multiple hypotheses about the intent of these objects and groupings.  Data analysis and fusion algorithms resulting from this research will be integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs and Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).   Sensor network management and human interface technologies will also be designed to be integrated with relevant naval unmanned vehicle systems such as the Marine Corps Tier II UAV.

The Government has purchased one half block in the Central Business District (CBD) of the City of Chicago adjacent to the Mies van der Rohe designed Federal Center.  Quincy court is directly in the middle of the block, east of the E. M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse and flanked by 230 S. State Street and 220 S. State Street. The result of this construction project will create a portal or entrance way to Quincy Court that will visually identify it as Government property.  The project consist of removing above and below grade site improvements, erection of a steel and formed resin canopy structure, new paving, installation of hardened resign tables and benches, and installation of lighting elements throughout the project area.

Work for this project is expected to begin in June 2008. A qualified contractor will be selected using a best-value source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.

Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned and service disabled veteran-owned businesses are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.

We strongly encourage the participation of local construction contractors as knowledge of the area could enhance the quality of the project.

Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort.

The contractor shall supply the necessary test support equipment to perform on-site maintenance on the EOID subsystem.  This procurement is sole source because Aret?

Use of another company to repair the EOID may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an accurate EOID could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels as well as the entire AN/AQS-20A system.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to Aret? Associates immediately. The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-08-T-3515.

An additional requirement exists to take the AWE software that JTE is currently developing and migrate it to the H-1 UPC. As a result, the Government requires JTE to modify the current UPC and AWE baselines to obtain concurrent updates for multiple other AWE and UPC baselines in order to implement Fleet-user Functionality.  The IDIQ max quantity is four SCS's including Cobra 4.0. SCS 5, SCS 6, and SCS 7.0.  Delivery will be 18-24 months as specified in individual delivery orders.   The contract will have an ordering period of 4 years.  This requirement is limited to JTE because they are still in the process of developing the technical data to meet the requirements and functionality of the original baseline, the Cobra 3.0 UPC and SCS 4.0 AWE.  This data, while being developed, will be modified/updated in order to address the new requirements for Cobra 4.0, 5.0 AWE, 6.0 UPC and 7.0 UPC.  As a result, any anomalies found in the current baseline must be incorporated concurrently in the remaining SCSs quickly in order to maintain program schedules.   Place of Performance is expected to be Niceville, FL.  Any firm believing that they can provide the needed updates without substantial duplication of cost, and within the needed time frame may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 20 March 2008.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.   Award of this contract is expected on or about 15 May 2008.  All requests must reference the solicitation number N68936-08-R-0020.  Please submit responses in writing to Gary Trimble by email at gary.trimble@navy.mil or by mail to:  Commander Code 210000D, NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (NASA/DFRC) plans to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to L-3 Communications Corporation (L-3 Comm.) of Salt Lake City, UT to provide specialized engineering and product support for the communication systems to the Global Hawk aircraft. The objective of the NASA DFRC Global Hawk Project is to provide a unique national civilian capability to fly government and civilian organization airborne science payloads on high-altitude, over-the-horizon, and long-duration missions.  The contractor will be required to provide communication system engineering and technical support for the Global Hawk aircraft systems. The Contractor will be responsible for training and employing their specific unique facilities, tooling, and/or drawings used in the aircraft?s communication systems design and manufacture to perform modification or repair of the existing equipment. In addition, the Contractor will perform analysis, design, test, manufacturing, and installation support for anticipated Global Hawk communication system additions or modifications.  The Contractor will also be responsible for fabricating additional Global Hawk airborne and ground communications equipment for use as spares by NASA-DFRC in support of uninterrupted Global Hawk flight operations. L-3 Communication Corporation is the sole manufacturer and system integrator for the proprietary Global Hawk aircraft communications equipment, which has unique knowledge of the ACTD Global Hawk aircraft and associated airborne and ground communication systems.  L-3 Comm. designed, built, and extensively tested the communications systems for the Global Hawk family of aircraft and associated ground and aircraft systems.  L-3 Comm. possesses the detailed knowledge for all aspects of the vehicle and ground station communications systems.  L-3 Comm. can provide instant response to resolve problems and assistance with the communications systems that support the missions required for these experiments.  Awarding to any other source would result in a significant schedule risk due to L-3 Comm.?s engineering and manufacturing expertise and capabilities with the Global Hawk family of unpiloted aircraft.  This expertise is critical to the successful implementation of DFRC?s airborne science mission supported by Global Hawk type aircraft. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 p.m. local time on March 24, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Sole-Source basis for the purchase of items listed in the Description of Supplies.     This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.

The NAICS Code is 443112; size standard $8 million.

Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.     A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be in accordance with the Description of Supplies: 

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:     

Sound Distributors, Inc. has been the sole provider of services and equipment for the Officer?s Club Audio System.  They are familiar with the facilities, the idiosyncrasies involved, and the configuration of current systems utilized at the Officer?s Club and Enlisted Club.  

The standardization of systems between the clubs are a huge benefit in terms of personnel training requirements and preventive measures used to avoid damages that may be caused by equipment failure, technical problems, or operator error.  

It  is cost prohibitive to reprocure new audio systems for all locations affected by this upgrade.  In addition, acquiring an upgrade from a different vendor would negate existing warranties, complicate systems configuration, and possibly introduce technical problems.



CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.     Evaluation procedures in FAR Part 13.106-2 will be utilized.     

Interested parties capable of providing the above must submit a written price quote to include discount terms, Cage Code, DUNS number, and Tax Identification Number.     

To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this solicitation, contractor must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, NO EXCEPTIONS.     To register, visit http://www.ccr.gov.           

Responses to this notice shall be provided in writing via email to:

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis with Cascade Microtech, Incorporated, of Beaverton, Oregon, for the acquisition of a Probe Station to be used by the Ceramics Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

*****Sole source determination is based on the need to duplicate, with a latest-generation tool, a probe station that is identical to the one currently in the NIST laboratory.  Cascade Microtech, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide a probe station that meets the following requirements:
1) The system allows all LCR meters to be calibrated one time for all positions of the chuck for multiple touch downs of a probe; 2) The system allows full control of the prober and positioners without opening the enclosure thus insuring frost-free thermal measurements.  It also allows the user to fully control the internal environment of the chamber, take measurements and manipulate the measurement tools without causing disruption of the test application typically brought on by external noises from such sources as motors, thermal electronics, etc; 3) The integrated auxiliary chuck assembly that allows the user a supplementary location to affix probe calibration and cleaning tools independent of the primary chuck surface. 4) The system allows for simultaneous full semi-automatic and manual control; 5) The system allows for femtoAmp measurement level within milli-seconds after a stage move (typical cable greater than 5 seconds hold off after 1mm move to reach less than 1 picoAmp; 6) The system shielding process that offer less than -150dbV noise level on the chuck surface thus allowing for full measurement at the minimum oscillator level range of the Agilent E4980A.  Cascade has developed these features and are both proprietary and patented.  Therefore, Cascade Microtech, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required probe station.  Cascade Microtech, Incorporated, is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required probe station. 

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CAS, Inc Huntsville, Alabama, for an increase to the ceiling on the current CAS Contract W9113M-05-C-0134.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 23 04 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support the continuation of current efforts relating to the Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) Requirements Scientific, Engineering and Technical Assistanc e (SETA) and Logistics Support .  Award to any source other than CAS would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The ceiling increase will support the executi on of work planned through October 2010.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is di rected toward CAS, Inc.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Elbert Clarke at elbert.clarke@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephon e inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source mod ification to Contract W9113M-05-C-0134 is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

IN ADDITION, PLEASE SUBMIT QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES TO THE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE BY E-MAIL TO THE INDIVIDUALS LISTED AS THE POINT OF CONTACT.  

THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS, ON MARCH 20, 2008.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SS) NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide an IT Security Audit of an organization/facility that will determine if that organization is in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).  The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information.  Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program.  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. The National Institute for Standards and Technology guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

Sources Sought are also required to have technical and professional understanding of requires listed in this sources sought.

History:

The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) consists of many data and reporting requirements that have been designed and developed in response to the ongoing ADP requirements of the various QIOs and other affiliated partners, such as the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC) to fulfill its contractual requirements with CMS.  This system, which became operational is May 1997, interfaces with CMS Central Office, 53 QIOs and CDAC.  Through the SDPS, the QIOs have a database of current Part A claims data, ad-hoc capability to access Part B data, access to national data sets, software tools for data analysis, report generation tools, and project information.

The Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are critical elements of the SDPS project within QualityNet.  The SDPS is administrated by CMS, and is designed to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.  The QIO network infrastructure is comprised of a national network of fifty-three (53) QIOs responsible for each U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia.  Each QIO maintains a staff of mutli-disciplinary experts in medicine, quality improvement, health information management, IT Systems Security, Statistical analysis, computer programming and operations, communications, public relations, and clerical/administrative support.  The QIO network structures are configured identically with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and are managed and supported by CMS IT support contractors.

Historically, the QIO organizations were exempt from meeting the FISMA standards.  But, with the increasing threat to Identity Theft and the OMB mandates to strengthen the security posture of the Federal Information Systems that contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), CMS can no longer accept the risk.  The QIO organizations must now move towards FISMA compliance.

The goal is to quantify and document the existing security posture of the QIO organizations from a FISMA compliance standpoint.

<DESC>Industry sources who recently responded to a sources sought synopsis regarding interest in competing for a Multiple Award Construction Contract at Hickam AFB, Hawaii (posted on FBO 11 Dec 07) should carefully read this notice.  

The Pacific Air Forces now wishes to combine the Hickam MACC and the MACC solicited by Andersen AFB, Guam, posted on FBO 11 Feb 08, into a single acquisition.  The 15 CONS at Hickam AFB Hawaii will serve as the lead agent for this acquisition.  The purpose of this notice is to determine industries interest in the combining of these two major acquisitions.  For those companies who recently expressed an interest in doing business at Hickam AFB under a MACC, please confirm whether you have a shared interest in doing business at the alternate base.  For example, if you responded to the 15 CONS notice for work at Hickam AFB, Hawaii please advise whether you are also interested in work at Andersen AFB Guam.  

Declinations of interest in one of the other locations will not adversely affect your ability to participate in these acquisitions. 

The Government anticipates the combined acquisitions not-to-exceed $200 million over a five year period, with $100 million allocated to each location.  The Government further anticipates the evaluation and award of a separate seed project for each location.  All other awardees will receive a minimum of $2500 each.

<DESC>Modification 2: Response date changed and solicitation will be issued on or after 14 Mar 2008.<BR>Please contact Dawn Hickman at Dawn.R.Hickman@nws02.usace.army.mil or 206-764-6575 for any questions regarding this project.  <BR><BR>The Seattle Distri ct Corps of Engineers has a competitive requirement for construction services on a project titled, FY08 Railroad Upgrade, Fort Lewis, <BR><BR>Washington.  The project consists of constructing a facility that provides the following: <BR><BR>1) Expansion o f the Interchange (IC) Yard in the Logistics Center, both widening and lengthening.  The design removes a total of 4 existing tracks on the <BR><BR>south side and adds 3 new tracks on both the north and south sides of the main lines, for a total of 6 new l ines, presently serving Ft. Lewis.  Total <BR><BR>additional track in the IC Yard area amounts to approximately 10,200 linear feet of track, ties and ballast as well as associated crossovers, highway grade <BR><BR>crossing and all site work associated with  the expansion of the IC Yard.  A gravel maintenance road is to be provided on both he north and south sides of the <BR><BR>IC Yard.  New exterior lighting and fencing will be provided on the most of the perimeter of the new yard.  <BR><BR>2)  To accommoda te expansion of the IC yard, East Lincoln Road and its rail crossing must be diverted and extended around the new yard.  A sweeping S-curve <BR><BR>alignment will be replicated approximately 1,200 feet east of the existing location.  The new road will in clude two 12-foot pavement sections and 4-foot <BR><BR>gravel shoulders.  Normal pavement markings and signage are included, but only crossbuck signs at the rail crossing will be provided, without additional <BR><BR>signalization.  <BR><BR>3) Construction of a new Locomotive Maintenance Facility (LMF) of approximately 5,800 square feet.  (Demolition of the existing LMF will be accomplished <BR><BR>under separate contract.)  The new enclosed facility will provide maintenance and storage space for three locom otives along with a small office/breakroom <BR><BR>space.  Approximately 800 linear feet of track, ties and ballast along with turnouts are associated with the new entrance to the LMF from the IC lead tracks. <BR><BR> Track design follows the basic BNSF de sign of 12-foot shoulders, walkway ballast and drainage ditches on either side.  The rail design also incorporates a <BR><BR>2-panel at-grade crossing on the east side of the building.  Shop equipment includes a 7.5-ton bridge crane, storage and pumps for lubricants and glycol, an <BR><BR>air compressor, welding equipment, storage shelves, and a small exterior hazardous materials storage building for lubricants and glycol.  The LMF will house <BR><BR>the following spaces: a small office area, tool/janitor a rea, bathroom with shower, electrical and communications closets, the shop area (4900 sq. ft.) with <BR><BR>a below-ground-surface maintenance pit for one locomotive space and several large overhead coiling doors.  The concrete slab is reinforced in the sh op area <BR><BR>for jacking a 120-ton locomotive.  The mechanical design incorporates high-intensity infrared heaters for the shop area and a split system, air-source heat <BR><BR>pump for the small office/break room.

<CONTACT>Dennis Campbell Contract Specialist 7022938569     dcampbell@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes only.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement to rehabilitate the Old Exhibit Building located at Hoover Dam, Nevada.  The Old Exhibit Building was originally used as a headquarters for soldiers protecting the dam during World War II, this building served as the dam's first visitor center.  It contains educational exhibits and offers a narrative overview of the Colorado River Basin highlighted through a topographical model showing the location of dams and reservoirs along the river and its tributaries. This building was completed in the 1940's and has been determined to be individually eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as well as contributing to Hoover Dam's National Historic Landmark status.  The intent of this project is to repair and clean the exterior of the building, rehabilitate the two restrooms, auditorium seating in the exhibit room, interior wall and ceiling surfaces, all doors, and do other miscellaneous tasks to return the building to as close to its original condition as possible given current and projected future use.  All work performed must follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Rehabilitation, as well as building codes, life safety, accessibility, and fire protection standards and regulations.

<DESC>Industry sources who recently responded to a sources sought synopsis regarding interest in competing for a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Andersen AFB, Guam, (posted on FBO 11 Feb 08) and a MACC at Hickam AFB, Hawaii (posted on FBO 11 Dec 07) should carefully read this notice.   Companies who did not express interest in the initial postings are also invited to respond to this sources sought synopsis.   

The Pacific Air Forces now wishes to combine the requirements for the Hickam MACC and the Andersen MACC into a single acquisition.  The 15 CONS at Hickam AFB, Hawaii, will serve as the lead agent for this acquisition.  The purpose of this notice is to determine industries interest in the combining of these two major acquisitions.  For those companies who recently expressed an interest in doing business at either location under a MACC, please confirm whether you have a shared interest in doing business at the alternate base.  For example, if you responded to the 15 CONS notice for work at Hickam AFB, Hawaii, please advise whether you are also interested in work at Andersen AFB, Guam.  If you responded to the 36 CONS notice for work at Andersen AFB, Guam, please advise whether you are also interested in work at Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  Declinations of interest in one of the other locations will not adversely affect your ability to participate in these acquisitions. 

The Government anticipates the combined acquisitions not-to-exceed $200 million over a five year period, with $100 million allocated to each location.  The Government further anticipates the evaluation and award of a separate seed project for each location.  All other awardees will receive a minimum of $2500 each.  

As general information, the MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 ? Construction, Subsection 233 ? Building Development and General Contracting ? size standard $31 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 ? Heavy Construction ? size standard $13 Million and Subsector 235 ? Special Trade Contractors ? Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades at Andersen AFB, Guam, and Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between $200,000 - $5,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to award separate contracts to service Andersen AFB and Hickam AFB, or single contracts combining service to both.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The Government anticipates awarding 3-5 contracts for coverage of Andersen AFB and 5-7 contracts for coverage at Hickam AFB.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference.   Details will be described in the RFP when issued.  This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. 

	In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your (a) interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate (b) if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small, (c) provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project.  If you did not respond to the initial sources sought, please also indicate (e) whether you are interested in working at Hickam AFB, Andersen AFB or both bases.   An actual solicitation is expected to be issued mid April 2008.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at www.eps.gov./ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the FedBizOpps website under IVL (Interested Vendor?s List). This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs. For further opportunities, you may review AF needs at http://www.selltoairforce.org. For other opportunities and information go to the small business administration web site at http://www.sba.gov., or contact our small business specialist james.watanabe@hickam.af.mil.

When a compound appears to be a possible therapeutic candidate, there is a need for more extensive receptor profiling to insure that biological activity is specific to the systems of interest.  Extensive profiling lessens the possibility of unexpected side effects in biological systems not specifically studied in the initial screens.  This contract will provide a mechanism to profile selected compounds at a wide variety of receptor targets, ion channels and enzyme sites to assess the potential for side effects.  The contract allows screening of a large number of substances from pharmaceutical or chemical compound libraries at selected receptors to discover novel compounds with specified biological activity.   ***THE CONTRACTOR should be able to perform the following assays as a core battery, but also have the capacity to perform or develop other assays as needed by NIDA:  NEUROTRANSMITTER related: Adenosine, non-selective; Adrenergic, alpha-1, non-selective;Adrenergic, alpha-2, non-selective; Adrenergic, beta-1;Cannabinoid, CB1; Cannabinoid, CB2;Dopamine, D4.2; GABA-A, agonist site; GABA-A, BDZ, alpha-1 site; GABA-B; Glutamate, AMPA site; Glutamate, Kainate site; Glutamate, NMDA agonist site; Glutamate, mGluR1 (metabotropic); Glutamate, mGluR5 (metabotropic); Glutamate, NMDA, Glycine (strychnine-insensitive site) (ionotropic); Glutamate, NMDA, PCP Site; Glycine, strychnine-sensitive; Histamine, H1; Histamine, H2; Histamine, H3; Muscarinic, M1; Muscarinic, M2;

<DESC>Youngstown Air Reserve Station (YARS) contemplates privatization of its electrical distribution system. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.

Utility Privatization (UP) is accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S. C. 2688.  Utility systems:  Conveyance Authority, Contract term is anticipated at 50 years.

Responses should include the following information: (1) Name, Address, Phone, Fax, e-mail, website address, DUNS number and CAGE Code of the firm and/or any joint venture firm interested in and with the capability to acquire the described system via privatization; (2) Type and size of the firm/joint venture; (3) A listing of other DoD distribution systems acquired by your firm/joint venture, including agency name, contact name; contact number, location(s), description, total values, acquisition dates; and Contracting Officer and Base Civil Engineer point of contact information, including address, phone and fax numbers;  (4) A statement identifying the interested firm?s/joint venture?s capabilities.   Please limit your responses to no more than 10 pages.     

Responses are due no later than 1400 Eastern Standard Time 27 Mar 2008.  This information should be e-mailed to jacqueline.rogers@youngstown.af.mil, with copy to susan.weaver@youngstown.af.mil
  
YARS seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to privatization of utility system in accordance with 10 USC 2688.  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire utility plant and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the utility provider.

YARS currently owns the electrical distribution system located with the boundaries of the installation.  The State of Ohio has proposed deregulation of the electric power industry beginning in January 2009. First Energy/Ohio Edison (OE) currently supplies electrical power to the installation via two 115kV lines through its substation located on King Graves Road, Vienna, Ohio. Components of the substation are listed in below.

1 - High Side Steel Structure, 2 column;
1 - 69 KV bus, 72.5KV 600 Amp air break switch, bus, fuse holders with one fuse per phase;
1 - Transformer, 1981 Westinghouse SHV8985-0201, 3,750 KVA @ 55C, 4200 KVA @ 65C, 69/7.56 KV Y-Y, AL windings;
3 - Arrestors, 60 KV GE;
1 - 15.5 KV Oil Circuit Breaker, 1976 Seimens Allis, 39264-1, 1200 Amp;
3 - Arresters, 10 KV GE;
1 - Transformer, 10 KVA Station Power 7200/240v;
1 - Low Side Steel Structure & Bus, 4 column; 
3 - Single Phase Voltage Regulator, Allis-Chalmers 219 Amp, 167 KVA, 7.62 KV;
1 - 15 KV Bus, fence, insulators, connectors

YARS will work with the Contractor to institute necessary system safeguards and coordination procedures.   No catholic protection equipment is included with the electric system to be privatized.  YARS ability to distribute electric power is essential to its mission and security.  A high emphasis is placed on the station?s ability to operate and maintain its electric distribution system without interruption, and in the event of an outage, to quickly return the system to service.  Key facilities projects planned for YARS will increase the total square footage of buildings on station and the resulting electric demand.  

The contractor will be granted an easement for the portion of the electrical distribution system that crosses on the installation.  An order-of-magnitude inventory report below, containing estimated linear feet and other information for this electrical distribution system will be provided on request.  However, the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the contractor based on the information made available by the Government.  The electrical distribution system conform to commonly accepted industry standards and practices such as the National Electric Safety Code (NESC). 
  
The contractor shall assume ownership of all components downstream of the OE main meter located in the Substation.  Note:  The portions of the system that would remain under the authority of YARS Base Civil Engineering consist of street and parking lot lighting, emergency generators throughout the Base, and electric distribution and lighting within the flight line. Government ownership starts at the point of demarcation (POD). The inventoried portion of the system includes, but is not limited to, conduit, cabling, generators, and lighting fixtures.  Due to the specialized nature of the site lighting throughout the Base, each individual lamp post and associated light fixture is owned and maintained by YARS. These lights and the emergency generators adjacent to various buildings constitute numerous PODs and bound the inventory within the Main Base segment. All wiring, electrical equipment, and light fixtures that are past the fence along the flight line constitute an additional POD and bound the inventory within the Flight Line segment. All equipment downstream of these PODs is presently owned, operated, and maintained by YARS personnel.  The inventoried portion of the electrical distribution system has inherent redundancies and is comprised of approximately 45,000 linear feet of direct bury and overhead line that distributes electricity within the Main Base and Flight Line. Critical lighting systems such as airfield lighting and taxiway lighting are generally less than 20 years old and are in good condition. Numerous emergency generators, 23 in all, of various sizes and capacities are also scattered around the Base.

Transmission voltage shall be distributed throughout the installation for transformation to a primary voltage of 12.5 kV.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring proper distribution of primary voltage for final transformation at the secondary transformer for each building or facility served.  The Government shall assume responsibility at the service entrance (weather head typically) for all services and up to and including the main breaker (disconnect or panel), within a building on the secondary side.  The contractor will be responsible for the underground secondary service from the pad-mounted transformer to the building service entrance.  There are approximately 50 service locations with the installation.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) continues to have a need for storage, monitoring and distributing blood, urine, tissue and other samples collected currently by 23 NICHD programs.  We are looking for capability statements from Small Businesses to determine if this acquisition should be for Small Business Set-Aside.  There are approximately 2.7 million vials of biological specimens that have been collected under various research protocols.  Storing them all will require space for 1,250,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 1,200,000 at -70 degrees C; 215,000 stored in liquid nitrogen (LN).  Over the next seven years, there will be additions to the collections; there must be room for up to 1,400,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 1,750,000 vials at -70 degrees C; 250,000 in LN, totaling approximately 3.5 million specimens.  The following criteria define NICHD's need for the repository.  a)  Respondents must show the capacity for the requisite storage space. All storage must be in the same or adjoining buildings, not more than a walking time of two minutes apart.  Building(s) must be equipped with adequate and appropriate monitoring facilities and back-up electrical power source(s).  b) Respondents must have a computerized inventory system that is able to locate every sample in storage.  It must be a web-based system capable of managing a repository of this size, and able to produce reports for NICHD based on subject ID number and the date the specimen was drawn, as well as other specified information stored in the database.  Since the information collected on the samples from each of the 23 programs differs, the inventory system must be able to accommodate from 3 to 25 items per specimen, including, but not limited to, tracking data for in/out status, quantity of specimen, and number of times thawed.  c) Respondents must demonstrate capability of retrieving specimens from inventory, aliquoting them into a new container, and shipping them to designated locations upon request.  And d) Respondents must demonstrate the capability to receive new specimens into the repository, to catalog them into the database, and to return to inventory all unused portions.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRSAR080339
<RESPDATE>031008
<CONTACT>Milton Spears, Contracting Officer, Phone (757) 441-3245, Fax (757) 441-6080, Email glen.spears@dot.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Maritime Administration intends to solicit Alfa Laval Inc., 955 Mearns Road, Warminster, PA, 18974 on a sole source basis for the replacement of two HFO Purifier EPC 30 controls and MARSAT I displays with a new Alfa Laval EPC 400 controls/display.  The two existing systems onboard the T.S. STATE OF MAINE is an Alfa Laval type FOPX and is currently being controlled by Alfa Laval EPC 30 controls and MARSAT I displays and they are no longer supportable.  The old existing controls will be removed and retained by the vessel for use as spares for the remaining DFM purifier, Alfa Laval type WHPX, and main engine oil purifiers which are using the EPC 30 controls.  In addition, the existing two Robert Shaw steam regulating valves for the HFO purifier heaters are not operational and are being by-passed.  It is also the intent of this item to replace these two steam valve with two Alfa Laval type 57878-07 valves to be controlled by the EPC-400 controls.  (The ship's crew provided oil heater flow rates of 20gpm oil and 450 lb/hr steam which converts to 4543 l/hr old and 204 kg/hr steam resulting in a selection of the DN20/0 valve which is part number 57878-07).  It is the intent to have all required parts delivered to the T.S. STATE OF MAINE, berthed at the Maine Maritime Academy, Pleasant Street, Castine, ME  04220, for the crew to install in accordance with Alfa Laval's bulletin instructions entitled Preparation Requirements for Upgrading to an EPC-41 and/or EPC-400.

<SUBJECT>70 -- SSA SSN Card Printer Replacement Project
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-SSNCPRP
<RESPDATE>031708
<ARCHDATE>04012008
<CONTACT>Christopher Mettee, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9486, Fax 410-965-9560, Email christopher.mettee@ssa.gov - Jacqueline Lessig, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659523, Fax 4109652965, Email jacqueline.lessig@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG), in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and System Operations (OTSO), is currently performing market research to determine the availability of printers capable of printing Social Security Number (SSN) cards to replace its two IBM 6262 printers. SSA is seeking information from interested sources regarding the availability of printer technologies or printers capable of printing SSN cards utilizing its current card mailer substrate with minimal/no programmatic changes required as workarounds.  In addition to information regarding the printer, SSA requests details regarding availability, security, maintainability, stability, and the capacity to accommodate a ten percent annual growth.

This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation. 

In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.   This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought/market research notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.  

SSA recently had a secure printer replacement study conducted to develop alternative solutions to the current SSN card print environment.  Potential options for replacements were Flash Fusion/Electrophotography (LED Array) and UV Cured Inkjet print technologies. SSA is seeking the availability of these options and other options available with consideration placed upon availability through the GSA Federal Supply Schedule or Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC).

SSA currently prints an average of 80,000 SSN cards per day.  The size of the SSN card is 4 inches by 8 inches, and is printed in the 1-up format on 90 pound paper.  When printing SSN cards, SSA uses 8 inches by 9 inches 90 pound paper and two cards are printed per page.  The 9 inch dimension currently contains tractor feeds that are cut off during the insertion process.  In the future, SSA anticipates changing this fan fold to roll stock.  

Printing requirements are as follows:  

1) Each printer must be capable of printing 120,000 SSN cards per 8 hour shift. The duty cycle per printer will be approximately 1 million pages per month.

2) The print operator needs to be able to start, stop, and restart print jobs as well as control priorities and print order.   

3) Must be capable of printing on pin-fed stock and be adaptable to accept roll feed with two-up or three-up stock. 

4) Must be capable of printing a black-based font on SSA current stock (pre-printed, 90 pound banknote stock).  

5) Character set should be comparable to the proprietary character set currently used on SSN cards to print SSN and Name. Character set will be provided by SSA.

6) Printed character on the SSN card substrate must be recognizable by OCR readers within the current SSA Track and Trace system.

7) The printed character must pass 2 distinct performance tests.  The first test is for adhesion to the SSN card substrate. Efforts to remove the printed character from the SSN card substrate or to alter the printed character must be visible to the human eye using no extraordinary measures.  The second test is durability testing which consists of 3 elements.  The 3 test elements are: 1) Flexion (fold); 2) Fingernail Scratch Resistance; and 3) Razor.  SSA intends to perform strict acceptance testing of all offers received upon the issuance of a Solicitation, if one is issued. Not having the ability to meet any of the above performance tests will disqualify a proposed print solution.

8) Both printers must fit within the current SSN card production facility.

9) The recommended solution must be configured for hardware redundancy.  In the event of primary printer failure, SSA master coordinator will redirect printer output to the secondary printer. 

10) Printers must cease printing upon error and must indicate the problem by displaying a visible malfunction indicator or message upon the printer. 

11) Printers must have a visual display showing error messages and/or error codes.

12) Power requirement is:  200 - 220V @ 47-62Hz, Three Phase NEMA L15-30

13) Each printer must include a Cat 5E Ethernet Patch cable, 12 feet long with RJ 45 connectors on each end.

14) Only new equipment is acceptable.

15) Must be Energy Star(r) compliant.

16) Must be IPv6 compliant.

17) Must provide one years consumables (i.e., Toner Kit, developer, Waste Toner  Box)

18) Installation services will be included with the delivery of the printers and shall include unpacking and initial set-up (configuration services).

19) RJ-45 Ethernet connection of 10/100 MHz using AFP (Native IPDES), PDF, PCL, TIFF, Postscript.

20) Output stacker tray.

21) The contractor shall provide on-call, on-site maintenance for all hardware supplied for a period of 1 year following the acceptance of each printer (warranty period). 

22) Optional:  a soundproof cabinet or encasement.


The workload supported by these printers is under severe scheduling constrains. If a printer stops for any reason, on site technical support is required within 4 hours, six days a week (Monday through Saturday).  The contractor shall be responsible for providing repair services when any part of the contractor-provided hardware fails to perform properly.  The principal period of operation for these printers is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

The printers will be located in Baltimore, Maryland.  After the initial warranty period expires, maintenance requirements for SSA are:  
 
1) On-call maintenance with a confirmation callback to SSA within 60 minutes of initial contact.

2) Certified technician arrival onsite at SSA Headquarters located in Baltimore, Maryland within 4 hours of callback.

3) All emergency repairs and preventive maintenance service calls will be considered part of the maintenance program. All associated costs are to be included in the overall maintenance contract.

4) Preventive maintenance is to be performed based on the suggested schedule by the manufacturer.  All time and materials utilized in performance of a preventive maintenance service call are included in overall maintenance costs.  Preventive maintenance must be performed outside of the principal period of operation.  SSA considers, at a minimum, the following item  as part of the preventive maintenance program: 

a) Developing Unit
b) Image Drum
c) Cleaning Unit
d) Main Charging Unit
e) Pre-Charging Unit

5) Printers must be returned to service within 4 hours of arrival onsite by a technician.

6) In the event, the printer can not be repaired within 48 hours of the initial service request; contractor must provide a replacement printer to SSA at no additional cost to the government, within 3 business days.  The replacement printers must be of identical make and model.

If determined to be in the best interest of the Government to issue a Solicitation based upon responses to this Sources Sought announcement, responders are notified that SSA may request in-house testing as part of the Solicitation evaluation process at no additional cost to the Government.

Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Christopher Mettee, Contract Specialist, Division of Information Technology and Maintenance, 7111 Security Boulevard, 1st Floor Rear Entrance, Baltimore, MD 21244. Responses must be sent electronically via email at Christopher.Mettee@ssa.gov. Please reference SSA-RFI-SSNCPRP in the e-mail subject line. No telephone responses will be accepted. Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on March 17, 2008.

<DESC>The United States Military Academy, West Point, New York is conducting a market survey to ascertain availability of any commercial firms within a 100 MILE RADIUS OF WEST POINT, NEW YORK that might be able to meet the FULL RANGE of current and project ed workload requirements for the Academys laundry and dry cleaning service needs.  The objective of this synopsis is to identify business sources which can provide all plant, facilities, equipment, tools, materials, supplies, transportation, labor and sup ervision necessary to coordinate, plan and perform CONTRACTOR OWNED CONTRACTOR OPERATED (COCO) pick-up, processing, storage, and delivery of a wide variety of articles to include, but not limited to:  Cadet Uniforms and Civilian Clothing Work (from socks a nd underwear; bras and panties; military and civilian shirts, trousers, skirts, blouses, dresses, blazers and suits; athletic shirts, shorts, sweat suits; swim trunks, bathing suits and running ensembles; combat uniforms and accessories; pajamas and robes;   bed linens, pillows, comforters and wool blankets; to both current fabric and style and historically based wool uniforms including trousers, shirts, skirts, dress jackets and coats, parkas, and long and short overcoats), Organizational Bulk Work (dining facility tablecloths and accessories; bed linens and blankets; tactical equipment such as field packs, ammo, compass and canteen cases, ponchos and sleeping bags;  chemical protective over garments and protective mask carriers; tactical armor vests; custod ial items such as mop heads, dust mops, and cleaning cloths; canvas and nylon lifting slings; mascot costumes; and restaurant and hotel type articles), and Medical Treatment Facility Work (including Hospital, Dental, and Veterinarian activities).  Combined  estimated workload is about 3,000,000 pieces per year, consisting of approximately 2,800,000 laundry and 200,000 dry cleaning articles.  Cadet work approximates 2,200,000 pieces, including the majority of dry cleaning articles, Organizational work around 650,000 pieces, and Medical Treatment Facility work approximating 150,000 pieces.  Corps strength approximates 4,500 cadets organized in 4 regiments of roughly equal size, Organizational Accounts number 30 to 40 on a fluctuating basis, and there are 3 Medi cal Treatment Facility activities.  The approximately 250 person US Military Academy Preparatory School (USMAPS) is also scheduled to relocate to West Point in 2011, although workload is not known or included in data, but would be incorporated in COCO requ irements at that time.  During June-August annually, additional Corps task organizations (Summer Garrison Regiment, Summer Term Academic Program, Cadet Basic Training, Cadet Field Training, and Cadet Air Assault Training are also established at various loc ations, some within 10 miles of West Point proper.  Also during this period, an additional task force and augmentation involving about 1,200 soldiers total arrives and departs on varying schedules, to assist in the Military Training Cycle, requiring an ind eterminate number and workload of both individual and organizational nature.  This activity is established at yet another separate location approximately 8 miles from West Point Proper and is serviced as a separate entity for scheduling, pick-up, processin g and delivery, to be established each period.  Pick-up and delivery is required at up to 15 to 20 designated outdoor locations for cadet organizations, and each of the organizational accounts, including the Cadet Mess and the West Point Hospital.  All cad et work is required to be picked up and delivered at least once weekly, Cadet Mess Work and West Point Hospital work daily.  Organizational work fluctuates as activity operations dictate.  Cadet work must be processed and delivered within 2-3 days of pick- up, as must Organizational work, except Cadet Mess and Hospital work which must be delivered within 24 hours. During Cadet Summer Training Period, frequency of pick-ups increase to 2 or 3 times weekly for each of the task organizations, with processing and delivery time reduced to 24-48 hours.  Pick-up and delivery locations, except for Cadet Mess and Hospital, do not have loading docks or ramps, therefore delive ry and pick-up requires use of vehicles with lifts or ramps due to volume and weight of work.  During Spring Break (1 week in March), Fall Break (1 week in November), Christmas Break (2 weeks in late December to early January), while cadets are on home lea ve, and during Cadet Summer Training Period (end-May thru mid August) significant amounts of Cadet work submitted for processing but not deliverable due to cadet absence en masse, must be stored for later delivery.  Peak storage of finished work pending de livery currently approximates 150 to 200 20-Bushel Laundry Carts and 150 to 200 6-Foot Garment racks during Cadet Summer Training Period (end-May thru mid-August).  Delivery and pick-up of work, including finished work, must be accomplished in wheeled cart s, not larger than 20-Bushel, and garment racks, not large than 6-feet long and 5 to 6 feet tall, due to the distribution requirements within the Corps and Organizations post-delivery.  Carts and racks must be left at delivery points for customer use in fu rther distribution, post-delivery.  Finished work must be protected from elements due to the outdoor nature of most designated locations.  Individual cadet laundry must be bundled and identified per customer, plastic wrapped and string tied to protect arti cles from elements and enable efficient handling during distribution post-delivery.  Designated articles (all dry cleaning and selected laundry items) require hanger service, and selected items (particularly India White Dress Coats and Trousers) require pl astic bagging to preserve starched, pressed, and pure white appearance.  Processes to be used vary with the article.  Wash and tumble, wash and fold, wash and press, starch and press, dry clean and press, dry clean and steam, fold and bundle, hanger, hange r and bag, are all required.  Civilian clothing is processed IAW care labels and industry standards.       <BR>The NAICS code is 812330 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.  This announcement is market research for information and planning  purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this Sources Sought announcement.  This market research does not constitute a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<SUBJECT>99 -- International Broadcast Rights for TV Programming from MarVista Entertainment
<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
(COMPUTER WORKSTATION)


This is a notice of intent to issue an order to MarVista Entertainment, Inc., on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and is for the international television programming broadcast rights.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.
  
This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP).     A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Solicitation/synopsis reference number 316480606456 is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and incorporates the following with the word ?quoter? substituted for ?offeror?.  

Provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-22 effective 23 NOV 2007. 

	(1)  FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items) (JAN 2005):
		(a)	Re para (a):  NAICS 334220; small business size standard is 750 employees.
		(b)	Note that para (k) requires quoter to be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at time order is issued and throughout performance.

	(2)	FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation ? Commercial Items) (JAN 1999) with the following insertion in para (a) ?lowest priced technically acceptable quote with acceptable past performance.?  Technical evaluation will be whether quoted items satisfy all requirements in CLINs 0001 thru 0003 descriptions below.

This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  The most common method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  Options within WAWF include a, ?stand-alone? invoice and a ?combo? that includes both the payment request and the receiving document required to validate the object of the invoice has been received in an acceptable condition.  The experience of this office in the administration of electronic invoices has shown that the use of  the ?combo? invoice, when available,  will result in much quicker more accurate payment.  The matching by the WAWF system of invoices and receiving reports individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity routinely cause problems because they do not appear together and must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the ?combo? does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching.

Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . Training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.

Quotations may be emailed to Fayette.White@dodmedia.osd.mil or sent via fax to (951) 413-2432.    Due to technical issues email and fax may not result in your proposal arriving before the cut-off time, please allow extra time if you?re sending your quote via electronic means.

(4)	Quotations must include completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items) (MAR 2005) with Alt 1 (APR 2002) or indication that reps and certs are in ORCA.

<SUBJECT>M -- Notice of Intent to Issue a Sole Source Contract Extension
<DESC>NAICS Code 561210 Facilities Support Services.  Size Standard $32.5 million. 

The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Services, Boston Service Center, Boston, Massachusetts intends to issue a sole source contract modification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to extend Contract No. GS-01P-96-BWC-0062 for a 4-month performance period from April 1, 2008, through July 31, 2008.   The current contract provides Commercial Facility Management Services (CFM) for the John J. Moakley U.S. Courthouse, Boston, MA and will expire on March 31, 2008.   Proposal have been received for the follow on contract under solicitation number GS-01P-07-BW-D-0063 and are in the evaluation process.  The process is taking longer than anticipated due to the complex multidiscipline nature of the CFM services.  Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and new award to ensure continuity of services and support the transition to a new competitive award.

Description of the work to be performed:  The contractor is to furnish all material, labor, equipment, supervision and services necessary to perform full CFM for a four (4) month extension for Moakley Courthouse.  Contractor will be responsible for full building management services and is fully responsible for the management, customer service, operation, mechanical maintenance, janitorial services, elevator operations and maintenance, snow removal, energy management, management of parking facilities, loading dock, trash facilities, public realm, boat dock, utility systems and quality control and engineering of the facility and of the associated grounds with all necessary labor, materials, supplies, technical support and value engineering. 

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services.  A lapse in service will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide building services to federal agencies in the New England region. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of facilities of this size and complexity by a firm that is familiar with the equipment and hold current security clearances.  Boston Courthouse Management is has been performing these services since 1997 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 4-month performance period. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame with, it may give notification via e-mail to Shirley McCarthy, Contract Specialist, at shirley.mccarthy@gsa.gov no later than March 24, 2008, 10:00 a.m., EST.

<SUBJECT>A -- NATO NC3A Invitation to Participate in Market Survey of Existing Capabilities in Support of Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB)
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) is performing a survey of tools that support the process of Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB). NC3A invites interested firms and government agencies to participate in this survey. 

IPB underpins many aspects of intelligence processing, including collection, processing, support to effects-based operations, war gaming, targeting, and providing the foundation for the Operational Planning Process (OPP).

Traditional IPB is an analytic methodology, a systematic and continuous process of analyzing the threat and environment in a specific geographical area. These processes are well understood and involve an established array of technologies, techniques, analytic methods, and talented personnel to ensure intelligence superiority. The emergence of employment scenarios other than force-on-force, however, has challenged this intelligence superiority in many ways.

In response, the Allied Command for Transformation (ACT) has created an R&D project to address requirements and processes supporting IPB. The project, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace for Low Intensity Conflict (LIC), has this market survey as a primary action. The aim of the survey is to identify existing and developing tools and data sources, releasable for use by NATO, which would support both traditional IPB and IPB for LIC and Peace-Support Operations (PSO).

<SUBJECT>U -- Professional Development Module
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education's, 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program is a State formula-grant program authorized under Title IV, Part B, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.  The No Child Left Behind Act converted the 21st CCLC program from discretionary grants, administered directly by the Department of Education, to a program in which each State receives an allotment under a formula based on their share of Title I, Part A funds.  States must use their allocations to make competitive awards to eligible entities.  Grants made under the antecedent program will continue to be managed at the Federal level until they expire.  The Secretary may reserve up to one percent of the total appropriation for the 21st CCLC program to carry out an array of national activities, including but not limited to national evaluations and the technical assistance.

The objective of the 21st CCLC program is to enable community learning centers to have the ability to plan, implement, or expand after-school learning enrichment opportunities to help students meet State and local standards in core content areas.  21st CCLC programs must primarily serve children who attend schools identified with high-poverty, while also giving priority to serving children in low-performing schools based on State standards.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Contract
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Sunnyvale, CA for continuation of the Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) Program under a 27-month Phase 1B (Option 1) and 16 month Phase 2 (Option 2) contract.  A Sole Source announcement relating to the award of a 15 month Phase 1A (base) contract for ABC activities was previously announced on 17 December 2007 (SN08-12); however, this announcement inadvertently did not announce the Government's intention to negotiate all three phases (1A, 1B and 2) of the follow-on research program as a single contract action.  Previous Phase 0 ABC activities were completed by Lockheed Martin under contract FA9550-04-C-0142. Under the Phase 0 contract, Lockheed Martin investigated the utility of a high energy laser, integrated into a high-speed tactical aircraft for self-defense, and explored experimental techniques to characterize and influence aero-optic beam quality.  The proposed Phase 1B and Phase 2 efforts are logical follow-ons to the Phase 0 effort conducted by Lockheed Martin under contract FA9550-04-C-0142 and Phase 1A effort previously announced to demonstrate a turbulence control method in order to improve power flux on target in high speed flight, particularly in the lateral and aft field of regard. Specifically, under Phase 1B, Lockheed Martin will conduct a full scale test of a turret using representative optical paths, a full scale turret model, and representative flow control actuators with an adaptive optics system in the loop.  Under Phase 2, Lockheed Martin will undertake a preliminary design effort for a flight test turret incorporating flow control approaches identified in the full scale wind tunnel test.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  As the developer of the ABC concept, Lockheed Martin possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and proprietary intellectual property/data required to carry out the required research effort.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Responses/proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 23 April 2008 to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Michael D. Blackstone, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to michael.blackstone@darpa.mil.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 27 March 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 25 March 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester' concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations have the right to submit quotes equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.

STATEMENT OF WORK AND SPECIFICATIONS:
The intent of this Statement of Work is to request removal, supply and installation of new Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries throughout the USP and camp. The VRLA batteries have exceeded the manufacturers 5 year replacement.  The current batteries were installed in our UPS systems in 2000.

USP Big Sandy requires a qualified contractor to replace all 322 VLRA batteries with new VLRA batteries.  The contractor would be responsible to load test each battery to ensure proper float level.  Also the contractor must provide a certificate that will show proper disposal of the replaced batteries. 

The contractor will be responsible for furnishing all equipment, materials, technical expertise, labor, transportation, tools and any other supplies required to meet requirements of this Statement of Work. If there is any damage to the property due to negligence, the Contractor shall take sole responsibility for all repairs. Any spillage or leakage clean up costs will be the responsibility of the Contractor. The United States Penitentiary reserves the right to request proof of proper disposal of any and all hazardous waste generated during this work.

PROJECT LOCATION:

<DESC>BLAST BOXES

The 96 Contracting Squadron, 96 CONS/MSCB at Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit and award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for 2 steel blast boxes to be constructed from normalized 4340 steel grade material. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quotation is being requested, and a written request for quotation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) F1TBAM7338A001-A. This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 332710, with small business standard size of 500 employees. Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This requirement is for the following. 

CLIN 0001: Two (2) each, LARGE BLAST BOX, in accordance with specifications and drawings. Specify delivery date for this CLIN.
CLIN 0002: Two (2) each, SMALL BLAST BOX, in accordance with specifications and drawings. Specify delivery date for this CLIN.

CLIN 0001 must be delivered first.

SPECIFICATIONS are as follows: 

The two steel blast boxes shall be constructed from normalized 4340 steel grade material. The two blastboxes are distinguished as large or small pertaining to the opening created once assembled. Each blastbox is constructed of four walls and four edges designed to mate together as slip fits with little room for movement between adjoining parts. 

Walls:

There are two walls designated long and short to distinguish them. The long wall has overall dimensions of 95?X24?X3? whereas the short wall has overall dimensions of 41.75?X24?X3?. The vendor will cut slots from their 3? depth so they can accept the edges needed to complete the blastbox assembly. The vendor will tap and drill two holes so that the walls can be lifted and moved into place.

Edges:

There are two edges designated long and short to distinguish them. For the large box, the long edge has overall dimensions of 81.5?X6?X11.44? and overall dimensions of 25.38?X6?X11.44? for the short edge. To complete assembly of the box two of each edge will need to be constructed.

The edges for the small box has overall dimensions of 54.88?X6?X11.44? for its long edge and overall dimensions of 25.38?X6?X11.44? for its short edge. To complete assembly of the box two of each edge will need to be constructed.

Construction:

The vendor shall perform manufacturing processes without dramatically altering the material properties of the normalized 4340 steel material, i.e. torching shouldn?t be considered. It is important that material properties be kept consistent from start to finish as much as possible. Tolerances for dimensions shall be held to the hundredths. 

Shipping:

FOB Destination. 

Drawings are available upon request. Please send requests for the drawings to Ms. Mary Gardner, mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil or to Ms. Manivanh Mundy, manivanh.mundy@eglin.af.mil .

The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government?s best interest to do so.

You may send a quote for one line item or for both.

Solicitation number is HSCG85-08-Q-66R528 is issued as a Request for Quotations.

The Form, Fit and Function of these parts must be exactly compatible with the existing CAT Main Diesel Engines and is critical to the safe operation of these cutters in extreme environments. It is the government's belief that only CATERPILAR, its parent Fairbanks-Morse, or authorized distributors can provide these critical parts. Note: No Drawings, Specifications or schematics are available from this agency. That information is proprietary to Fairbanks Morse and the Coast Guard is unable to supply any information other than part name and part number to prospective offerors. However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to manufacture these parts to OEM specifications are invited and encouraged to submit proposals.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Below are TSA responses to questions received from potential offerors.

Questions/Responses:

Q1. Please define ?adequate size? to accommodate large working dog. Is the U.S. Army standard acceptable?

R1.The solicitation allows the offeror to propose a kenneling solution adequate to accommodate a large working dog. The government would like offerors to provide a unit that they feel will be sufficient. Offerors are allowed to offer more than one product for the government?s consideration.     The product information provided should include description with size/dimensions. This information will be evaluated by the government as part of the technical evaluation.

This information will be evaluated by the government as part of the technical evaluation.


Q3.I have a question about the solicitation that concerns the specification about off the floor. Your requirement is that the floor should not be resting on the ground? Does this mean that no part of the floor can contact the ground of that the majority of the floor cannot contact the ground. This has serious engineering ramifications that could result in increased cost or a proposal that is not competitive if this requirement were clarified

R3. The kennel should be sufficiently elevated so that as no part of the floor touches the ground. 


Q4.Is there additional information on the kenneling requirements (size and more detailed specifications)? If the kennels are used today are there any pictures of their design.     Any help would be appreciated.

R4.This is a new requirement. The kennels are not currently being used.The government would like offerors to provide a unit that they feel will be sufficient. Offerors are allowed to offer more than one product for the government?s consideration. The product information provided should include description with capabilities and benefits. This information will be evaluated by the government as part of the technical evaluation.

All other terms and conditions of the original Solicitation MCC-08-0063-RFQ-52 remains in full force and effect.
tage is available, but MCC staff will help narrow down the footage.  

Question 42:  Can we assume the optional 8 minute ?infomercial? would be the same scope as the first infomercial?
Abswer 42:  Yes. 

Question 43:  Under Description, #1, there is no mention of shooting for the 1-2 minute DVD. Will it consist entirely of MCC-provided b-roll footage with narration?
Answer 43:   MCC will provide b-roll.  Vendor needs to provide script with a person doing voice overs.  

Question 44:  Under Description, #2, there is mention of a ?crew to interview MCC officials??would this be the only original footage shot, with the rest to consist of MCC provided b-roll?
Answer 44:  Yes. 

Question 45:  Under Description, #3, regarding ?live onsite webcasting or delayed webcasting,? Are these events all in the Washington DC area or should the contractor anticipate travel?
Answer 45:  All in DC. 

Question 46:  What is the average duration of the live webcasting events (half-day or full-day)? Answer 46:  MCC?s public events usually last 1.5-2 hours (not including the vendors? travel and setup/takedown time).  

Question 47:  Under Deliverables, the first deliverable (initial cut) for the 1-2 minute DVD commercial is due ?5 days after contract award.? Is this correct? In our experience, this would not be enough time to kickoff the contract, write a script, review b-roll, record narration, and edit to the rough cut stage, even under a tightly compressed schedule.
Answer 47:  We would like to stick to the 5 day schedule.  MCC staff is committed to helping the vendor complete the product by this timeline by reviewing the deliverables and proving comments quickly.  

Question 48:  Under description # 3, regarding providing equipment, i.e. ?Mackie?,  can you verify the webcasting events provide in-house audio for live on-site audience?  In other words, would awardee be responsible for providing audio to anyone other than web audience?
Answer 48:  Usually the location of the outreach events has only ONE mult outlet for the house audio, thus MCC needs vendor to have a Mackie board so that others may plug in.  Example, if TV or radio outlets such as VOA cover the event, we will need for them to plug into the vendor?s Mackie board.  Also, we usually have a transcription company plug into the makie board.

<DESC>Questions and Answers about F1TBAM7338A001-A

1.	The drawing for the small blast box pin does not state material or quantity.
Answer: We don't ask that they quote the pins for the box. We are able to make the pins ourselves. Vendors need to keep in mind that the only parts that need to be quoted for both boxes are the edges and walls only. The edges and walls are just parts of the blastbox, and not the blastbox in its entirety. 

2. The small blast box insert box, no method of attachment. Stated as a protruding feature, how far does it protrude?
 Answer: Again, we do not ask to have these items quoted. All we need are the edges and walls for both the small and large blastboxes.

3. Small blast box, long wall, 16.80" wide slot 2 places, is this correct?
 Answer: Yes, there are two slots that don?t go all the way through the material. 

4.On walls, edges and mating parts, the clearance listed ranges from 1/8-1", is this correct?
 Answer: The clearances do vary between parts, but we are not aware of any 1" clearances.

5. No finish requirements are listed for machined parts.
 Answer: As long as there aren?t any finishes so rough that it will injure someone to touch them, we are okay with the finish the material comes with.

6. If there are no callouts for radius or chamfered corners, we would normally assume .030" break on edges.
 Answer: The back of the wedges for the small blast box calls for a 1/4"X45degree chamfer. We would like for all the back edges of all edges to have this feature.

7. No revision on drawings, only one rev?
 Answer: You are right - there are no revisions.

8. No insert box listed for Large blast box, is this correct?
 Answer: There is no insert box for the large box. Again, vendors should only be quoting the edges and walls, not the entire box.

9. Any drawings of assembled boxes available?
 Answer: No assembly drawings available, but we do have bitmaps showing how all of it goes together. You may request the bitmaps by contacting Ms. Mary Gardner mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil.


All other terms and conditions remain the same.
