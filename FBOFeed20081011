<DESC>The U.S.D.A. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have worked cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) since 1998 to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (NRA), including eight butterflies endemic to the Spring Mountains.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morand’s checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  These were identified as priority in the CA based on a limited number of locations where the butterflies are currently known to occur.  Autecology studies are imperative to determine why the ranges of these four species are restricted and help provide detailed information necessary to restore and improve butterfly habitat and range.  Given the demand to provide recreation and other uses on the Spring Mountains NRA, there is an urgent need to understand the basic biology and develop a management strategy for these four butterfly species to appropriately inform decision making.  

The Solicitation will be posted at this website on or about 10/25/2008.  If there is a "Pre-Proposal" conference/site walk offered, the details will be in the solicitation, once published.  The technical point of contact is Amy Meketi, (702) 515-5421.  All questions should be submitted in writing via FAX to Contracting Officer at (702) 839-5599 or E-mail at sroehr@fs.fed.us so that we have a record of the question, and can make a determination if the answer needs to be published in the form of a solicitation amendment.

<DESC>The U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD's) intends to establish a pool of vendors from whom MARAD can request pricing for and award contracts to dismantle obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleets. Under this Request for Quotation (RFQ) DTMA1Q09001, offerors will be requested to submit technical proposals to provide environmentally-sound dismantling services.  MARAD will evaluate all the domestic contractors' proposals it receives. Those offerors that are found to be technically acceptable will form a pool vendors cleared to compete for the dismantling work. MARAD will then periodically solicit pricing from these vendors in the pool and to award recycling contracts during the period between posting of the RFQ through December 31, 2009. The RFQ will remain open throughout the year for vendors to submit technical proposals in response to the RFQ. Offerors who have been found to be technically acceptable under the 2008 standing quotations process are considered qualified but will need to submit a certification that their previous technical proposal and any updates are complete and up-to date.  Those who are technically not acceptable but susceptible to being made acceptable will need to update their proposals.  MARAD is currently not accepting new proposals for foreign recycling under this RFQ. Under the fee-for-service process, MARAD pays for ship dismantlement services and under the Vessel Sales process, MARAD sells vessels for dismantlement. MARAD's obsolete vessels are principally located in three reserve fleet locations: the James River Reserve Fleet, (JRRF), Ft. Eustis, VA, Suisan Bay Reserve Fleet, (SBRF), Benicia, CA and Beaumont Reserve Fleet (BRF), Beaumont TX. It is anticipated that RFQ DTMA1Q09001 will be issued on or about October 15, 2008 at http://ideasec.nbc.gov and on the Virtual Office of Acquisition at https://voa.marad.dot.gov/. The RFQ related documents are available via MARAD's Virtual Office of Acquisition library (VOA) website https://voa.marad.dot.gov/programs/ship_disposal/index.asp. MARAD will only accept quotations submitted through this VOA website. Submissions via any other medium will neither be accepted nor evaluated. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer which will be considered by MARAD.  If you have questions regarding this solicitation, please contact John Desch at john.desch@dot.gov.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Primary Requirement: 

The primary requirement of this effort is to create interactive and engaging e-learning materials to be distributed primarily via the US Treasury’s learning management system (Plateau), OCC’s intranet, or on CD-ROM or DVD. 

Course, module, or lesson will contain elements allowing OCC to track participant progress.  This will include name, bookmark, and lesson status:  not started, launched, or completed. Test results will also be captured. 

Eighty percent of the learning objects should be interactive.  Interactivity is defined as at least one activity item (scenario, exercise, etc.) for every 15 minutes of instruction.  A learning object is defined as an intact unit of learning supported by an enabling objective and can be completed within 15 minutes by the participant.  

Graphics shall be limited to two-dimensional figures.  Any video and/or audio that would be required would be used to illustrate concepts.  Because some content is process oriented, there may be content requiring animated graphics.  

An average of 80 screens per hour is the baseline for estimating the length of the e-learning materials.

Common navigational tools will be used throughout the modules or lessons.  Tools to be used will be mutually agreed upon by OCC and contractor.

Each course, module, or lesson shall contain a menu, a title identifying the  unit of instruction, instructions on how to take the lessons, a time estimate for completion, progress indicators, etc.  

The participant shall be able to exit from any screen with common book marking protocols employed. 

E-learning product design must take into consideration OCC bandwidth.  Some of the OCC employees are mobile and therefore use dial-up.

If the course, module or lesson requires an e-mail to be sent from within the course, format compatibility will be identified in the formal solicitation.

Course, module, or lesson shall support industry standards, including AICC or SCORM 1.2.

Course, module, or lesson shall be Section 508 compliant.

Print function shall be active in every screen and for every document within the screen.

Course, module, or lesson shall be downloadable to student’s hard drive.

Secondary Requirement:

The secondary requirement under this contract is to provide an array of performance enhancement solutions using instructional design consultation services.  An offeror’s ability to provide these services is considered secondary to the primary purpose of this contract.  An offerors inability to provide a wide range of performance enhancement solutions will not, by itself, remove an offeror from consideration on this contract. 


The OCC is anticipating a contract start date of on/about January 1, 2009.  We request identification of companies that are interested and capable to support this requirement.

Please provide company name, contact, business size and identify if your company can support Tier 1 and/or Tier 2, and whether or not Tier 2 could be provided via a subcontract if your company cannot provide it directly.  Also, please identify if this service is provided under a GSA contract (identify contract number) or open market.
