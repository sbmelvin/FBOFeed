<DESC>RRB Specialty MAC (Part B) Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), RRB, as authorized under paragraph 1842(b)(1) of the Social Security Act, must solicit and compete its Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (Specialty MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a Specialty MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of RRB in concert with Medicare Program direction from CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a nationwide "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with RRB and CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with RRB's technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor may also enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Beneficiary and Provider Customer Service Program (BPCSP) that educates providers and beneficiaries about the Medicare program and responds to provider and beneficiary telephone and written inquiries and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>RRB anticipates releasing a solicitation for this nationwide jurisdiction on or about November 3, 2010. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is January 11, 2011 with an anticipated award date of June 1, 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<a href="mailto:archie.peay@us.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)About Managing End Cryptographic Units via the Black Interface
This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes - Oct 1997) and is published only to encourage interested Commercial Business parties capable of providing technical support for use by the United States Air Force Electronic Systems Center Cryptologic Systems Division, Cryptographic Modernization Program Office (AF CMPO), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, for planning purposes only.
This RFI does NOT constitute an invitation for bids, a request for proposal, a solicitation, a request for quote or an indication that the government will contract for the items provided by submitter(s). The government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested.
The CMPO is in the process of designing and specifying a SNMP-based black-side management technology suite suitable for managing End Cryptographic Units, or ECUs. The effort includes recent work culminating in the Internet Engineer Task Force Request for Comments document 5953 (IETF RFC 5953.) It also includes ongoing discussions about Management Information Base (MIB) modules for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and some preliminary development activities with regard to uniform ECU MIB modules for managing cryptographic functions. The CMPO is seeking comments on the preliminary Generic ECU MIB, as well as answers to the following questions. For access to the draft Generic ECU MIB, please send an email digitally signed by a valid DoD External Certificate Authority-issued certificate to the Contractor Officer listed below requesting the Generic ECU MIB in response to this RFI.
1) What experience does your company have in managing ECUs via SNMP?2) What ECU products have you developed or are developing that have an Internet Protocol-based black-side remote management capability?3) If remote management functionality were split across the red/high and black/low interfaces, what functionality could/would be allocated to the low side?4) Would a black-side management capability require a separate network interface or could it be integrated into the existing low-side interface?5) Please characterize the impact unified black-side remote management of cryptographic and other network devices would have on your product set.6) What hurdles would drive you to implement Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) templates in an ECU instead of a full CMS parsing capability for Over-The-Network Keying (OTNK), and how might those hurdles be overcome?7) What are your plans to integrate OTNK into your ECUs? How would you add remote management to those plans?8) RFC 5953:a. What IETF standards are foundational to implement RFC 5953?b. What ambiguities are you aware of in RFC 5953, and how would you resolve them?c. What guidance should be given to ensure consistent& interoperable implementations between vendors of RFC 5953 in products purchased by the Air Force?9) What SNMP access control model would you use in conjunction with RFC 5953, and why? What limitations would you put on users' abilities to configure that access control model, and why?10)What public key infrastructure would you utilize to provision the certificates and certificate revocation lists for the Datagram Transport Layer Security Transport Model (DTLS TM)? What is your capability to public key-enable such an implementation?11)What else should the CMPO know about black-side remote management of ECUs, or remote management of ECUs in general?
In addition to the above listed questions, please provide the following information:
What is your CAGE code?
What is your business size?
If you are a Small Business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories: 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, HUB Zone Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and HBCU/MI?
For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 334111, 334210, 334220, 334290, 334419, 334511, 517919, or 561621? If not, why not?
Are you on one or more GSA schedules? If so, which one(s)?
Please limit your response to question 1 to 2 pages, and your overall response to no more than 30 pages, excluding answers to the CAGE, size, and small business questions above. All interested, capable, and responsible sources that wish to respond to this RFI are encouraged to provide your capabilities to design, develop or provide a device, product specifications or on-shelf technology base, and possible development schedule and cost (exclusive of NSA certification) via electronic mail no later than November 15, 2010 to:

Therefore, the Government intends to proceed with sole source procurement for the required supplies and or services. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-5 - Authorized by Statue and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. To the best of our knowledge, Alliant Heatlthcare Products, Richland, MI is the only source that provides the above indicated items and features. This is a notice of intent to sole source and is not a request for competitive quotes. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Telephone and facsimile requests/inquiries will not be accepted. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at ronald.heidemann@va.gov. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Cincinnati VA Medical Center will precede with the sole source negotiation with Alliant Heatlthcare Products, Richland, MI.

<DESC>FAA Aviation Weather Group Aircraft Weather Observations and Reports Program Market Survey
The US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Aviation Weather Group (AWG) is part of the FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and Operations Planning Business Unit. The mission of the AWG is to realize the future of aviation by providing integrated weather strategies and solutions to achieve national and international goals. AWG does this by developing and coordinating the strategic direction for weather initiatives in the FAA's Aviation Weather Enterprise, including NextGen requirements, to mitigate the impact of weather in the National Airspace System (NAS).Purpose of the Market SurveyThe FAA has a requirement for the collection, format and dissemination of automated aircraft upper air weather observation data. This data are used in aviation models to produce more timely and accurate aviation weather analysis and forecast.  This requirement includes a task for the collection, and dissemination of the automated aircraft performance data.Interested parties should complete all parts of this document as instructed below. We also invite you to submit additional information to supplement the document that may offer greater insight about your organization and its capabilities.Please be advised that this is a market survey. This is not a solicitation, Screening Information Request (SIR), or Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind and cannot be construed as a commitment by the FAA for either future business or a future contractual relationship with the FAA. Please note that this market survey does not commit the FAA to a contract nor commit the FAA to issue an RFP or SIR.All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred or associated with any submission received from any interested party in response to this market survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with the submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.The purpose of this market survey is to gather information that will assist the FAA in determining the availability of vendors that can collect, format, and disseminate automated aircraft upper air weather observation data.The FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on the results of this survey.  If this survey results in a competitive acquisition, the competition will be limited to those vendors who responded to this survey and were evaluated and determined to be qualified for all factors.
Background and ScopeThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) obligates states to have a program for the observing, recording, and reporting of weather observations from aircraft operating on international air routes.  ICAO Annex 3 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation, documents this obligation and defines the types of observations to be made, and the reporting and recording requirements.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-sanctioned program for automated weather observing systems on aircraft is called Aircraft Meteorological Data and Relay (AMDAR).  The current United States-based airline participants in Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System, MDCRS, (also called the more generic term, AMDAR) are American, Southwest, FedEx, United, UPS and Delta/Northwest.  At this time there are over 1500 aircraft reporting in the US program, with more than 100,000 observations down linked each day. The standards for the interfaces between the data link service providers and the airborne and ground-based users are defined in ARINC Specification 620-6, DataLink Ground System and Interface Specification. (Version 620-7 is currently in the draft development stage).The FAA has a requirement to collect these meteorological observations obtained from varied sensors on commercial aircraft and transmit these data in near-real time through the National Weather Service Telecommunications Gateway (NWSTG) to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for use in aviation weather analyses and forecasts.  NOAA facilities utilizing these data include the National Weather Service (NWS) in Silver Spring, Maryland and the Global Systems Division (GSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colorado.  The FAA also has a requirement to deliver aircraft-based weather observations and pilot report data to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado.  The data is used for product verification, evaluation, and as raw data for algorithm input.  In addition, the FAA  has a requirement for the capability to uplink NCAR message traffic to aircraft in flight. Finally, the FAA has a requirement to collect aircraft status change messages called OOOI (Out of gate, Off the ground, On the ground, In the gate) for US-based carriers. The collection and distribution of this data by the FAA forms the basis for the Daily Measurement of Air Traffic Services (DMATS) program. The Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) depends on OOOI data to determine the percent of on-time gate departures and arrivals, as well as taxi time and delays, airborne and block delays. These metrics are analyzed inside and outside the FAA. They are published daily for executive management to make tactical and strategic decisions (congestion management, for instance). OOOI data are also integrated into the computation of key efficiency metrics that serve as a basis for pay incentives, capital investments and NextGen scenario simulations. The FAA AWG is seeking to determine the availability of vendors with the capabilities, resources and qualifications to provide the operational services required to meet the following requirements.  Vendors interested in submitting a capability statement for this requirement must address all of the following:1.	Demonstrate knowledge of Air-Ground and Ground-Ground communications paths and ground-ground protocols among airlines participating in the US AMDAR program (currently American Airlines, Delta/Northwest Airlines, Federal Express, United Airlines, United Parcel Service, and Southwest Airlines).2.	Ability to provide near-real time data link service to participating airlines.3.	Ability to implement interface standards defined in ARINC Specification 620-6, DataLink Ground System and Interface Specification, and ability to incorporate any modifications that will be documented in version 620-7 when published.4.	Ability to communicate VHF D/L Service at over 200 domestic airport locations (list furnished upon request). 5.	Ability to provide network and service monitoring capability 24 hours per day, 7 days per week with the ability to respond any time a data link outage occurs.  6.	Ability to maintain field support network in the event remote maintenance is needed.7.	Ability to acquire AMDAR information from participating airlines by way of High Frequency, Very High Frequency or Satellite communications system.8.	Ability to process aircraft-based weather observations as defined in ICAO Annex 3 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation.9.	Ability to process the messages in such a way as to "strip off" the airborne meteorological data, and pass the messages in WMO FM-94 Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data (BUFR)  format to the FAA and NOAA.10.	Ability to provide a connection-oriented socket based data link capability with NCAR for data dissemination.  11.	Ability to provide a near real time uplink capability for NCAR product dissemination to participating airlines.12.	Ability to report aircraft status change messages called OOOI (Out of the gate, Off the ground, On the ground, In the gate) for aircraft at all airports serviced by participating US carriers.13.	Ability to provide immediate service so as to prevent a break in operational support.14.	Provide detailed information and past performance information on work performed that is similar to the work described in the "Background and Scope".15.	Interested parties are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request For Proposal (RFP).  Furthermore, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
This requirement is an amendment to Single Source Announcement No. 10079 posted on September 22, 2010.  The underlying requirement has not changed; the intent is to clarify the FAA's minimum needs, and this posting is a modification to the original announcement.  
For more than 30 years the Capacity Analysis Group, (CAG) based at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has used mathematical analysis and computer modeling to investigate air traffic congestion problems and to suggest possible solutions to those issues.  Fast-time simulation and modeling exercises are performed to examine system performance, including benefits assessment and the analysis of capacity, safety, risk and efficiency. The outcomes are beneficial to airports for planning purposes, and as performance metrics for the FAA in planning future NextGen capabilities.
	Recently, the CAG has identified a need to analyze simulation studies that are part of air traffic control training exercises conducted on simulators at 22 air traffic control towers around the country.  Each of these towers is equipped with a simulator used to train controllers on procedures specific to that airport.  As part of that training, instructors routinely introduce new procedures, problems and scenarios designed to challenge the controllers and measure and record their responses.  This technique provides actual, real-time, "human-in-the-loop" data that is valuable to the CAG in defining the actual, real-life limits of a given airport's capacity.  The CAG must have the unaltered, recorded playback of the simulations to capture responses, deviations, and mistakes of the simulation exercises, such as pilot interventions for missed approaches, go-around procedures, and other air traffic control procedures that were evaluated during the simulation.  Those simulations give the CAG the most accurate airport "layout" information available, along with the best information on how the controllers are actually operating.  This is critical because the CAG must ensure that the current system is optimized before it begins planning for NextGen.  
All 22 of the tower simulators in the towers are a software/hardware configuration provided by Adacel Corporation.  The recorded data containing all of the scenarios and reactions are captured on software using a code proprietary to Adacel.  The CAG needs to "export" the exact airport configuration data and imagery, airport scenario data, and playback data directly from the Adacel tower simulators, and "import" all of these data to a compatible simulator located at the Technical Center.  The CAG has determined that transferring these data in readable form from the airport towers to the Technical Center requires an "Adacel equivalent" tower simulation system compatible with the Adacel (ATC) Tower Simulator product, MaxSim 4.0 or higher. 
The CAG has limited staff and funding, and therefore it is a requirement to have a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution to satisfy its need.  Furthermore, it is also required that the simulation recording data not be an alteration or a reproduction of the data to ensure that the simulation is depicted accurately.  Likewise, the CAG cannot accept a solution that introduces a high-level, custom-designed gateway that may require future software upgrades, acquisition, and additional ownership costs.  The CAG has determined that only the Adacel equipment can meet the above requirements. 
The Capacity Analysis Group does not anticipate any future requirement for tower simulation systems beyond this acquisition. The acquisition is solely for research and development purposes and not for training purposes.   
For the above reasons, the FAA believes that competition is not appropriate for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience and the FAA will evaluate it.  All responses must be directed to the Contracting Officer, Mario Maccarone via email at Mario.Maccarone@faa.gov by 4:00 pm. EST, 11/3/2010.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for fire protection services and emergency response tosupport National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Johnson Space Center(JSC). This requirement has been fulfilled through the Safety and Fire Services Contract and wasintended to be transitioned to the NASA Agency-Wide Protective Services Contract (NPSC). The Safety and Fire Services Contract provided for not only fire protection services andemergency response but also supported the Centers safety programs, inspection of firesystems and upgrades and maintenance to those systems.	When the NPSC was created, it wasenvisioned that portions of the Safety and Fire Services contract were to transition tothe agency wide contract while the remaining Center unique activities were to be competedseparately. NASA JSC competed the remaining requirements in the 2008/2009 timeframe asthe Center Institutional Safety Services Contract (CISS) and awarded the contract toAnadarko Industries, LLC.  Recently, the NPSC activity was discontinued, so NASA/JSCintends to add this requirement to the existing CISS Contract.	Combining these activities into one contract will take advantage of synergies created bycombining the emergency response and fire protection services functions with theinstitutional safety functions currently covered by the scope of the CISS Contract andwill result in cost savings. For example, during off-peak hours, emergency responderswill be able to perform fire inspections, restock forms in buildings, and update the JSCgate signs, while still remaining available to quickly respond to any emergencies thatmay arise.  Having the fire protection system maintenance and emergency response underthe same contract will allow the contractor to manage the total effort and findefficiencies. The period of performance is anticipated to be January 1, 2011 through June30, 2012 with a two-year option from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2014. The primary work areas for this effort are the facilities at the NASA Johnson SpaceCenter, Houston, Texas; and related operations at Ellington Field (EF), Houston, Texas;and Sonny Carter Training Facility (SCTF) Houston, Texas. The Government does not believe that competing this effort is in its best interest. Acompetitive procurement would result in increased costs that are not expected to berecovered through competition.	The fire protection and emergency response work is sointegrally related to the work under the CISS contract that only this single source canreasonably perform this work.  The authorities cited permitting other than full and opencompetition are FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies orservices will satisfy agency requirements, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 2:30 p.m. local timeon November 1, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Cancer Institute (NCI() Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a sole source modification with the Advanced Biosciences Laboratory, Inc, of Kensington, Maryland. The existing contract has provided a facility for housing non-human primates and other standard laboratory animals under appropriate animal biosafety level 2 (BL2) conditions with animal biosafety level 3 (BL3) practices and procedures. Veterinary care and routine health surveillance have been provided for all animals. Technical and veterinary assistance for all routine procedures such as inoculations, bleedings, collection of mucosal secretions, biopsies, infection with pathogenic viruses, and implementing therapeutic regimen have also been provided. Clinical laboratory support services have been provided, and surgical procedures and complete post-mortem exams, including histological examination of tissues, have been carried out on study animals as required.
<p>The contractual history of the current contract began in the 1970's, first with the former Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, then the Basic Research Laboratory, and now the Vaccine Branch (VB), all in the National Cancer Institute. Historically, previous contracts provided immunological and virological support services for experiments carried out using animals under the contract. These included in vitro immunological assays in appropriate BL2/BL3 laboratories to characterize humoral or cellular immune responses following inoculation with viral antigens or virus infection and in vitro culture and detection of virus from peripheral blood and/or tissues or retrovirus-infected animals. The immunological and virological testing phases of the prior contract have been substantially removed. The scope of the current contract was expanded to include the purchase of non-human primates and temporarily to provide facilities for additional investigators in the VB. In addition, the contract screens non-human primates for various retroviruses and for a small panel of MHC haplotypes prior to acquisition, and conducts CD4/CD8 and complete blood counts. Otherwise, the current contract is solely for the purpose of provision and maintenance of non-human primates, and experimentation in animal model.<br />The proposed project is scaled back to provide facilities for non-human primate studies in the Section on Animal Model and Retroviral Vaccines and the Section on Immune Biology of Retroviral Infection of the VB. A base number of macaques will be requested with additional options for increasing animal numbers.</p>
<p>The planned modification will extend the period of performance of the current contract by 12 months, in order to provide continued contract performance until the award of a competitive acquisition for the follow-on requirement. Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, Only one Responsible Source. The contractor is uniquely qualified as follows:</p>
<p>1. Specialized staff with specific training for the care of non-human primates. <br />2. Specialized facilities and operations for the care and experimentation on non-human primates.</p>
<p>If this effort were awarded to another contractor the unacceptable delays would be experienced due to the quarantine time required in the transfer of animals, consequently resulting in unacceptable delays to the Government. In addition, the costs to move animals (special caging, trucking, physical examinations of all non-human primates) from one facility to the another is very expensive and would result in a duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. However, if there are sources who feel they may respond by submitting a capability statement (5 page limit) within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed modification, based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Elizabeth Shanahan, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Suite 600, Room 6064 MSC 7192 Bethesda, Maryland 20852. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may submit their capability statements via email in addition to 2 hard copies.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />6120 Executive Blvd.<br />EPS Suite 600<br />Rockville, Maryland 20852</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background: <br />Health care providers, health plans, quality improvement organizations, and other health care organizations and professionals embarking on quality improvement or disparities reduction activities frequently scan the field and networks for ideas or solutions that have worked elsewhere. Web sites, journal articles and other resources describing quality improvement strategies that work often chronicle them from a single initiative or setting. In addition, these information sources do not scan the full range of clinical to workforce to system design solutions, do not include innovative solutions or if they do lack sufficient information for replication, and do not permit readers to upload their own innovative solutions. Equally important, these information sources do not present solutions that didn't work, omitting an opportunity for those designing solutions to learn from efforts that were not successful. These, and other features, were deemed important and necessary by a panel of innovators and potential users of this Web site when the concept for the AHRQ Health Care&nbsp;Innovations Exchange was first vetted in 2005.<br /><br />For the first contract of the Health Care Innovations Exchange (HCIE), AHRQ envisioned it as a vehicle to promote the widespread diffusion of innovations that would lead to improvements in quality, efficiency and effectiveness and to reductions in disparities thereby contributing to AHRQ's progress in these strategic areas. In addition, the Web site would capture health system or practice innovations that were used (trialed, piloted, or incorporated enterprise-wide) and did not lead to the improvements of interest but may have lead to other positive findings and generated a number of lessons learned. Including this type of innovation would provide educational opportunities not available elsewhere. The research community would find this valuable also.<br /><br />The goal of the HCIE was, and continues, to be a publicly-accessible, national repository of health care service delivery innovations and tools and associated information needed to facilitate strategic decision making and to promote change and further innovation in the health care system for the purpose of improving health care quality and reducing health care disparities for all Americans. With this requirement, the Health Care Innovations Exchange will also become a national repository of policy/public health innovations used to improve&nbsp;quality and reduce disparities.&nbsp; Health Care Innovations Exchange will be the only national resource that will, when possible, draw relationships between policy/public health innovations and service delivery innovations. <br /><br />The HCIE is an Internet-based repository for the collection, classification, distribution of and dialogue around health care service delivery innovations and relation information and tools. The HCIE is a searchable database of innovative strategies and tools used to improve health care quality and reduce health care disparities. Learning and networking opportunities are offered to promote dialogue and exchange of information about innovation, adoption, spread and specific innovations and tools.<br /><br />While there are information technology (IT) components in this project, this is not an IT requirement. The project will be content driven supported by information technology.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />&bull; Continue the efficient, systematic collection, and high quality classification and representation of innovations and tools; continue to emphasize innovations targeting public health priority diseases/conditions, priority populations, and efforts to reduce disparities in quality; continue to maintain relationships with other databases (such as AHRQ's National Guideline Clearinghouse and National Quality Measures Clearinghouse)<br />&bull; Expand the database and resource to include policy/public health type innovations aimed at improving health care quality or reducing disparities in care; show parent-child relationships between policy innovations (parent) and clinical processes or community services innovations (child)<br />&bull; Operate and maintain, and develop, test, and deploy a back end and front end and related changes that reflect attention to the systems development life cycle, complies with relevant government IT regulations and requirements (such as privacy and security), and earns value for the government<br />&bull; Establish a project expert panel that will provide feedback and guidance, and to establish an editorial board with capacity to review submissions and write expert commentary critiquing innovation successes and failures, offering insights and addressing the nuances of innovation, implementation, and change<br />&bull; Continually improve the design of the Innovations Exchange incorporating feedback from user testing, expert panel, editorial board and others <br />&bull; Provide appropriate and timely technical assistance to users<br />&bull; Provide dynamic opportunities for learning and networking among the users of the Web site</p>
<p>Project Requirements: <br />There are five (5) major tasks associated with this requirement. Note: The list provided below is not exhaustive of all required subtasks.</p>
<p>Task 1 Content: Establish and maintain an editorial board; Recruit a group of experts; Modification of current inclusion criteria; Establishment of a system to obtain, publish, update, archive innovations, tools and associated content; and, Establish, implement, and maintain a system to index and abstract innovations and tools and validate that system.</p>
<p>Task 2 Enhancements: Propose recommendations for change to the inclusion criteria, copyright form, template of attributes, indexing, search, browse, verification, and publication.</p>
<p>Task 3 IT: Design, develop, test, deploy, and operate the Innovations Exchange technical infrastructure and web site.</p>
<p>Task 4 Learning and Networking: Propose options for providing learning and networking opportunities among Innovations Exchange users.</p>
<p>Task 5 Project Management: Provide for the effective and efficient management of the technical, administration, logistical, and support functions; Assist AHRQ with a customer satisfaction survey; Manuscript development; Use an Earned Value Management System in the management of the requirement; and, Reporting.</p>
<p>Capability statements should describe previous successes working with expert panels and editorial board(s) and with managing conflicts of interest. The Project team shall consist of a PMI-certified Project Manger. Other team members should have experiences in health services research; health care policy; clinical service delivery; community and social services relative to health care; health care quality improvement and/or disparities reduction; innovation and change management. Team members should be skilled at qualitative research; content capture, such as but not limited to investigative journalism; indexing and tagging using UMLS and other vocabularies; and systematic editorial processes and controls. In addition, some team members will have experiences in the IT life cycle and will be skilled at government database design/administration, government Web site design/deployment/maintenance, and obtaining system security certification and accreditation with an approval to operate in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: <br />The anticipated period of performance is July 27, 2011 - July 26, 2012 with four (4), one (1) year option periods from July 27, 2012 - July 26, 2016.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is ISSUED for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a solicitation is released. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Formal notices will be on http://www.fbo.gov/ website.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland AFB, TX is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for the next follow-on Independent Science, Engineering, and Acquisition Support (ISEAS) contract. This contract is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) of the highest technical degree, in extremely selective domains not relevant to AFCEE's large-scale A&amp;AS execution-leveraging, known as Global Engineering Integration and Technical Assistance (GEITA). AFCEE's ISEAS contract capability and needs have been and still are extremely limited with respect to volume (less than seven percent of AFCEE's overall A&amp;AS expenditures). AFCEE's ISEAS contract capability has existed since its earliest organizational days (early 1990s), and, since 1998, has been harnessed through four successive non-competitive direct award contracts under 10 U.S.C. 2304(3), as implemented in FAR 6.302.3 &lsquo;to maintain an essential capability provided by an educational or other non-profit institution or a federally funded research and development center'. Factors such as the specifics of this unique portion of AFCEE's overall A&amp;AS requirements, how they manifest themselves, the interactive stakeholder and operative domains prevalent in the requirements' framework, and, most importantly, the absolute need for renowned, universally credible highest technical operatives, mandates that AFCEE continue to harness an ISEAS capability such as it has for its entire tenure. In these relatively small areas of endeavor, AFCEE's ability to engage in and contribute to the success of DoD's programs that fall within its charter hinges on its access to and employment of a highest-level science and engineering arm which is totally independent in its corporate profile; totally free of organizational conflict with regards to other firms traversing AFCEE's and DoD's vast mission landscape; autonomous in how it receives, processes, and engages in the various tasks germane to its scope; totally non-competitive with regards to Government work; and accepted as bias-free, totally objective and immediately credible in how they exert their technically defensible contributions in support of AFCEE's mission. Accordingly, AFCEE anticipates a direct award (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee pricing arrangement, basic ordering period of three years with one additional year for completion of performance) pursuant to continuing the same ISEAS mission support objectives. The NAICS code for this work is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The program ceiling for this contract is estimated to be $20 million for the three year total spanning 2011 through 2013. Answers to the following questions will help AFCEE determine if a competitive environment has developed for this type of support contract.</p>
<p>AFCEE requests comments to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What are industry's experiences (i.e. your firm's experiences) supporting the types of technical functions and domains, in totality, prescribed in the attached PWS, and further addressed in the following questions, with the high technical levels of effort and resources necessary to fulfill AFCEE's needs relevant to the &lsquo;recognized expert', corporate autonomy, and conflict and bias-free nature of the ISEAS' independent standing and mission role?</p>
<p>2. If in your firm's profile, question # 1 seems to be covered (i.e. favorable), what is your firm's historical maximum work load and range of dispersion of work performed simultaneously? For whom did your firm provide these services, and under what type of contract?</p>
<p>3. If in your firm's profile, question # 1 seems to be covered (i.e. favorable), tell us how you would manage and perform the full scope of AFCEE's ISEAS requirements, including the manner of interaction with AFCEE and its customer and stakeholder base relevant to subject functions/domains and the associated requirements' manifestation (individual examples of technical functions/domains are portrayed in question numbers four through 10 below).</p>
<p>4. What are your firm's experiences in providing scientists, risk-assessors, and engineers considered leaders in their fields with reputations beyond reproach in supporting technical evaluation and transfer through independent engineering evaluation and assessment of technical data associated with the deployment of leading edge environmental technologies and controversial topics such as appropriate cleanup standards for environmental contaminants? If your firm has this experience and capability, has your firm done this work in the DoD ERA program, the MMRP, and the One Cleanup program? Has your firm conducted independent engineering evaluation and validation of DoD environmental needs, validating technology solutions and implementation plans? Has your firm provided education and training through outreach and partnerships? Has your firm worked in any of the various methods whereby Technology Transfer is accomplished: Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), restoration workshops, partnerships with industry/academia, and agreements such as the Interstate Technology Regulatory Council (ITRC) support per a DoD interagency agreement? Has your firm performed industrial oversight by reviewing and evaluating industry performance in environmental programs, reporting data, findings, results, and recommendations using high caliber experts, whose reputation in the field is impeccable, to avoid undue criticism, litigation and program delays, and fostering a confidence of total objectivity? In these endeavors, has your firm assisted your client by assessing and making recommendations on requirements pursuant to acquisition endeavors, crafting and reviewing Requests for Proposal, evaluation criteria, and other acquisition documents such as Broad Agency Announcements and the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (SERDP/ESTCP)?</p>
<p>5. What is your firm's expertise base and experiences in supporting emerging contaminants? Has your firm provided support to a client's such activities where chemical compounds, perchlorate, and other emerging issues and evolving contaminants were the topic of expertise? Similarly, has your firm provided specialized technical expertise and independent engineering and assessment for time-critical and/or new restoration-related requirements anticipated and/or relevant to the DoD.</p>
<p>6. What are your firm's experiences in assisting in a client's Technology Transfer Program? Has your firm identified, collected, analyzed, validated, and approved a client's environmental requirements using innovative conflict-free personnel for technology program and budget solutions, oversight and planning and execution? Similarly, does your firm possess the corporate standing and continuity to assist its client in these such endeavors as environmental needs change over time, as needs are identified and solutions are implemented, and as the flavor of the needs addressed through a Technology Transfer program changes over time, impacting budgetary and other programming aspects?</p>
<p>7. What are your firm's experiences in the forensic chemistry domain, as in providing the client with general and project-specific research and development support to identify and apply new and improved tools, diagnostics and methodologies in environmental forensic chemistry to augment initiatives in sampling, monitoring, characterization and system optimization?

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment,implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) willtake procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NASA nor the Government will beresponsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified parties interested in partnering withNASA in the research and development of its Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Projectthrough a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement. Responders to this RFI should haveexperience in one or more of the following fields: (1) inflatable technologies; (2)airlock technologies; (3) extravehicular suit technology.The HDU Project is an intelligent habitat operational prototype system for validatingtechnologies, operations, hardware, and software for sustainable, off-Earth livingquarters, workspaces, and laboratories for next-generation human exploration spacemissions. In order to reduce risk in the development of a Deep Space Habitat (DSH) thatwill be required to expand human exploration of asteroids, Lagrange points, the moon,Mars, and other destinations, habitat technologies must be validated in a variety ofmission scenarios and environments. The HDU Project employs a multi-center collaborativeteam that pulls together technologies, resources, people, and skills to contribute to aunique rapid prototype testing capability using a portable habitat testbed that can beset up in extreme environments to test integrated performance of operational scenarios,its systems, technologies, and interactions with other elements.The HDU Project has identified a need for a hybrid inflatable and hard shell suitlockthat can be used for planetary surface and deep space human exploration missions. Throughongoing analog studies at Desert Research and Technologies Studies (DRaTS) and in NASAsPrototyping Testbed Facility, it has been determined that a compact, deployable suitlockunit is needed to accommodate advanced Extravehicular Activity (EVA) egress and ingressoperations for various environments with only minor modifications. The HDU Projectintends to construct a medium-fidelity prototype suitlock unit that will be evaluated inanalog field testing, in conjunction with the Deep Space Habitat (DSH) hardware. No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.Contact: Questions concerning this RFI shall be submitted via email to Kriss J. Kennedy atkriss.j.kennedy@nasa.gov or by phone at 281-483-6629. Electronic submission of theresponses in Microsoft Office format or Adobe Acrobat versions 6 - 8 (.pdf) is due closeof business November 15, 2010, to kriss.j.kennedy@nasa.gov. Questions and responses shallreference this RFI. Please limit responses to 20 pages or less.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Calorically Restricted Rodents <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-146
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to continue to maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined, calorically restricted rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony was initially developed and maintained within controlled barrier environments where the environmental conditions are defined and the animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.<br />Caloric restriction, in which the calories are restricted to maintain a stable adult body weight but all other nutritional needs are met, is the only proven intervention to extend lifespan and improve health. Calorically restricted rodents are used to investigate the cellular and physiological biology of normal aging. A colony of aged, calorically restricted laboratory rodents, of defined genetic backgrounds and health status, is an integral part of the NIA's program of research on aging.</p>
<p>Under the current contract mechanism, the original expected duration of the colony is nine years, however, a two (2)-year extension was executed because the NIA needed more time to evaluate the use of the colony before deciding on renewal of this resource.</p>
<p>Development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase took approximately three (3) years. Once the breeding colony was up to its required size, animals began entering into the caloric restricted colony and entries are slated to continue through year 9 of the contract.</p>
<p><br />The animals are housed in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For these reasons, the existing colony cannot be transferred to a new Contractor.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the caloric restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br /><br />The Statement of Work consists of these major phases: A. Breeding Colony Development; B. Breeding Colony Maintenance; C. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D. Feeding Protocol; E. Environmental Requirements; F. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring, G. Shipment of Animals to Investigators; H. Cost of Animals to Investigators; and I. Reporting Requirements;</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire at the direction of the Project Officer breeding stock and shall re-derive the stock by cesarean section or embryo transfer. The Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. Foster mothers shall be of a strain that is easily distinguished from the NIA strains by both color and genetic markers.</p>
<p>II. Breeding Colony Maintenance</p>
<p>Re-derived foundation colony animals shall be entered into the barriers without contamination by pathogens or parasites and shall be maintained as such. Discrete space shall be provided for the breeding and aging colonies within each barrier. Breeding colony animals shall be removed from the barrier only for monitoring of genetic purity or colony health, or for other purposes as directed by the Project Officer. In both colony segments, no animals other than mice and rats shall be housed within the barrier and no other types of activity other than colony breeding and maintenance shall be permitted in the barrier rooms used to breed and maintain the NIA colony. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies. Breeding colony maintenance shall conform to the following requirements.</p>
<p><br />III. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony</p>
<p>A. Rodents shall be weaned at 3 - 4 weeks of age and shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth. Animals born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />B. Weaned rodents shall be housed individually and fed ad libitum until the commencement of the caloric restriction regimen. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall include the strain, gender, feeding protocol (AL or CR when assigned), and date of birth.</p>
<p>IV. Feeding Protocol</p>
<p>A. Ad libitum (AL) fed animals assigned to the aging colony shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount. The kind of ingredient shall be absolute; the percentage of the kinds of ingredients may vary dependent on nutrient content, provided the final formulation post-autoclaving remains consistent with NIH31 diet. NIH31 shall be made in random weight pellets appropriate for feeding mice and rats.</p>
<p>B. Calorically restricted (CR) animals shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet but is enriched 1.67-fold for all vitamins and minerals such that 40% restricted calorie intake provides 100% of the vitamin and mineral intake of ad libitum fed animals. This diet is called NIH31-Fortified. NIH31-Fortified shall be provided in known-weight pellets from 2.5 to 5.0 grams in 0.5 gram increments. The diet shall be of a consistency that prevents excessive crumbling of the pellets.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall measure food intake in the first cohort (DOB) of each strain and gender entered into the aging colony, to verify that food intake in the new colony is consistent with the levels on which the feeding protocol is based. Food intake shall be measured by providing an excess number of food pellets of known weight each day and weighing the food remaining the next day. Food intake shall be measured daily for the entire cohort from the age of 5 weeks through the age of 12 weeks. The data shall be compiled in an Excel spreadsheet and the up-dated spreadsheet shall be provided to the Project Officer weekly.</p>
<p>V. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p><br />VI. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, diet and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report. <br />B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. <br />C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p><br />VII. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />A. Animals from the aging calorically restricted rodent colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary for the animals, prepared under VI.B. above, shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VIII. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Animals produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each animal to the investigators shall be determined by the Project Officer. The current charge is $6.00 per month of age per mouse and $12.00 per month of age for rats; these costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs and the cost of food ordered. Current charges for food are $2.00 per Kg for NIH31, $10.00 per Kg for NIH31-Fortified, and a flat fee of $12.00 per food type per shipment if the food is shipped by truck with the animals. If food is shipped by common courier, the investigator will pay the prevailing rate.</p>
<p><br />IX. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>A. Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, genetic purity, environment or environmental control, and any differences noted between barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender, diet and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six-month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report, A weekly up-date of the food intake measurements during the initiation of the aging colony and a complete quarterly health monitoring reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term F-344 Rat Colony <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-147
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. This colony is intended to replace the existing aged F344 rat colony developed under NIA contract N01-AG-4-0008.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is ten years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Project Officer. During years 3 through 8, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 9 and 10, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 9 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year ten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be in helicobacter-negative barriers. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the agingcolony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development<br /><br />All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding rats and all rats entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government.</p>
<p>The numbers of breeding rats to be maintained shall be at a level that permits the entry to the aging colony of male and female weanling rats at the rate directed by the Project Officer. Each barrier shall house approximately one half, by age and gender, of all animals entered into the aging colony. The Government may alter the number of entries as research demands change during the performance period. Alterations in the number of rats entered require the specific written approval of the Contracting Officer. The initial aging colony entry levels shall be 1000 males and 300 females per month to be split approximately equally between the two barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />II. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>A. Rats shall be weaned at approximately 4 weeks of age and each rat shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth using codes specified by the Project Officer. Rats born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Weaned rats shall be separated by sex at weaning and held in lots of 2-5 animals per cage. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall be color coded by year to identify age cohorts. Recombination or consolidation of cages is prohibited unless approved in writing by the COTR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p><br />IV. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on rats unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. Selection of animals for monitoring shall be evenly divided between colony segments and represent both genders. Thirty (30) rats shall be submitted for routine health monitoring each quarter unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer. Shipping and laboratory fees shall be chargeable to the contract. Rats to be submitted for routine monitoring shall be a minimum of 4 months old. Approximately half of the rats tested each quarter shall be 4-12 months old and the other half 12-20 months old. The schedule for health monitoring shall be developed by the Contractor and shall require the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p><br />V. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />A. Animals from the aging F344 rat colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary prepared under V.B. above for the animals shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VI. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Rats produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each rat to the investigators, consisting of a basic acquisition cost plus a maintenance charge determined by age of the rat at shipment, shall be determined by the Project Officer. These costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs. Total cost (as charged to the consignee) of animals (acquisition, maintenance, crate, water source and shipping charge) which are not useable when received by the consignee due to negligence on the part of the Contractor or subcontractors, shall be borne by the Contractor and are not chargeable to the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, environmental control, genetic purity, or any differences noted between the barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report shall be submitted to the Project Officer in accordance with a format approved by the Project Officer. Electronic transfer of the census in Excel spreadsheet format is the preferred means. The weekly census report is due to the Project Officer no later than one week (7 calendar days) from date of census. Access to a "real-time" electronic inventory may take the place of the weekly census report subject to approval by the Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with existing standing colonies of aged, genetically defined F344 rates for use by investigators in studies of aging, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified F344 rat colony; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Mutant Mouse Lines <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-149
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mutant mice of defined genotypes, including genetically engineered and spontaneously arising mutations, for use by investigators in studies of aging. The word &lsquo;mutant' is used here to refer to transgenic, knockout and spontaneously arising mutant genotypes. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. Each line of mice will be characterized for the specific mutation and control animals will be provided for some lines where needed. This contract will replace the existing colony developed under contract N01-AG-4-0009.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mice of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this contract is eleven years. Four lines were obtained and it is estimated that between 300 and 600 mice per year will be entered into the aging colony for each line.</p>
<p>&bull; Ames Dwarf <br />&bull; Snell Dwarf <br />&bull; C57BL/6-tg (UBC-GFP)30Scha/J <br />&bull; B6;C3H-Tg (Prnp-SNCA)M83/Vle Tac</p>
<p><br />Animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators, such that young animals enter the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period of the contract will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the end of year 9 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population will decline over the final two years of the contract to a point of few animals at the end of year 11.</p>
<p>The colony shall be maintained behind two independent barriers, specific pathogen- and parasite- free, for the entire contract period. The two barriers do not need to be geographically separated. Both barriers shall specifically be helicobacter-negative. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Supply of the Mouse Genotype</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall acquire the genotypes specified by the Project Officer and shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of each of these genotypes which serve as the progenitors for the mice in the aging colony. All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding mice and all mice entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government. Acquisition of lines for this contract colony does not confer any rights to the Contractor to commercialize the lines. The Contractor shall not commercialize any lines of mice acquired for or under this contract.</p>
<p>II Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. Mating, isolation, and primary enclosures shall meet or exceed minimum floor space requirements per mouse, and population size per cage as stated in the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html/index.html). All primary enclosures and bedding type shall require the prior approval of the Project Officer. Mating cages shall be numbered consecutively.<br />B. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space within the barriers for the breeding and aging colonies. The barrier systems or isolation rooms shall be constructed and operated to effectively exclude pathogens, ecto-, endo-parasites as well as vermin.</p>
<p><br />III. Breeding Colony</p>
<p>The foundation animals for each breeding colony shall be re-derived by cesarean section or embryo transfer, shall be entered from isolators into the barrier system without contamination by pathogens or parasites, and shall be maintained as such. The Contractor shall provide discrete space within the rederivation area for the lines and shall not house other animals within the isolators other than this contract's mice and their foster mothers. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies.</p>
<p><br /><br />IV. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>Mice shall be weaned at approximately 3 to 4 weeks of age and shall be group housed in the aging colony with a maximum of 5 mice per cage. Generally, same sex littermates will be housed together or same sex non-littermates of the same line of mice and born within a week of each other may be housed together. Specific housing protocols may be specified by the Project Officer, such as for dwarf mutant mice that require wild-type mice in the cage in order to maintain body temperature. All offspring from the breeding colony shall be entered into the aging colony unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V. Colony Evaluation, Characterization and Monitoring</p>
<p>All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by strain, sex, barrier and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on mice unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the animals were sent for evaluation. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences in mortality between lines shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. Numbers of each genotype, sex and barrier submitted for monitoring shall be determined by the Project Officer. Up to fifty (50) mice total shall be submitted for routine health monitoring each quarter unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer. Specimens from the colonies of mice used to generate foster mothers shall also be submitted for health monitoring each quarter.<br />C The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI. Shipment of Animals to Investigators<br /><br />Animals from the aging mouse colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as specified by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary for the animals, prepared under V.B. above, and a copy of the genotyping results for the animals shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p><br />VII. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>Mice produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each mouse to the investigators, a basic acquisition cost plus a maintenance charge determined by age of mouse, shall be determined by the Project Officer. Initial costs are expected to be $20.00 plus $5.00 per month of age, per mouse. These costs will be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs. Total cost (as charged to the consignee) of animals (acquisition, maintenance, crate and shipping) which are not useable when received by the consignee due to negligence on the part of the contractor or subcontractors, shall be borne by the Contractor and are not chargeable to the Government.</p>
<p><br />Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with existing standing colonies of aged, genetically defined F344 rates for use by investigators in studies of aging, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified F344 rat colony; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Hybrid Rats <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-148
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid (F344BN F1) rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. This colony is intended to replace the existing aged colony developed under NIA contract N01-AG-5-0006.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged BN and F344BN F1 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is nine years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Project Officer. During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year 9.</p>
<p><br />This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be in helicobacter-negative barriers. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment shall be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />More specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire, when necessary, F344 and BN breeding stock as directed by the Project Officer. All animals obtained for this contract and produced under this contract, including all breeding rats and all rats entered into the aging colonies, shall be the property of the Government.</p>
<p>The foundation animals for each colony segment shall be re-derived by cesarean section or embryo transfer, shall be entered from isolators into the barrier system without contamination by pathogens or parasites, and shall be maintained as such. The Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. Discrete space within the re-derivation area shall be provided for re-derivation of the rats. No other animals shall be housed within an isolator housing the rats from this contract, other than this contract's animals and foster mothers. Foster mothers shall be of a strain that is easily distinguished from the F344 and BN rats by both color and genetic markers. Health monitoring shall be performed on the colony of rats to be used as foster mothers within sixty (60) days before the initiation of re-derivation and the results of that monitoring shall be provided to the Project Officer within ten (10) calendar days of receipt by the Contractor. This health monitoring shall specifically include helicobacter status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II Breeding Colony Maintenance</p>
<p>Discrete space shall be provided for the breeding and aging colonies within each segment barrier. Breeding colony animals shall be removed from the barrier only for monitoring of genetic purity or colony health, or for other purposes as directed by the Project Officer. In both colony segments no other types of animals other than mice or rats and no other types of activity other than colony maintenance and breeding shall be permitted in the barrier rooms used to breed and maintain the rat colony as specified. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies. Breeding colony maintenance shall conform to the following requirements.</p>
<p><br />III. Maintenance of the Aging Colony</p>
<p>A. Rats shall be weaned at approximately 4 weeks of age and each rat shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth using codes specified by the Project Officer. Rats born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Weaned rats shall be separated by sex at weaning and held in lots of 2-5 animals per cage. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards will be color coded by year to identify age cohorts. Recombination or consolidation of cages is prohibited.</p>
<p><br />IV. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V. Colony Evaluation, Characterization and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed on rats that die within the colony unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. Selection of animals for monitoring shall be evenly divided between colony segments and represent both genders. Thirty (30) rats shall be submitted for routine health monitoring each quarter unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer. Shipping and laboratory fees shall be chargeable to the contract. Rats to be submitted for routine monitoring shall be a minimum of 4 months old. Approximately half of the rats tested each quarter shall be 4-12 months old and the other half 12-20 months old. The schedule for health monitoring shall be developed by the Contractor and shall require the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI. Shipment of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p>A. Animals from the aging rat colony shall be distributed to investigators or laboratories only as directed by the Project Officer or the designated representative of the Project Officer. A copy of the most recent Health Evaluation Summary prepared under V.B. above for the animals shall be sent with each order.</p>
<p>VII. Cost of Animals to Investigators</p>
<p><br />Rats produced under this contract shall be made available to investigators under conditions as stated herein or as otherwise specified by the Project Officer. The cost of each rat to the investigators, consisting of a basic acquisition cost plus a maintenance charge determined by age of the rat at shipment, shall be determined by the Project Officer. These costs shall be subject to annual adjustment. The consignee is also responsible for all shipping costs. Total cost (as charged to the consignee) of animals (acquisition, maintenance, crate, water source and shipping charge) which are not useable when received by the consignee due to negligence on the part of the Contractor or subcontractors, shall be borne by the Contractor and are not chargeable to the Government.</p>

<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ISSUED BY THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (NRL) FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. HOWEVER, RESPONSES MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR A FUTURE ACQUISITION.</p>
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Space Science Division (Code 7600), is requesting information and ROM estimate of cost for providing an Engineering Model (EM) and spaceflight qualified CCD detectors and detector electronics for the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) that will be part of an instrument suite aboard a proposed NASA EXPLORER spaceflight mission. The MDI instrument will consist of two similar units that will measure upper atmospheric winds along one line of sight each. One CCD camera is required for each of the two MDI units. One CCD camera is comprised of the cooled CCD, front-end electronics, radiation shield, mechanical structure, and required interfaces. The specifications referenced herein are export controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As such, in order to receive the referenced specifications, potential Customers must complete the attached certification with proof of status as a U.S. Person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15) and submit via email to Ms. Lisa Fleming, at <a href="mailto:lisa.fleming@nrl.navy.mil">Lisa.Fleming@nrl.navy.mil</a>. Upon confirmation of eligibility, potential offerers will be sent draft copies of the Statement of Work and specifications. The Statement of Work and specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations. Technical questions shall be directed to Dr. Christoph R. Englert, NRL Code 7641 via email <a href="mailto:christoph.englert@nrl.navy.mil">Christoph.Englert@nrl.navy.mil</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gauge industry interest, capabilities, and relevant heritage experience and know-how for providing the MDI CCD camera. It is the goal of NRL to maximize heritage experience and know-how and to minimize risk and cost to the MDI program. As such NRL will be using the responses and ROM cost estimates for determination of whether to procure the requirement via a formal contract or to build part or all of the hardware in-house. If NRL decides to procure this hardware, one or two EM CCD camera would need to be delivered in mid-2013, two flight CCD cameras and one flight spare CCD camera delivered in mid-2014. Examples of what key evaluation criteria might be included: 1) Relevant corporate and key personnel heritage experience and know-how, 2) Hardware performance from past programs, 3) Cost/cost realism, 4) Schedule. If a solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that it will call for a three phase hybrid contract: with Phase 1 awarded on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis that will continue through completion of Phase A (CCD camera specification refinement); Phase 2 awarded on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis that will cover from the start of Phase B through CDR (EM CCD camera development and delivery); and, Phase 3 awarded on a fixed price basis that will span from CDR through delivery of the flight and flight spare CCD cameras.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit the information requested herein, as well as, a ROM/cost estimate.</p>
<p>This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of NRL to acquire any products or services. The NRL does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. Submission of a response to this RFI is voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the NRL to pay or entitle the submitter to any compensation. All information and data received in response to this RFI that are marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be protected as such. Responses to this RFI may be submitted in writing or by email no later than 4PM EDT <strong>November 5, 2010</strong>.</p>
<p>Information may be submitted to:</p>
<p>Naval Research Laboratory<br />4555 Overlook Avenue<br />ATTN: Christoph Englert, Code 7641<br />Washington, D.C. 20375</p>
<p>Or UNCLASS email: <a href="mailto:Christoph.englert@nrl.navy.mil">Christoph.Englert@nrl.navy.mil</a></p>

<DESC>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SOUGHT
REQUIREMENT:
The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in El Paso, Texas, that has a requirement for expansion. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,088 contiguous rentable square feet of medical office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,690 contiguous net usable square feet (USF). The lease term requirement is for 3 years firm with 5 (five) 1-year options. The space must be available for occupancy by January 22, 2011. The delineated area is the City Limits of El Paso, Texas.
Other applicable requirements include:
"	Parking: 
On-site parking for at least thirty five (35) reserved parking spaces in which six (6) should be designated as handicapped or minimum number of spaces required by local codes.

"	Others:
The space can be provided by modification of existing space. 
All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning, and required alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. 
The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

Construction magnitude is between $250,000 and $500,000.  A bid bond of 20%, as well as 100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000.<BR><BR>This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify concerns with the capability to accomplish the work.  This is not a solicitation.  Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside this requirement.  <BR><BR>Please submit<BR>1) A statement of your firms current or past technical experience similar to or the same as the following Summary Scope of Work.<BR><BR>2) A statement of your firms current or past performance similar to or the same as the following Summary Scope of Work.<BR><BR>3) A statement of your firms bonding capacity.<BR><BR>4) A statement of your firms business size and type (HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), woman-owned).<BR><BR>Submit this information to Elaine Vandiver, Contract Specialist, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, Washington 99362; or via email to Elaine.M.Vandiver@usace.army.mil.  Your response to this notice must be received on or before 12:00PM on OCTOBER 25, 2010.<BR><BR>Summary of Scope of Work<BR><BR>This job consists of removal of vegetation, debris, and sediment from within the dam forebay for maintenance purposes.  Removal will occur in two adjacent areas and will include installation of a temporary road and bridge to allow for excavation equipment access to the areas.  One area is approximately 500 feet in length and is approximately 50 feet each side of an existing crib and cable debris barrier. Thirty (30) feet each side of the barrier would be excavated down to elevation 1257 feet, the outward edge of the excavation area is to be on a 1 foot vertical to 3 foot horizontal cut slope, and required to daylight to existing ground.  The second area is approximately 250 feet in length, a strip approximately 20 feet in width, which runs parallel with the upstream face of the diversion dam.  The excavation would begin at approximate elevation 1247 nearest the dam face to 20 feet upstream.  The upstream edge of excavation area is to be on a 1 foot vertical to 3 foot horizontal cut slope, and required to daylight to existing ground elevation.  An estimated 3,000 - 5,000 cubic yards of sediment would be removed.  The temporary road is approximated to be 650 feet long, 12 feet wide, and with a 4 inch surface layer of gravel.  A temporary bridge structure is required for access over the existing channel in order to reach both ends of the barrier structure.  This is a meandering creek channel and varies in width and location due to annual flows.  In addition, this work requires a fish retention net to be installed upstream of the project work site and fish removed from the project site prior to sediment removal.  Pre, during, and post construction turbidity monitoring will be required.  All in-water work activities will be required to occur between July 15 and August 15, 2011.<BR><BR>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Documents/EM385-1-1FINAL.pdf.

<p><br />H.17 NAVSEA 5252.223-9114 MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE (NOV 1996)<br />(a) GENERAL<br />(1) The Contractor shall comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 10 U.S.C. 7311 and all other applicable Federal, State and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations for the management and disposal of hazardous waste.<br />(2) Nothing contained in this special contract requirement shall relieve the Contractor from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local Laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations, including obtaining licenses and permits, giving notices and submitting reports, in connection with hazardous waste management and disposal in the performance of this contract. Nothing contained herein shall serve to alter either party's liability or responsibility under CERCLA.<br />(3) Materials contained in ship systems are not waste until after removal from the system.<br />(b) IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES<br />Work Item 077-01-001 of this contract identifies the types and amounts of hazardous wastes that are required to be removed by the Contractor, or that are expected to be generated, during the performance of work under this contract.<br />(c) GENERATOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS<br />(1) Documentation related to hazardous waste generated solely by the physical actions of ship's force or Navy employees on board the vessel shall only bear a generator identification number issued to the Navy pursuant to applicable law.<br />(2) Documentation related to hazardous waste generated solely by the physical actions of Contractor personnel shall only bear a generator identification number issued to the Contractor pursuant to applicable law. Regardless of the presence of other materials in or on the shipboard systems or structures which may have qualified a waste stream as hazardous, where the Contractor performs work on a system or structure using materials (whether or not the use of such materials was specified by the Navy) which by themselves would cause the waste from such work to be a hazardous waste, documentation related to such waste shall only bear a generator identification number issued to the Contractor.<br />(3) Documentation related to hazardous waste generated by the combined physical actions of Navy and Contractor personnel shall bear a generator identification number issued to the Contractor pursuant to applicable law and shall also cite in the remarks block a generator identification number issued to the Navy pursuant to applicable law.<br />(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) (1) - (c) (3) above, hazardous wastes are considered to be co-generated in cases where: (a) the Contractor merely drains a system and such drainage creates hazardous waste or (b) the Contractor performs work on a system or structure using materials which by themselves would not cause the waste from such work to be hazardous waste but such work nonetheless creates a hazardous waste. Documentation related to such co-generated waste shall bear a generator identification number in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) (3) above.<br />(5) In the event of a failure by the parties to agree to the assignment of a generator identification number to any hazardous waste as set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (c) (4) above, the Government may direct which party or parties shall provide generator identification numbers for the waste and such number(s) shall be used on all required documentation. Any disagreement with this direction shall be a dispute within the meaning of clause of this contract entitled "DISPUTES" (FAR 52.233-1). However, the Contractor shall not stop any work but shall continue with performance of all work under this contract as specified in the "DISPUTES" clause.<br />(6) Hazardous Waste Manifests for wastes described in (c) (2), (c) (3), and (c) (4) above (and (c) (5) as applicable), the Contractor shall sign the generator certification on the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest whenever use of the Manifest is required for disposal. The Contractor shall obtain concurrence with the categorization of wastes under paragraphs (c) (3) and (c) (4) above before completion of the manifest. Manifests prepared pursuant to paragraph (c) (1) above shall be presented to the SUPERVISOR for completion after the hazardous waste has been identified.<br />(7) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) herein, if the Contractor, while performing work at a Government facility, cannot obtain a separate generator identification number from the State in which the availability will be performed, the Contractor shall notify the SUPERVISOR within 3 business days of receipt of written notification by the State. After obtaining the SUPERVISOR'S approval, the Contractor shall use the Navy site generator identification number and insert in the remarks block the contractor generator identification number issued for the site where his main facilities are located. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) herein, if the work is being performed at a contractor facility and the Government cannot obtain a separate generator identification number for the State, the Government shall use the Contractor site generator identification number and shall cite in the remarks block a Navy generator identification number. In both instances described above, the Contractor shall prepare the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest described in paragraph (c) (6) above and present it to the SUPERVISOR for completion.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items using simplified acquisition procedures and prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>The full text of Request for Quotation (RFQ) RFQ-NCI-10009-AS may be accessed through the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Office of Acquisitions homepage by using the following internet address - http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/index.jsp. (Please click on Current Request for Proposals to access). Only electronic copies of the solicitation are available. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the solicitation and any amendments. POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS. No collect calls will be accepted.</p>
<p>This project is funded thorough the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.</p>
<p>It is anticipated this solicitation will result in multiple awards.</p>
<p>Awards resulting from this solicitation No. RFQ-NCI-10009-AS will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect at the time of award for commercial items using simplified procedures.</p>
<p>Under this RFQ, the offeror shall provide clinically annotated biospecimens to TCGA for the following cancer types: Thyroid follicular carcinoma, Thyroid papillary carcinoma, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (ex Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Other Cancer Types Currently Not Identified.</p>
<p>The NCI is expanding its basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on sufficient availability of high quality well annotated biospecimens suitable for use in genomic studies. The NCI's overarching goal with such programs is to improve the ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), one such program, is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. The NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched TCGA as a 3-year pilot project in 2006, and have since (August 2009) initiated the second phase of the project to study at least 20 additional cancers over 5 years. This project aims to systematically explore the entire spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer. Specifically, the project is designed to comprehensively analyze DNA copy number changes, including large (on the order of chromosome segments) and small (1,000-100,000 kb) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA. The suite of analysis platforms will be applied to a common set of molecular analytes obtained from clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens and case-matched normal tissue (control). More detailed information can be found at the project's website: http://cancergenome.nih.gov. To successfully generate comprehensive data in phase two, TCGA will need in excess of 40,000 biospecimens over course of the project.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates four DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft will be based out of the Hyannis, MA area to be operated in support of critical marine mammal surveys, law enforcement and marine sanctuary related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Hyannis area, it is necessary that the Twin Otter aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period December 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. The hangar will protect the aircraft from the environment as well as protect the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>Scope: <br />NOAA Twin Otter aircraft will be operating out of Hyannis, MA in support of marine mammal surveys in the Atlantic Ocean. There will be a NOAA Twin Otter mechanic in Hyannis supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one Twin Otter is required in the hangar at one time. However, if maintenance or equipment installation is required, there may be a request to shift one aircraft out on the ramp to allow another one access.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) DHC-6 Twin Otter having a wing span of 65 feet and 19 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security clause 1352.239-73 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1)Ground support equipment use including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)DC external power unit,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b)Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)Tow vehicle for aircraft movement in and out of hangar. <br />2)Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, heat&nbsp;&nbsp; and DC power,<br />3)24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4)Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />5)Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from December 1, 2010 thru March 31, 2011. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than March 31, 2011. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-46.  This action is set-aside for small businesses, NAICS 325320, Exterminating Chemical Products Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  Note that non-manufacturer small businesses must offer the product of a small business to qualify for the set-aside.

BACKGROUND Antimycin was the preferred product for use in fish eradication projects at North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA) in accordance with the Mountain Lakes Fishery Management Plan/EIS.  This purchase is a re-procurement of piscicide previously advertised and awarded as Q/P9475095038 for antimycin; that purchase was terminated for convenience due to non-availability of the product.  Our only other option is to use a product with rotenone as the active ingredient.

<RESPDATE>110410
<CONTACT>Winnie Hinga, Email WHinga@usaid.gov - Ketan Sood, Regional Acquisition & Assistance Specialist, Email ksood@usaid.gov
<DESC>1.	BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION
<p>The essential functions of the Senior Health Advisor at USAID DRC are twofold: first, to advise Mission Management and represent the Mission in host-country, donor and inter-agency coordination on health sector strategy, policy reform and program planning, monitoring and evaluation; and second, to manage the Mission's Health Office during extended periods of absence or vacancy of the Supervisory Health Officer (US Direct Hire, USDH).  Subject to approval of USAID/Washington, the necessary waivers will be obtained to empower the incumbent with supervisory authorities otherwise reserved for USDH.</p>
<p>The Senior Health Advisor will have the responsibility to help strengthen and advance health sector reform and development in the Congolese context and will serve as a key technical expert, resource and program manager for activities under the rapidly growing Health portfolio.  Responsibilities may include a full range of management, planning, program design, advisory, and administrative functions for health-related activities.</p>
<p>The Senior Health Advisor will report to the Mission Director on policy and technical matters, and on management and coordination issues.  As a senior-level advisor and technical expert, s/he will also exercise significant independent judgment on matter of policy and technical direction and will make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.  Moreover, s/he may be required to provide policy analysis and options as requested by senior Mission management and other U.S. Government officials through Mission management.  The Senior Health Advisor will also represent USAID, as requested and appropriate, at meetings with Congolese officials and technical counterparts, donors, non-governmental organizations, beneficiaries, and implementing partner staff.</p>
<p>The work is challenging because of the complex social, political, and security environment in which USAID implements its activities in the DRC.  The Senior Health Advisor must be able to rapidly assimilate, analyze and respond to rapidly changing circumstances and help guide USAID projects to achieve optimal results.  S/he must be proactive and innovative in bringing state-of-the-art technical practices to Congolese development context.  Cross-cultural communications, cultural sensitivities, and outstanding communication and interpersonal skills are essential for success.</p>
<p>2.	DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Senior Health Advisor serves as the senior technical and policy analyst in this sector and contributes directly to policy and planning decisions.

<p>-	Establish and maintain strong and effective working relations and coordination with senior level representatives and technical leaders from a wide range of stakeholders including the DRC's Ministry of Health and other local institutions, implementing partners (contractors and grantees), donor organizations, United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa and USAID Washington (e.g. Global Health Bureau, Africa Bureau, Food for Peace Program).</p>
<p>-	In consultation with Mission Management, advise U.S. Embassy Kinshasa, senior USAID Washington personnel and technical offices, and the Government of the DRC regarding key health development-related issues affecting policy, strategic planning, technical advice, programming, activity design, budgeting, implementation, monitoring, managing for results, and other USAID program management matters.</p>
<p>-	Collaborate with the Inter-Agency HIV/AIDS PEPFAR Coordinator, the Global Fund Liaison and the Inter-Agency Malaria Program Coordinator.</p>
<p>-	Represent USAID in donor coordination meetings and technical working groups and contribute to leadership of multi-actor coordination activities.</p>
<p>-	Represent USAID DRC at local, regional and international meetings/seminars/conferences, and via conference calls and correspondence, as related to health issues.</p>
<p>b.	Health Office Management and Supervision</p>
<p>Manage the Mission's Health Office during extended periods of absence or vacancy of the Supervisory Health Officer:</p>
<p>-	When serving as Health Office Team Leader, provide guidance and substantive inputs in the formulation of USG policy and strategy involving the achievement of Health and social development objectives.</p>
<p>-	S/He leads supervision of the Health program's budgeting, planning, design, procurement, implementation, evaluation and monitoring, as well as reporting</p>
<p>-	Manage and assume responsibiltiy for the performance monitoring and evaluation of current activities, as well as the conceptualization, design and implementation of new health activities that respond to the Congo's extremely fluid political environment.</p>

<p>-	Directly supervise, recruit and plan for the professional development of USDH, Fellows and FSNs, setting work objectives, balancing workloads, and offering technical and administrative guidance as needed.  Serve on evaluation and performance review committees and provide 360 feedback for colleagues and subordinates at post.</p>
<p>-	S/He participates in the Health working group responsible for the development of relevant portions of the Operational Plan; coordinating with other U.S. Government agencies on program planning and implementation issues; and participating  on various selection/planning/management committees.</p>
<p>-	Contribute to the preparation of the Annual Report, CBJ, strategic planning documents, results frameworks, performance monitoring plans, reports, budgets, activity reviews, activity approval memoranda, checklists and success stories related to Health programs.</p>

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract.

<p><br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)<br />2100 Second Street, SW<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202)267-2285<br />FAX: (202)267-4011</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to provide a market analysis that will determine the most likely products and clients for the new facility and establish a Master Plan based on identified demand.</p>
<p>The existing infrastructure in Ceara is not able to meet the state's growing cargo demand. The runway at the Pinto Martins International Airport is not long enough to support cargo flights and there is no room to add cargo capability. Additionally, the airport has limited connectivity with Ceara's main port, the Port of Pecem. Brazil's two main cargo airports are located in the southeast of the country. As such, most air cargo traffic in the Northeast is rerouted through Sao Paulo in the Southeast, which is a 3 &frac12; hour flight from Fortaleza. This not only increases transportation costs for most goods, but also increases risk for perishable products.</p>
<p>The objective of the Study is to establish an implementation plan for a new air cargo facility that will complement the expansion currently underway at the port and increase the efficiency of air cargo. A new cargo airport would provide the infrastructure necessary to allow for a greater number of direct routes to and from Ceara and foster multimodality between the port, rail and road systems. ADECE is the State Government agency responsible for implementing policies and projects that foster industrial, commercial, and technological development in the state</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $480,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Portuguese and English directly to the Grantee by 1:00 pm (local time), December 2, 2010 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response and risk reduction programs. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor is part of the Technical Assistance Group.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor is an integral member of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) TAG Team. USAID/OFDA DRR activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor who will work with OFDA technical experts to develop disaster risk reduction strategies for OFDA programming. This will include leading the design of community-based disaster risk reduction strategies, coordinating transition from emergency assistance to development programming, monitoring of DRR activities, and providing representation at international forums.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Disaster Risk Reduction Advisor will be based in Washington, D.C. The duties and responsibilities are:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the focal point within USAID/OFDA for Disaster Risk Reduction programs and activities; contribute to the development and communication of appropriate DRR strategies and policies for OFDA and the U.S. Government (USG) in disaster and emergency-response;</p>
<p>&bull; Assess priority countries for DRR interventions; initiate and lead the discussion of needs and demands of these priority countries in the area of disaster risk reduction; provide leadership and technical input for the design, development, and implementation of disaster risk reduction activities at the national and regional levels, including the formulation of national and regional capacity building programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Engage with the technical experts on USAID/OFDA's technical assistance group (TAG) to develop and integrate thematic programs related to risk identification, capacity development, climate risk management, urban risk management and gender within each sector to ensure that DRR programming is technically sound, gender-sensitive, sustainable, and within OFDA's mandate;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the OFDA Regional Teams and TAG, review DRR proposals for appropriateness for OFDA funding, and identify areas where DRR can build upon ongoing disaster response and/or development programming; assist regional teams and technical leads in assessing gaps and needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop increased awareness of disaster risk reduction strategies and activities within USAID/OFDA and other offices and bureaus, including through training;</p>
<p>&bull; Organize and/or substantively contribute to discussions on disaster risk reduction policy initiatives, including lessons learned and evaluations of the experience of various international organizations in disaster risk reduction;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent USAID/OFDA on policy, strategy and technical matters related to DRR in inter-agency, regional and international meetings; present USAID/OFDA position on disaster reduction and recovery issues, and relevant policies, strategies, results and lessons learned in workshops, seminars and conferences;</p>
<p>&bull; Support regional advocacy efforts related to the promotion, adoption and endorsement of disaster risk reduction strategies;</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate internal advocacy efforts related to mainstreaming disaster reduction into USAID-supported development initiatives;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage the production and dissemination of both regular and occasional reports on USAID/OFDA activities in disaster risk reduction; prepare evidence to support increased investment in DRR through cost-benefit analyses;</p>
<p>&bull; With input from OFDA/Office of the Director, undertake working level negotiations with counterparts in multi and bilateral agencies; coordinate with international donors, NGOs, UN agencies, and other regional, national, and local partners to promote the implementation of DRR activities in disaster-prone regions;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as requested on field assessment missions, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs);</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as DCHA/OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The DRR Advisor will take direction from and report to the Technical Assistance Group (TAG) Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The DRR Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The TAG Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals, objectives and functions.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12. START DATE: Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>
<p>13. POINT OF CONTACT: See Cover Letter.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(2) By the end of the month following the month of a contract award, and annually thereafter, the Contractor shall report the names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated executives for the Contractor's preceding completed fiscal year at http://www.ccr.gov, if--</p>
<p>(i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received--</p>

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

Response to Request for Information
-On the chair set-up will we need to put armour deck under all chair placement?  No Chairs will go directly on the turf-Will ganging of the chairs be necessary?   No -How close to the site can we bring the semis into?  Vehicles can pull onto the Grey gravel road on the drawings to offload and load-Is there a designated staging area to go to for the semis? There is no staging area, we schedule loading and off loading time with all vendors for gravel roadway access-If possible can we find out the height of the stage so I can make sure to use the correct wheelchair lift.  Also will this be in the grass or on pavement? The stage will be finalized this week, it is looking like 5'6" right now- In order to install the generators safely and in compliance with code, we will need to install ground rods at each generator. Will you be able to provide us with a location where we can drive the ground rods without damaging any underground utilities? Yes, we will provide locations for grounding rods-Will the pipe and drape be placed inside a tent our outside. inside-Will a stage be required? no-What height must the wheelchair lift reach to? Between 5'6" and 6'6" final stage height has not been finalized-Are we responsible to secure permits for electricity, tents and heaters or will the NPS take care of that? NPS responsibility-Are there any special requirements for the propane heaters such as distance away from each tent, securing of propane tanks, maximum tank size and etc? no-What type of heaters will you need for the stage area? I would assume you are looking for radiant patio heaters. Is that correct. The stage has not been finalized, if it is the same as in years past, it is the same heater vent as in a tent, if the stage changes, the heater may be removed from the project-I have a questions on this paragraph in the solicitation: "To include pickup and delivery, set up, electrician to provide power distribution to all tents and to include all necessary electrical equipment such as breakout panels, electrical cables, RV pigtail, electrical cable ramps, etc." Does that mean that we are to be the electrician or that there will be a separate electrician contracted to connect all of these items? The NPS will have an electrician on site for the duration of the project
-What are the size requirements for the light towers? portable  on wheels, crank up stand tower with  basic 4 or 6 lights-Will the dumpster be placed on the grass where flooring will be required for delivery and pickup?    The dumpster will be placed on a temporary gravel road provided by the NPS  	-How long will the generators run per day? of the 4 200KW generators, the one that remains for the month is back up and hopefully will not run at all.  a second 200KW is a back up for the Dec 9th event only and hopefully it will not run.  The remaining 2 g 200KW generators will run the evening of Dec 8th, and will need to be refuelled once prior to the Dec 9th event.- How long will the light towers run? Light towers will run for approximately 1 hour after the event 2-3 units may run 3-4 hours    -Will we provide fueling or will the NPS handle that? Vendor will be responsible for the one refueling on Dec 8th or 9th ( If we are required to provide fuel, will that be a separate amount?All generators should arrive fully fueled,  the additional refueling should be included in the bid.- If fueling's are required are we and ALL vendors required to provide spill containment? Yes, all vendors are responsible for spill containment -On the tent structures to be erected is tent flooring required? Or is the interlocking protective material  like Armor Decking in lieu of flooring? Or no required at all for tents? The NPS will furnish all Tent flooring-For some of the odd shape tents like the 20x100 can multiple tents be used to meet the requirements? For example 2: 20x40 and 1: 20x20. Yes, this is not a problem-In the RFQ it list a number of 21 propane heaters with 8 refill tanks is that 8 per heater or 8 spare? the 8 refill tanks  are for the tent that will remain for the month -Are the 21 Propane heaters listed in item 8 of the RFQ for the tents and the requirement in item 4 for the heat package a description or are additional heaters needed for the tents in item 4 above and beyond the heaters in item 8? The 21 heaters and the heat packages are the same-Are there any power outlet requirements for the tent other than the lighting system? no-Does the contractor need to plan for snow removal on the sites for setup? NO, the NPS will provide snow removal  this if necessary-Is there a site setup diagram available for planning purposes for the movement of equipment and vehicle decking for the grass area?  Will be provided to awardee
-Zippered tent doors: We could provide more secure doors if they were closed by Velcro or rope lace. Would this be acceptable? Yes, velcro is acceptable-Are there any special requirements for what type of lighting should be used in the tents? No special requirements, basic tent activity lighting, lighting should be in the roof and not on the floor-Are spill containment trays required for the generators? If the generator does not have an internal containment system, yes-We normally use EventDeck Ultradeck flooring for turf protection. Is this acceptable?  The only matting needed is for the Executive Wash room, approximately 40-50 feet off the roadway, Event Deck is not approved for use in President's Park.  -Is there a diagram of the layout available so that we can plan how much flooring will be necessary for our forklifts and how many cables will be required for power distribution?  See attached diagram, The NPS will pull all cables to tents for power distribution.  Fork lift is not necessary, and flooring is not necessary, the NPS will provide a roadway to access all locations-Are we able to set up the flooring ahead of time so that tent installation can flow more smoothly? The NPS will provide all tent flooring.-Could setup of the tents begin on Saturday December 4? Yes, but it will have to be coordinated with all other activities. Tent set up can be any time between Nov 27th and Dec 5th.  The external parameter tents need to go in as close to Dec 8th/9th as possible.-When should the 4 toilet pumpings occur?  We will schedule as needed. (95%) of the units are only used  one night and will only require pumping when they leave. -For the bleachers, do you want to seat 200 people total or 200 people on each seat of bleachers? 200 people total-Would a ramp up the stage be acceptable in place of the wheelchair lift? Due to snow and ice, a ramp is not acceptable.-How many hours will the generators run? all of the small generators will run 4 hours, of the 4 200KW, 2 hopefully will not run at all, the remaining 2 will run approximately 20 hours each -How many hours will the heaters run? heaters will run the day of the show, Dec 9th from 6  am- 9 pm, with the exception of 1 tent that will be used the 5 days prior and the tent that remains onsite for the duration, it will run daily-How many hours will the light towers run? approximately 4 hours-Also do the tents have any flooring or just carpet?, The NPS will provide flooring for all tents,

<DESC>Reference is made to the Sep 29, 2010 announcement, reference number 2010- 81026A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Romania - Electronic Election Management System Feasibility Study.<br /><br />The following clarification has been provided by the Grantee and/or USTDA in response to questions received:<br /><br />1) "The next tender will be done under the provisions of the Romanian legislation for public acquisitions and also depend on the funds that we use, [as different sources of funding have] specific rules. In this case, it is not illegal for a person who worked on the feasibility study to work also for the company that implements the following project, but, from my point of view, it is inappropriate. If the same company will do the feasibility study and also will participate in the following tender, there could be a conflict of interest if the specifications from the feasibility study are used to generate technical specifications for the following tender."

<DESC><strong>Title: Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS)<br /></strong><br />NOTE, THIS IS A REVISED POSTING TO THE PREVIOUS&nbsp;BIDDER'S LIBRARY ANNOUNCEMENT.&nbsp; REVISIONS TO CERTAIN ATTACHMENTS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO POTENTIAL OFFERORS HAVE THE MOST RELEVANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE.&nbsp; <br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO RELEASE OF THE BIDDER'S LIBRARY IN SUPPORT OF THE POTENTIAL JPATS T-6 COMBS REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Air Force Materiel Command, JPATS Program Office is releasing its bidder's library. All data currently eligible for public release is attached to this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to allow industry the opportunity to review the Government's available data in order to facilitate comments, questions, and concerns regarding the adequacy of the information. The Government will publically disclose, via FedBizOps (FBO), any and all questions, comments, or concerns received (submitter information will be withheld). Additionally, the Government will provide responses to any questions, comments, or concerns received with subsequent FBO posting(s). Any changes made to the bidder's library as a result of comments, questions, or concerns received will be announced via FBO as well. <br /><br />In addition to the data posted to FBO, industry is advised that additional, non-publically releaseable data will be made available in the bidder's library. Industry is further advised that in order to see the available limited distribution data, each company must certify itself as a US DoD Contractor or potential US DoD Contractor in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 5230.25, specifically concerning the dissemination of Distribution Statement "D" and "F" data. If a company is unable to assert this, it will not be granted access to the limited distribution data. As a minimum (note, this does not alleviate the full requirements of DODD 5230.25), potential offerors must advise the Government of the following information for base access and data access consideration:<br /><br />1. Company Name<br />2. CAGE Code<br />3. Name and Citizenship of Person(s) who are requesting&nbsp;access to the data<br />4. Last 4 of SSN<br />5. POC and phone number <br /><br />A list of data with limited distribution is reflected in the attached Bidder's Directory.

Data viewing appointments will be made available upon release of the FORMAL RFP. Times available are 0800 - 1200 and 1230 - 1630, Monday - Friday.</strong> <br /><br />Finally, as noted in the attached Bidder's Directory, the Government is working to provide access to additional documents that may be necessary for bidder's to adequately propose. As releaseability determinations are made on these documents, the Government will inform potential offerors of how to gain access to each document. This will be through formal FBO postings. Note, the Government intends to finalize all Bidder's Library data by release of the FORMAL RFP.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. <br />JPATS is an Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) program. <br />The current status is: Pre-Solicitation.<br />Solicitation Number: FA8617-11-R-6208<br />Response Date: N/A

<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ISSUED BY THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (NRL) FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. HOWEVER, RESPONSES MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR A FUTURE ACQUISITION.</p>
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Space Science Division (Code 7600), is requesting information and ROM estimate of cost for providing Engineering Models (EM) and spaceflight qualified calibration light sources for the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) that are part of an instrument suite proposed for a NASA EXPLORER spaceflight mission. The MDI instrument will consist of two similar units that will each measure upper atmospheric winds along their line of sight. A set of three different calibration lamps is required for each of the two MDI units. The three different lamp types are (1) an emission line source providing signal at the 630.48 nm neon line, (2) an emission line source providing signal at the 557.03 nm krypton line, and (3) a single broadband source providing a continuum emission that spans at least several nm around the 630 nm and 557 nm lines. Other lamp types emitting atomic lines with wavelengths that are within less than about 1 nm of 630 nm and 557.7 nm could also be considered. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Examples of suitable lamps are likely to include spectral lamps with external electrodes using high frequency excitation and tungsten ribbon lamps. The lamp units are to include the power supply and switch, excitation mechanism, mechanical structure, and emitting volume. The specifications referenced herein are export controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As such, in order to receive the referenced specifications, potential Customers must complete the attached certification with proof of status as a U.S. Person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15) and submit via email to Ms. Lisa Fleming, at <a href="mailto:lisa.fleming@nrl.navy.mil">lisa.fleming@nrl.navy.mil</a>. Upon confirmation of eligibility, potential offerers will be sent draft copies of the Statement of Work and specifications. The Statement of Work and specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations. Technical questions shall be directed to Christoph Englert, NRL Code 7641 via email <a href="mailto:christoph.englert@nrl.navy.mil">christoph.englert@nrl.navy.mil</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gauge industry interest, capabilities, and relevant heritage experience and know-how for providing the MDI calibration sources. It is the goal of NRL to maximize heritage experience and know-how and to minimize risk and cost to the MDI program. As such NRL will be using the responses and ROM cost estimates for determination of whether to procure the requirement via a formal contract or to build part or all of the hardware in-house. If NRL decides to procure this hardware, an EM lamp set would need to be delivered in mid-2013, with two sets of flight lamps and one flight spare lamp set to be delivered in mid-2014. Examples of key evaluation criteria that might be used include: 1) Relevant corporate and key personnel heritage experience and know-how, 2) Hardware performance from past programs including lamp lifetime, mass, size, power consumption, 3) Cost/cost realism, and 4) Schedule. If a solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that it will call for a three phase hybrid contract: with Phase 1 awarded on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis that will continue through completion of Phase A (lamp specification refinement); Phase 2 awarded on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis that will cover from the start of Phase B through CDR (EM lamp set development and delivery); and, Phase 3 awarded on a fixed price basis that will span from CDR through delivery of the flight and flight spare lamps.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit the information requested herein, as well as, a ROM/cost estimate.</p>
<p>This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of NRL to acquire any products or services. The NRL does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. Submission of a response to this RFI is voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the NRL to pay or entitle the submitter to any compensation. All information and data received in response to this RFI that are marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be protected as such. Responses to this RFI may be submitted in writing or by email no later than 4PM EDT <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">October 28, 2010</strong>.</p>
<p>Information may be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): CH2M Hill, Inc., Contract # W912EF-07-D-0003<br><br>Under W912EF-07-D-0003, Task Order 0005, the CH2M Hill, Inc. conducted and prepared a predesign study and feasibility study.  Based on the outcomes of that task order, the PDT determined that a two-phased approach would be used to accomplish the project goal.  The ultimate design includes full flow drum screens.  However, compliance may be obtained sooner and with less initial costs and less operating costs by phasing in the construction.  The first phase would include those items identified in the feasibility design that at a minimum are necessary to bring the facility into compliance.  <BR><BR>The purpose of this task order is for the AE to complete a Value Engineering (VE) Study on the feasibility study (30% design) completed under Task Order 0005.<BR><BR>Background<BR><BR>The Dworshak Fish Hatchery located near Orofino, Idaho is owned by the Walla Walla District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Nez Perce Tribe.  The hatchery raises approximately 2.0 million steelhead smolts annually to release in the Clearwater River as part of the COE Dworshak Dam mitigation program.  The hatchery also participates in the Lower Snake River Compensation Plan, raising approximately 1.0 million Chinook salmon smolts for the North Fork River each year.  Additionally, 280,000 Coho salmon smolts are raised as part of a cooperative program with the Nez Perce Tribe and 15,000 rainbow trout are raised for outreach activities.<BR><BR>The Dworshak Fish Hatchery has a total of 84 concrete Burrows Ponds arranged into three different systems.  Each system has the infrastructure and equipment for operation under water reuse configuration.  The Burrows Ponds in System I were constructed for reuse during the initial hatchery construction and reuse equipment was added in System II and III during the second phase of construction.  In system I and II, Burrows pond effluent is collected in one of two concrete effluent drain channels that run perpendicular to the ponds, one channel drains directly to the river and the other transfers pond effluent to the corresponding systems reuse treatment equipment.  System III effluent can be directed to either the systems channel pump sump for reuse operation or to the River for discharge. Dworshak Fish Hatchery cannot utilize the reuse system because of water quality issues.  When the reuse system is utilized, water quality decreases and fish mortality increases.<BR><BR>Dworshak Fish Hatchery has 30 raceways arranged in 2 banks.  The majority of effluent exits the hatchery via the fish ladder.  Cleaning effluent can be diverted to a sump and then pumped to the settling basin and out to the North Fork Clearwater River.  The hatchery has 128 small nursery tanks in the nursery room.  Nursery tank effluent is always treated in one of two full-flow clarifying basins that are part of the System I Burrows Pond reuse system.<BR><BR>Dworshak Fish Hatchery currently discharges the majority of hatchery effluent directly to either the North Fork of the Clearwater River or the Clearwater River with minimal or no effluent treatment.  There are a total of 29 discharge locations from the hatchery although many of them are storm drains or overflows that do not come into contact with fish rearing environments or do not discharge on a continuous basis.  Nursery tank effluent is always treated in one of two full-flow clarifying basins.  When not operated in reuse, effluent from ponds in Systems I and II is discharged directly to the Clearwater or North Fork Rivers.  System I Burrows pond effluent is only treated in the systems clarifying basins during water reuse operation.  Fish typically experience poor health during the time the reuse systems are being operated, particularly fish in Systems II and III.  System III is no longer operated in reuse configuration due to the extensive decline in fish health during reuse operation.<BR><BR>Discharge permits in the state of Idaho are issued through the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Dworshak Fish Hatchery currently operates under discharge Permit #IDG131003 within the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), General Permit #IDG131000 for Cold Water Aquaculture Facilities in Idaho without waste load allocations.  In December 2008, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq to the FWS for violating their General Aquaculture NPDES permit.  The two primary violations were the discharge of untreated cleaning wastewater and that the Dworshak Fish Hatchery lacked the means to measure flow.<BR><BR>If an aquaculture wastewater treatment facility in Idaho needs to be changed or modified, the director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) must approve the plan prior to construction or modification.  The DEQ must also be notified when the project is complete so that a representative from the DEQ can conduct onsite inspection of the completed project to ensure compliance with the approved plans and specifications.<BR>

<AWARDEE>ATHENA DIAGNOSTICS, INC.;377 PLANTATION ST STE 2;WORCESTER;MA;016052300
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

	
1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.
	VA BOSTON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Procurement for: Diagnostic Testing for Neurological Disorders
	
*2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved
     SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR: Athena Diagnostics 523-10-2-2765-0055 

*3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).

Estimated Dollar value: $175,000 per year, $15,000 per month at most of the facility listed in statement work.  Service will be for base and four option years.
Item Description: Various Diagnostic Tests for Neurological Disorders 

4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

	FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source,

*5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority sited.

Athena Diagnostic is the only source providing test for Neurologic disorders as stated in the statement of work for patient care. It has been shown that other companies would have to route testing to Athena Diagnostic for processing.   A reviewed was done on Quest Diagnostics Test Menu and ARUP Laboratories on their Federal Supply Schedule and test were not shown on schedule.  Quest does not offer these test within the Quest Network. Tests sent through Quest are routed to Athena however; experience in VISN 1 has shown that many specimens were rejected by Athena because Quest was unable to deliver to Athena timely.  Due to specimen stability testing must be sent directly to Athena.

*6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are 	solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a  Federal Business Opportunities: FBO Notice was or will be published.

  A notice will be posted on FBO.  . 
	
7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

Determination was conducted and the anticipated cost to the government is fair and reasonable based on historic data from 2007 to 2009. There has only been about a 9.1% percent increase for all Neurological Disorder testing during this time frame.  


8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not    conducted.

A market survey was conducted and found that all test needed for patient care for the Diagnostic Testing for Neurological Disorders are routed to Athena since they are the one source capable of producing the responses of these test in a timely manner. 

*9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data  packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not 	available.
     None

10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

ARUP Laboratories

11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

Contracting Activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible

<ARCHDATE>11162010
<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
<p>SUBJECT: Sole Source Procurement (Radio Upgrade for the 911 Call Center)</p>
<p>FINDINGS</p>
<p>1. In accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Supplies and services required are available from only one or a limited number of sources, the CO may solicit for a "sole source" only procurement. Also, IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&amp;A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13. Dollar amount on requirement is expected to be below the SAT.</p>
<p>2. IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. Written justification from the customer was received stating the characteristics of the desired radio upgrade, enhancing Civil Engineering capabilities in supporting the mission.</p>
<p>3. The Malmstrom AFB 911 Fire Dispatch Center currently uses fire alarm systems by Monaco. Only Monaco Transceivers communicate with Monaco D-21 Fire Management System Receivers. The company has proprietary rights to its systems (receivers and transceivers) and other brand name systems are not interchangeable with it. It is not economically feasible to replace the fully operational Monaco D-21 Fire Management System and existing narrowband transceivers. If another brand name was used it would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>4. Fire alarms are mission critical processes and failure to receive alarms could result in damage to base property, national security, and/or loss of life. The Monaco D-21 system provides a platform for the integration of a multitude of life safety systems (E-911 call locating, voice recording, paging control, phone recall, mass notification), provides tools for fire system management, and consolidates activities to reduce complexity of task.</p>
<p>5. The purchase of the D-21 upgrade system will provide Malmstrom AFB with a completely integrated alarm receiving system that is designed to work with its current systems, which were manufactured and installed by Monaco. If Malmstrom were to purchase a different platform other than Monaco, then a substantial amount of other equipment/systems already in use would have to be replaced, resulting in a duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DETERMINATION</p>
<p>Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a sole source procurement for this requirement from Monaco Enterprises, Inc. is in the best interest of the Government and a sound business decision.</p>

Subj:  VHA Business Performance Improvement Committee (BPIC) Program Management Office (PMO) Support Bridge Task Order Modification 0001

To:  File


JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION	

In accordance with FAR 6.303,  justification and approval for other than full and open competition is hereby approved for the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:

Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 5     
849 International Drive, Suite 275
Linthicum, MD 21090

2.  NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:   This justification and approval is for the award of a sole source six month "bridge" task order to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) for Veterans Health Administration (VHA)'s Business Performance Management Improvement Committee (BPIC) Program Management Office (PMO) Support.  Estimated cost is $342,719.34

3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:  

The BPIC was formed in 2006 to address Material Weaknesses and other deficiencies noted in external financial audits.  Since this time the committee's function has expanded to include analysis and follow-up regarding financial and business process vulnerabilities identified via internal and external resources.  With the contractor's assistance BPIC intends to deploy massive educational opportunities for Veterans Affairs (VA) staff to support stronger business and financial outcomes; develop tools for monitoring and analyzing current performance with the development of strategies for improvement, and develop and implement processes for strengthening VHA's financial system, which would result in 1) stronger controls, 2) standardized processes and 3) better financial management oversight.  
VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) has repeatedly noted deficiencies in these 3 areas; therefore, VHA has a responsibility to take the actions necessary to resolve these audit findings.  


Examples of current BPIC projects include:

"	Piloting a Computer Assisted Audit Tool, that will aid in the identification of error, fraud and/or waste.
"	State Veteran Home Payment Process review, which involves an analysis of current application of laws, procedures, processes and habits that have resulted in placing significant resources at risk.
"	Development of an Environmental Scan Matrix, which pulls together audit findings; applicable references and training materials; existing reports and monitors, and information regarding process owners onto a consolidated platform.
"	Hosting the first ever national training conference for Fiscal, Engineering, Logistics and Contracting employees to cover their shared areas of responsibilities (pending VA Secretary's approval).

BPIC's routine activities encompass the following key areas and tasks: 

"	Reporting and Communications 

o	Undertake routine internal communications with VHA BPIC SF staff, and the BPIC Chair and Co-Chair to ensure effective coordination of activities
o	Provide routine progress reporting to the NLB and NLB Executive Committee (monthly)
o	Provide progress reporting to the Under Secretary of Health (USH), Deputy Under Secretary of Healthcare Operations and Management (DUSHOM), Chief of Staff, and VA Deputy Secretary (as needed)
o	Develop an annual report on the key activities and successes of BPIC for dissemination to VHA executive leadership and VA stakeholders
o	Develop and maintain an ongoing communications plan for BPIC membership groups, VA/VHA executive leadership, and other stakeholders. Assess the effectiveness of BPIC communication strategies.
o	Edit and update content for the BPIC Web site.  The BPIC website is established on the VHA intranet.  The contractor is expected to coordinate these activities with VHA website support staff.
o	Document progress in the form of minutes
o	Draft and publish quarterly BPIC Newsletters






"	Logistical Support

o	Development and maintenance of a calendar for all BPIC meetings (and communication to BPIC membership), including the BPIC Steering Committee, Business Education Subcommittee, the Advisory Group, and any ad hoc task forces or working groups (Note: for planning purposes, in FY 2009 the BPIC SF assisted the activities of around six ad hoc groups, most of which were chartered for periods of three to six months)
o	Secure meeting rooms, teleconference lines, video-conferencing services for regular and ad hoc meetings (via VHA's existing internal support services)
o	Provide general administrative support for operational activities
o	Support all BPIC meetings including development of agendas, supplemental materials, formulating minutes for key meetings, and updating the BPIC website with meeting materials
o	Coordinate preparatory meetings for the Chair and Co-Chair in advance of the monthly Steering Committee meetings
"	Process Support 
o	Formulation and maintenance of policies, Standarized Operating Procedures (SOP), templates, charters, handbooks, and tools to support BPIC SF's operations
o	Provision of procedural guidance to BPIC groups' Chairs and members, and as necessary to VHA offices submitting initiatives to the BPIC for review
o	Sharing information with other VA/VHA offices in BPIC processes and tools on an as needed basis
"	Tracking and Monitoring of BPIC's Project/Initiative Portfolio 
o	Undertake tracking and oversight of BPIC's portfolio of projects/initiatives undertaken by all the BPIC groups, including monitoring of schedule, costs, deliverables, and milestones
o	Undertake routine monitoring of progress and communications with BPIC groups to ensure timely deliverables and accountability 
o	Tracking and monitoring reports will be included as part of routine reporting to VA/VHA leadership and other stakeholders
"	Performance and Risk Management
o	Development and maintenance of performance and risk management plans
o	Assist with oversight of performance management metrics and systems to monitor business quality improvement and resolution of material weaknesses
o	Compare performance from each fiscal year in key areas of vulnerability identified as priorities
o	Support effective risk identification, management and mitigation activities relevant to BPIC's activities
o	Report of relevant performance and risk management data to the BPIC Chair, Co-Chair, and Steering Committee, in addition to inclusion in reports to VA/VHA executive leadership
"	Training Support and Delivery
o	Assist with the development and delivery of training curricula, materials, and associated materials for BPIC groups
o	Provide ad hoc training to VHA leadership on BPIC activities and operations

BAH will provide BPIC Program Management Office Support.  This includes assisting with the development of associated management tools, charters, templates, and other heuristics to effectively support BPIC's activities.

BAH will develop/maintain a Project Work Plan, and provide monthly status reports.  Monthly status reports are due by the tenth of each month and will detail progress made during the prior period, progress expected during the next period, resources expended, any significant problems or issues encountered, recommended actions to resolve identified problems, and any variances from the proposed schedule and cost.

4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY: FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and compelling urgency, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2).

5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  

Since its inception, BAH has provided the necessary resources to facilitate discussions, develop analytical tools, track progress and publish status reports, assist with the development of strategies, provide structure for educational events/meetings and provide administrative support functions.  

This "bridge" task order against BAH's GSA schedule will allow work to continue while the requirement is recompeted in FY11.

6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  No efforts were made to solicit potential sources for this procurement.

7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  Pricing for this task order is considered to be fair and reasonable as GSA has already conducted price analysis in the award of BAH's GSA Schedule GS-23F-9755H.

8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  Market research was not conducted for this contract action, given the urgent and compelling nature of this requirement.

9.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT:  BAH has developed a thorough understanding of the issues being addressed by BPIC and has played a major role in the development of strategies for improvement. Allowing the current contractor to continue to work under this task order will allow time for the services to be re-competed and will facilitate smooth transition to the next contract.

10.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A

11.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN:  This requirement will be competed for a FY11 award, if the VHA BPIC PMO decides to continue this requirement for the long term.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:  I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs
Office of Acquisition and Logistics
      Technology Acquisition Center
      260 Industrial Way West
      Eatontown, NJ 07724
         
2.	Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for a 12-month base period, with three (3) 12-month options, for software engineering services to support the Flight, On-the-Job Training, Correspondence, and Apprenticeship System (FOCAS).

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  FOCAS is an application that supports out of system benefits.  Each of the four (4) Education Regional offices owned and operated a copy of the Visual Dbase single-user, stand-alone FOCAS application.  The FOCAS application is being rehosted from a visual database single-user, stand-alone system to a multi-user, web-based Java Release 2 Enterprise Environment (J2EE) enterprise architecture application that performs the same functions as the legacy system.  This is a time sensitive development effort in conjunction with the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill Program, one of Secretary Eric K. Shinseki's top 13 initiatives.  The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides financial support for education and housing to individuals with at least 90 days of aggregate service on or after September 11, 2001, or individuals discharged with a service-connected disability after 30 days.  The specific software engineering services needed to support the FOCAS are as follows: 
"	Complete data testing and migration of the FOCAS data existing in the current four (4) FOCAS applications. 
"	Release FOCAS into production.  
"	Implement key functional enhancements to the application to allow processing of claims for veterans and their beneficiaries related to the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill program.
"	Enhance and modernize the application as required from missing functionality identified in User Acceptance Testing.
"	Optional maintenance period, optional knowledge transfer, and optional end user training.  

The total estimated price of the proposed action is 

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), Veterans First Contracting Program.  Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written justification as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, "Authorized or required by statute".

5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed source for this action is Veterans Enterprise Technology Solutions, Inc. (VETS Inc.), 2057 Woodford Road, Suite 20 Vienna, VA 22182, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  FOCAS is being enhanced to pay benefits to veterans and beneficiaries under the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill program.  VETS Inc. developed a similar system called, Work-Study Management System (WSMS), and assisted in the original development period of the FOCAS project, writing some of the source code which they shared with the FOCAS application developers.  VETS Inc. already has the needed technical knowledge required to meet the Government's requirements.  The FOCAS application is built using the same platform and similar coding to the WSMS.  This eliminates the learning curve required for other developers to become current on the development effort.  Additionally, the VETS Inc. team and subcontractors are already on site and working at the Veterans Administration Central Office (VACO) and will not be required to undergo the lengthy process of security clearances and on-boarding.  FOCAS development will also have to be compatible with the existing VA Corporate Database and Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) development processes, as the original development for FOCAS was done.  VETS Inc. is already familiar with the VA Corporate Database development procedures and OIT processes as they built the WSMS system within the same confines, and built part of the code for the VA Corporate Database that was used by the original FOCAS contractors.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted and the details are contained in the market research section below.  Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  All future requirements for the procurement of software engineering services for the FOCAS will be handled on a case-by-case basis. 

8.	Market Research:  Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on February 26, 2010 to determine if VETS Inc. was a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that VETS Inc. is registered and certified in the VetBiz.gov database and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with the federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System code 541512.  Additionally, a search in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) performed on June 15, 2010 showed that VETS Inc. is registered in CCR.  Based on this market research and assessment of their capabilities, the Government's technical experts have determined that VETS Inc. is a SDVOSB and can meet the Government's requirements.

9.	Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of 38 U.S.C 8127(c);  this procurement is below the $5,000,000 threshold, VETS, Inc. is a responsible SDVOSB, and the Contracting Officer will be  able to obtain a fair and reasonable price offering a best value to the Government.

 


10.	Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
