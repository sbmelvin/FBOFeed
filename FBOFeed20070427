<DESC>The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) owns over 700 bridges on national wildlife refuges, fish hatcheries, and other facilities associated with fish and wildlife conservation.  Many of these bridges serve essential administrative functions or provide visitor access. The Service bridge safety program was initiated in 1992 to ensure the safety and integrity of the Service's bridges through an inventory and inspection program.  Inspections are conducted in accordance with National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) and Service Bridge Safety Program guidelines.  Safety deficiencies are identified and safe load limits calculated.  Maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction needs are identified and preliminary level cost estimates are developed for use by Service managers in setting priorities and to assist in preparing budget proposals.  Data required for submittal to the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) is produced. The objective of this contract is to provide expert technical support for the Service bridge safety program, primarily through bridge inspections and reports. The inspections to be performed under this contract will require nationwide travel and other services may require travel to regional offices located nationwide. The Contractor shall be required to furnish Title I, II, or III Services to the Fish and Wildlife Service for facilities in various locations nationwide.  Typical services include inspection and evaluation of bridges with regard to condition, safety, and serviceability, including review of any existing information including previous inspection reports, determining maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and new construction needs, calculating new or verifying previous load ratings, preparing cost estimates for needed work, preparing reports, and  drafting sketches of the bridges.  The Contractor must utilize the Service's web-based bridge database which currently resides within the Service's Engineering Facilities Management Information System (EFMIS) to perform data-entry of bridge safety inspection findings.  This will include, but is not limited to, entry of National Bridge Inventory data reporting requirements, entry of bridge inspection findings, and uploading of digital bridge images. Informal presentation of inspection results to regional Service personnel will also be required. Most of the inspections will involve re-inspection of previously inspected bridges; some may be initial inspection of newly constructed or newly acquired bridges that have not been inspected by Service forces.  The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders. The maximum ordering limitation for each contract period will be $800,000.00. The guaranteed minimum for each contract period is $20,000.00. Solicitation number 982107R011 SF330, will be posted on or about May 17, 2007.  For information concerning this order contact Alina Sadoveanu at Alina_Sadoveanu@fws.gov.

<DESC>The overall mission and goal of the Naval Warrior Applications Division program titled Force Health Protection Future Capability (FHPFC) is to identify those mature and evolving technologies that, through focused investment, guidance and management, can be demonstrated and subsequently made available to the warfighter through a systematic transition to the acquisition process.  The products of the FHPFC investment are to be capabilities that are demonstrated to, and by, the primary customer (fleet operational forces), and, equally as important, capabilities that are ready for transition to the acquisition community.  The FHPFC will not attempt to develop all of the required technologies but will focus on those key areas where the most capability payoff is expected and/or where transition potential is highest.  Many other needed technologies are being pursued by other DoD projects, and the FHPFC will need to leverage and use those technology developments wherever possible.  

The following is a list of the major focus areas of interest to the FHPFC.  ONR is soliciting individual or team efforts to develop innovative technologies in those areas.  It cannot be emphasized too strongly that developments in these areas must work towards an operational demonstration during which the FHPFC products will interact seamlessly with naval systems and information.  

Combat Casualty Care and Management
1.)Capability to non-surgically manage intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal, intra-cranial hemorrhage
2.) Capability to diagnose and treat mild/moderate brain injury (TBI) resulting from repetitive exposure to blast and identification of mechanisms of injury
3.) Capability to more effectively manage wounds to limit infection, accelerate healing and/or tissue regeneration
4.) Capability for scaleable, deployable, medical isolation aboard Navy platforms and improved provision of care onboard high speed vessels
5.) Capability for automated patient monitoring and treatment
6.) Capability to rapidly type, cross-match and detect pathogens in fresh whole blood being collected for transfusion in austere environments (please contact the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) below for full system requirements)

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research.  The NIH Clinical Center serves as the nation?s premier research hospital for conducting clinical research to improve the health of human kind. It also serves as a national resource for clinical research by developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, enhancing systems to ensure the safe, efficient, and ethical conduct of clinical research, training clinical researchers, and leading the response to the nation?s public health needs.

A 234-bed research hospital located at the heart of the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, the Clinical Center supports nearly 50% of all NIH funded general clinical research center beds in the nation, as well as over 25% of outpatient visits.  In supporting approximately 1,200 active clinical research protocols, the Clinical Center admits patients from around the country and the world who participate in experimental treatments and studies at no charge. Protocol participants include both patients receiving treatment and other research volunteers.  Both are eligible for travel reimbursement according to the protocol guidelines. The term patient will be used to refer to all types of protocol participants and their authorized guardians throughout this document.

Patients can be self-referred to the Clinical Center or referred for enrollment into a protocol by the patient?s primary care physician or from tertiary care facilities.  No one simply arrives at the doors of the Clinical Center and is admitted.  Because Clinical Center patients volunteer as subjects, they are not charged for the care they receive. The majority of visits (e.g. inpatient admissions or outpatient visits) are planned, however, occasions arise necessitating immediate return of the patient (e.g., if a donor match is identified or a patient becomes ill) in which case emergent travel arrangements are required.

Patients travel from all fifty United States and some from abroad to participate in clinical research studies at the Clinical Center.  This contract will provide travel management services to these patients.  These services are subject to a new NIH Policy on Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses for NIH Intramural Clinical Research Protocol Participants.  

The implementation of the new NIH Patient Travel Policy requires new processes. As a result, this contract will be divided into Phase I and Phase II.  

Phase I will include three tasks.  Task A: The Contractor will staff an on-site Patient Travel Office (PTO) that provides airline and train travel services for patients. Task B:  The contractor will actively participate in the development and implementation of the procedures and the quality assurance plan to provide the government arranged travel and lodging and reimbursement for approved travel expenses.  Task C:  The contractor will be responsible for establishing a database containing patient travel cost information and formulating routine and ad hoc reports.  

Phase II will include three tasks.  Task A:  The Contractor will to continue to staff an on-site PTO that provides airline and train reservations for patients and add lodging reservations. Task B: The contractor will provide reimbursement for approved travel expenses (lodging, meals and transportation).  This may require the contractor to make significant cash outlays on a monthly basis-possibly exceeding $190,000 per month.  Task C: The contractor will be responsible for maintaining the database containing patient travel cost information and providing monthly and ad hoc reports.  

The Clinical Center anticipates a one-year contract with four (4) one-year options. This is not a Request for Proposals.     The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about June 1, 2007 from www.fedbizopps.gov.     No hard copies will be distributed.     All questions must be submitted in writing to Ann Argaman (aargaman@cc.nih.gov)  or Janice Brunson ( jbrunson@cc.nih.gov).

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 5/15/2007.  Proposals shall be received in the Office of Business and Support Services (6ADB), Federal Building, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 1161, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088 on 6/19/2007.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in descending order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan and Technical Approach.  The technical factor is significantly more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  

The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status. 

Small Business Participation: In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns.  Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract.  Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small (37%), small disadvantaged (6%), small women-owned (5%), small HUBZone (3%), small veteran-owned (5%) and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small (3%) business concerns.  Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the above minimum goals for all subcontracted work.  

Offers from HUBZone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13. FAR Clause 52.219-4 - Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns shall apply.

<DESC>Description:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), located at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to award a sole-source contract to AT&T Corp. for MObile Ground Entry Point Service (MOGEPS).  MOGEPS is a specialized telecommunications service needed to continue similar service previously delivered by AT&T Corp. under contract DCA200-95-C-0080.  The purpose of MOGEPS is to provide air-to-ground communications capability to certain suitably equipped aircraft performing special missions anywhere in the world.  Examples of aircraft supported are E-4B National Airborne Operations Center aircraft, E-6B Airborne National Command Post Aircraft, Air Force One, and other Air Force and Navy aircraft operating in support of the National Command Authority and National Military Command System.  MOGEPS will extend the reach of the U.S. Air Force Northstar Network to these aircraft as they occasionally operate in areas not served by Northstar.  To provide this service the contractor shall maintain two teams of personnel and portable equipment ready at all times to travel to required service locations on a minimum of twenty four hours notice.  The contractor shall provide full duplex, 15 channel, voice and data communications service over a T-1 circuit path.  The MOGEPS equipment shall link with an airborne aircraft via Ultra High Frequency radio utilizing military frequencies, or via physical connection when an aircraft is on the ground.  Within the Continental U.S., MOGEPS shall normally link to Northstar via use of a terrestrial circuit, which will be provided by the Government.  Outside the Continental U.S., the link to Northstar will normally be via a contractor arranged Ku, C, or X band satellite link back to the U.S.  MOGEPS equipment must be compatible with the legacy terminal equipment aboard the aircraft served, as the Government is not in a position to replace existing aircraft terminals to be compatible with new design MOGEPS equipment using different technology.  The aircraft terminals currently in use are based upon customized military equipment no longer manufactured, combined  in unique equipment configurations, using custom telecommunications software, and producing signals with unique technical  parameters.  There are no acceptable commercial substitutes for the equipment and software in use.  Performance of this contract requires access to classified telecommunications information.  MOGEPS team members must as a minimum have a secret security clearance.  No subcontracting opportunities are expected for this contract.  All inquiries regarding the procurement solicitation should be submitted electronically to Mr. Stan Schellenbach, Contract Specialist, e-mail stan.schellenbach@disa.mil, or Ms Lisa A. Boeckmann, Contracting Officer, e-mail lisa.boeckmann@disa.mil, no later than 14 May 2007.  NAICS Code 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.

STATEMENT OF WORK ? GENERAL:  Since its inception the Border Patrol has utilized horses in support of the mission to which it is assigned.  Certain minimum requirements have been established and the successful contractor/seller is expected to comply with the established parameters when supplying horses for service mounts. 

REQUIREMENTS: Breeds- Quarter Horses are the desired breed. Crossbreeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the government. Age- the horse shall have a documented age between five (5) and ten (10) years of age. (Exceptions to purchasing an older horse will be made on a case-by-case basis.).

Sex- All service mounts will be altered male horses (Geldings). 

SELECTION CRITERIA: The following shall be considered in selecting a horse for service: Most riders have little or no experience.

Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters. A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment. Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program. 

SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS: A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation. The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition. Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase. Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area. Halter- The horse should be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or resistance to ?catching?. Leading- The candidate horse should exhibit good ground manners and should remain calm when being handled. Saddling- The candidate horse should stand still and calm while being saddled. He should show no signs of aggressiveness of being ?cinchy? during this process. Mounting- The candidate horse should stand still and calm during this evolution.

Excessive force should not be necessary during this process. Dismounting- The candidate horse should stand quietly while the rider dismounts. Loading/Unloading- The candidate horse should load and unload from a variety of trailers without difficulty. Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a candidate horse. Shoeing- The candidate horse should stand quietly and calmly while being shod or having his feet worked on. 

TEMPERAMENT: All candidate horses should exhibit the ?proper temperament? during the entire selection process. The candidate horse should be calm when any number of people or equipment are moving or standing around him. He must display confidence in any number of environments, including areas of unsure footing, tight enclosed or narrow spaces, moving vehicles/equipment, loud noises and/or bangs and popping sounds. Although the flight or fight response is always prevalent, the candidate horse must remain calm or quickly recover and not run off with the rider when startled. The candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness and around large groups of people. 

DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED: Current vaccination/Quarantine records. Health certificate issued by a certified/licensed veterinarian. Registration certificates, breed surveys and other related paperwork, as applicable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of the candidate horse as a prerequisite to completing the selection process. 

MISCELLANEOUS: The Government retains the right to return a candidate horse to the contractor/seller, if after 45 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for service. This determination will be based on the selection criteria or the horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service. The vendor will replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned conditions exist. This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the selection criteria. The Government retains the sole right to make any and all determinations as to the acceptability/unacceptability of the candidate.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) intends to solicit proposals for a single award Indefinite Quality Contract (IQC).  The contract will be for a period of five (5) years.  The types of task orders awarded under the IQC will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) with Fixed Daily Rates (FDR).  USAID will award the contract under a Total Small Business set aside.  The anticipated estimated cost of the five year period shall not exceed $6,800,000.  

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives, supports U.S. foreign policy objectives by helping local partners advance peace and democracy in priority countries in crisis. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs.  

The purpose of the resulting IQC is to provide services for the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) that fall under the broad categories of monitoring and evaluation; personnel development; and short term technical assistance. OTI's country programs must be flexible, responsive and targeted at the country's specific transition needs. At the same time, the program teams must be able to monitor the implementation of the programs, their results, and to be able to document their impact within the various Agency processes.  There are high demands on program personnel to deploy quickly and demonstrate results immediately. At the same time, the nature of the environment can mean a relatively high turnover for program staff (OTI personnel including Personal Services Contractors (PSCs) and implementing partner staff).  OTI often needs technical experts for short-term assignments based on OTI's need for rapid and flexible programming. The required response time after the task order is awarded may range from 72 hours to one month.

The proposed contract is a 100% set aside for small concerns.  The authorized geographic code for this activity is 000 (U.S.).  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611.  The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued.

Request for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.

The time frame for accepting questions in regard to this notice will be 5 days (04/30/2007 - 05/04/2007).  Questions must be submited in writing by email.  Amanda G.

Other non environmental topics include: how to communicate across cultural lines, to speak publicly, and to work well in a diverse work place. Some of the topics that the students learn are; life skill, job skills, critical thinking, self esteem, peer  pressure, team work and personal and civic responsibility.  The major goal is for the students, after graduation from the program, to take their knowledge back to their own communities to teach others -- especially elementary school kids -- about the environmental issues that affect their lives.

<DESC>2007 EVALUATION OF CONSUMER MEDICATION INFORMATION MATERIALS:  The Food and Drug Administration intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract on a sole-source basis to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  FDA intends to contract with NABP to conduct a national study to assess the distribution and quality of written prescription information provided to persons receiving new prescription medicines in community pharmacies.  NABP served as the prime contractor for the 1998 eight (8)-state pilot study and the 2001 associated study, demonstrating its unique resources for managing this study for FDA. It is critical for the validity of this national study that the same procedures used for the previous study be followed for the proposed new study.  NABPs unique relationships with the State Boards of Pharmacy are critical to this study.     Each State Board of Pharmacy has authority over its States pharmacy practice. NABP assists its member boards in developing, implementing, and enforcing uniform standards for the purpose of protecting the public health.  Since pharmacies throughout the U.S. will participate in this study, NABPs relationship with the State Boards is required in order to manage every aspect of the project.  The methodologies used in the 2001 study shall be applied in the 2007 evaluation to assure comparability of results.  The scope of work requires the Contractor to determine in advance any states in which submitting prescriptions for research is legally prohibited and notify FDA of such legal prohibition.  Pharmacies eligible for the study include those identified as: independent, chain, or franchise pharmacy within any retail, grocery or department store setting.  The Contractor shall notify and obtain cooperation from the State Boards of Pharmacy about the study.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a contract period of 12 months.  This is not a Request for Proposals.    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.   Sources interested in this requirement must provide a detailed capabilities statement to determine if the requirements outlined in this synopsis could be met.         Responses of capabilities must be in writing and must be received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement.

<DESC>The National Supplier Clearinghouse - Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC) is the single organizational entity responsible for issuing or revoking Medicare supplier billing privileges for suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) and maintaining supplier files that contain information collected via the Medicare enrollment application (CMS 855S).  

The NSC-MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS supplier enrollment from that of other Medicare providers and suppliers.  In particular this includes special licensing, insurance, inventory, etc.  The unique standards that DMEPOS suppliers must meet are contained in 42 C.F.R. 424.57.  The primary function of the NSC is to, at a minimum, 1) ensure that only qualified suppliers of Durable Medical equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) are enrolled or remain enrolled in the Medicare program; 2) take necessary actions to revoke enrolled suppliers who no longer meet supplier standards; 3) establish and maintain a fraud prevention and detection program; 4) process DMEPOS supplier enrollment applications and appeals in a timely manner; 5) participate in the development, testing, and transition/implementation/operation of the Provider Enrollment Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) for DMEPOS suppliers; and 6) ensure that all DMEPOS suppliers are properly accredited.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the National Supplier Clearinghouse Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC). It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee plus award fee contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in late May/early June of 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is December 2007.

d.	Accept remittances from lenders on behalf of the SBA with respect to Guaranteed Interests of SBA loans;
e.	Record the date of receipt and the amount received;
f.	Determine if the amounts received for each guaranteed loan match the amount reported on the SBA Form 1502; 
g.	Provide a statement of the outstanding balances of Guaranteed Interests as they appear from the Contractor?s books and records; 
h.	Furnish SBA with timely and current reports on program activity as directed by the COTR and which may be changed from time to time, as the SBA may reasonably require; and
i.	Collect and transfer to the SBA trust account any program fees (basis point ongoing guaranty fees) received and identified by the Contractor up to the second business day prior to the l5th calendar day of the month or the next business day if the l5th day is not a business day ("Payment Date").

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Bradley Penn, 937-904-7149
<DESC>FA8620-07-C-4020 Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) 1C/2C:  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Aeronautical Systems Center , 659  Aeronautical Systems Squadron intends to award a contract on a sole source  basis to Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. for the rapid  development, integration and testing of a fieldable, scaled, communication  intelligence system based on the ASIP architecture for the MQ-1, MQ-1X,  MQ-9 and RQ-4B (Block 30 I) Unmanned Aerial Systems.  The sensor portion  of the system will collect and process selected signals that are  classified up to and including Top Secret/SCI.  Specific requirements are  listed in Section 3 of the ASIP 1C/2C Systems Requirement Document that is  classified Secret/SI (available for review at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio).  The Air Force Distributed Common Ground System will command and control  the ASIP 1C/2C sensors using interface standards established on the  baseline ASIP program. Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. is the sole designer,  developer, and manufacturer of the ASIP family of sensors and is the only  firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and technical data  required to build these sensors in a timely and cost effective manner.  The anticipated design is a scaled version of the existing ASIP sensor and  requires minimal dollars and time to develop.  Planned spiral upgrade and  logistical support funding is insufficient to upgrade/maintain unique  solutions for these platforms and the existing ASIP systems so a single  architecture is required.  Developing a unique solution for these  platforms would result in duplication of efforts. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however,  interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond  to the requirement to the POCs listed.  Information received will be used  to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The  determination to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Numbered note  22 applies. In accordance with recent Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement, the position of the ASC Ombudsman has been  terminated.  If any potential source has questions, comments or concerns  about this particular acquisition please direct all routine non-technical  issues to Mr. Brad Penn, Phone (937) 904-7149, e-mail:  bradley.penn@wpafb.af.mil and for technical issues contact Mr. John Frey,  Phone (937) 255-5999, e-mail: john.frey@wpafb.af.mil For more information on "Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP)  1C/2C SIGINT Sensor Development", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5215

<DESC>Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Export Licensing: 

On 13 January 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and Australian Department of Defence (ADOD) entered into a Project Arrangement (PA) concerning Pre-System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Cooperation in development of the BAMS Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).  Per N00019-07-R-0001, Attachment 2 - BAMS UAS SOO at Section 3.1.10, "The Government will support industry-to-international industry discussions and agreements that could be of benefit to the BAMS UAS program.  The Contractor will explore opportunities for international industrial participation in anticipation of potential Developmental Cooperative Programs and/or Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and prepare for Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs) as necessary."

Navy International Programs Office (NIPO) is available to assist in general export license questions, including matters related to export license application submittals.   NIPO stresses the importance of industry coordinating with their company's export compliance personnel in the preparation of applicable export authorization requests, and ensuring that those requests are scoped appropriately.  The NIPO point of contact is Ms. Jennifer Jemio, jennifer.jemio@navy.mil, telephone 703-601-9869.  It is important to note that any assistance provided by NIPO is to be considered for informational purposes only.

This sole source is to modify the existing contracts by extending the period of performance by five months (June 14, 2007  through November 13, 2007) and by increasing the total contract ceiling price.  These contracts provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).  The extension for the current contracts will prevent a lapse in service during negotitation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services currently posted on www.fbo.gov.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the five month period while completing negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247.  Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address Chicago Office 9800 South Cass Avenue Argonne, IL  60439 Description The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in Princeton, New Jersey. PPPL is a DOE-sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) whose facilities consist of 36 Government-owned buildings, equipment, and other facilities on leased land located on Princeton Universitys James Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey.  The leased premises between the U.S. Government and Princeton University consist of approximately 88 acres.  Additional information regarding PPPL may be found on its website at www.pppl.gov. PPPL is a collaborative national center for plasma and fusion sciences with a core workforce of 397 employees.  The primary mission of the Laboratory is to develop the scientific understanding and key innovations that will lead to a viable fusion energy source.  Associated missions include conducting world-class research along the broad frontier of plasma science and technology, and providing the highest quality of fusion and plasma scientific education for our nations future scientists. PPPL supports DOEs strategic missions in contributing towards the goals of providing energy security and providing world class scientific research capability.  The Laboratory hosts experimental facilities used by multi-institutional research teams and also sends researchers and specialized equipment to other fusion facilities in the U.S. and abroad.  PPPL is the only DOE Laboratory devoted primarily to plasma and fusion sciences and is one of the leading institutions investigating the physics of magnetic fusion energy. Magnetic fusion research at Princeton began in 1951 under the code name Project Matterhorn. For three decades, PPPL has been a leader in magnetic confinement experiments using the tokamak approach.  PPPL has built and operated the largest magnetic fusion experiment in the U.S. (Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor  TFTR) from about 1975  1995.  To deepen the understanding of plasmas and create key innovations to make fusion power a practical reality, PPPL is leading research on advanced fusion devices and developing other innovative confinement concepts.  Currently, the National Spherical Torus Experiment is in operation at PPPL, and the National Compact Stellerator Experiment is under construction and scheduled to begin operation in 2009. The PPPL collaborates with the International community on these concepts. PPPL also maintains its tokamak expertise, gained through long-term research on TFTR and other tokamaks, through collaborations with the DIll-D tokamak at General Atomics, the Alcator C-MOD tokamak at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and collaborations with major international fusion programs in Europe, Japan, China, and Korea. These activities contribute to the advancement of burning plasma physics and ITER. PPPL supports and participates in ITER, which is being constructed in Cadarache, France.  ITER will be an unprecedented international coIlaboration of seven partners involved in fusion research worldwide. PPPL will contribute hardware, manpower, and expertise to the ITER International Organization during its construction (ITER Project), and participate in burning plasma experiments on ITER during its operation. Although ITER is the penultimate fusion facility to a demonstration fusion power plant, other modest-scale facilities will be needed to focus on certain scientific and technology issues important to a fusion power plant.  Such facilities might include a materials test facility, a component test facility, or a high power tokamak designed to study plasma material interaction.  It is expected that PPPL will play an important role in the design and construction of these facilities, whether or not they are built at PPPL. PPPLs research activities also include the PPPL Theory Group, which plays an important role in the fusion projects of the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program.  PPPL is involved in several base SciDAC and Fusion Simulation Projects. In addition, PPPL performs other non-DOE sponsored research that is consistent with DOEs and PPPLs mission.  As a result of PPPLs technology transfer programs, industrial firms and other organizations benefit from PPPLs technological knowledge through the increased competitiveness of U.S. industry in the international marketplace. In addition to the aforementioned scientific responsibilities, the Contractor shall manage, operate, protect, maintain and enhance the Laboratorys ability to function as a DOE laboratory, provide the infrastructure and facilities to support the accomplishment of the Laboratorys missions, and assure accountability to the DOE. Anticipated annual funding for this contract is approximately $80 million. DOE expects to award a new performance-based contract during the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2008.  The base period of the contract will be five years. The proposed contract will contain a non-monetary performance incentive which will allow the selected offeror to earn up to an additional fifteen years of contract term for exemplary performance.  The potential term of the new contract is 20 years.  Following a sixty day transition period, the selected offeror will be expected to fully assume all management and operating responsibilities. All interested parties are requested to submit an Expression of Interest to Lisa Rogers, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, RFP Number DE-RP02-07CH11466, at the following e-mail address: lisa.rogers@ch.doe.gov. While there is no specific format required, please reference the RFP number, list the name of a contact with a telephone number and an e-mail address, state your interest as being either a prime or a subcontractor, state whether you are a small business, and if you are willing to have your expression of interest information published on the Source Evaluation Boards solicitation website. Submission of an Expression of Interest does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal.  Expressions of Interest should be received no later than 3:00 p.m. Central Time on May 25, 2007. Future information regarding this solicitation will be posted on DOEs Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or FedBizOpps at URL http://fedbizopps.gov.  DOE anticipates issuing a draft RFP in the fourth quarter of FY07.  The draft RFP will be open for comments or questions for approximately 30 days.  DOE expects to conduct a comment workshop, offer site tours and conduct one-on-one meetings with prospective offerors approximately three weeks after the draft RFP is issued. Following the issuance of the final RFP, DOE may host a pre-proposal conference. Dates and times for anticipated comment workshop, site tours, one-on-one meetings and the pre-proposal conference will be announced at a later date.

<DESC>The 526th ICBM System Program Office is seeking sources for manufacturing new High Impulse Transducer (HIT) Cables for the MK12A (Minuteman III Weapon System) re-entry vehicle.  This sources sought synopsis is for information and budget planning and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.
 
The MK12A Hit cable is a solid-state energy-conversion device, using a material that  by being electrically polarized will product a voltage output signal from the impact energy of a mechanical shock.  It is basically a high performance linear-seismic piezolectric accelerometer characterized by a resonant frequency, source capacitance and voltage sensitivity.  The HIT is mounted in the Reentry Vehicle (RV) nose and is subjected to the acceleration of the mounting surgace produced by the impact stree wave upon impact.  At this moment, the HIT transforms the mechanical shock into an electrical charge and sends it to the energy generator electronics.  It is mode of a piezo-ceramic crystal and a kovar seismic mass which is bonded to a connection wire that runs to the MK12A fuse.  Upon impact, the piezo-ceramic crystal is compressed by the mass producing a voltage output.

Possible procurement schedule would be 100 units in FY09; and Options of 50 each in FYs 10, 11, and 12.  Unclassified and non-proprietary documents will also be available upon request.   Direct all technical questions and responses to this sources sought to Miranda Pippin at 526th ICBMSW/PKA, Hill Air Force Base, UT 84056 or e-mailed to Miranda.Pippin@hill.af.mil.

Subfactor (b) The scientific/technical quality of the basic research or applied/exploratory research proposal and its relevance to the topic description, with special emphasis on its innovation and originality, and with consideration for the potential of the successful completion leading to further support by mainstream MDA/DV research programs, and 

Subfactor (c) Qualifications of the Principal Investigator, other key staff and consultants, if any, and adequacy of available or obtainable instrumentation and facilities; 

Management Factor:

Adequacy of management planning and controls; and 

Cost Factor:

Cost will be evaluated as follows:  

-  The proposals will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed.

-  Total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, and other cost related factors.   


EVALUATION FACTORS

Technical is the most important Factor (all Technical Subfactors are weighted equally).  The Management and Cost Factors are equal in weight, but are less important than Technical.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Aircraft Work Stands

This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers of Aircraft work/inspection stands/platforms described as follows:   

The USCG is looking for products, variously called work/check stands, inspection stands, and platforms.  Stands must be specifically built to the airframe dimensions of the CN235-300M aircraft, i.e., wing height, engine/prop height/width and horizontal/vertical stabilizer height/width and fuselage to landing gear sponson interface.  Stands must be transportable or semi-transportable for use on aircraft in performing major/minor inspections, maintenance in a hangar environment and for use in performing routine flight line maintenance.  Stands should require a maximum of 3 personnel to move.  Coast Guard is NOT looking for universal or multiple use check stands, ie, B1, B4A etc.  Coast Guard does not have blueprints of CN235-300M aircraft to provide to vendors.  Stands must meet applicable OSHA standards.

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options (to include setup and takedown services if available).  Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.  The Government believes the applicable Cage Codes are 333924 INDUSTRIAL TRUCK, TRACTOR, TRAILER, AND STACKER MACHINERY manufacturing, and 333999 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY MANUFACURING, and .  The size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 750 employees.  Also, please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC?s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC?s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.  After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD.     Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to CWO Dorsey Johr at Bldg 19, U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to Dorsey.H.Johr@uscg.mil.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received no later than May16th 2007 at 13:00 p.m. PST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice.  This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Managed Care Support Services - RFI - TIII
<DESC>In May 2006, a Special Notice was posted announcing that one-on-one meetings would be held in June 2006 to discuss the development of the third round of TRICARE managed care support contracts. 

The purpose of the current special notice is to advise interested parties of Department of Defense (DoD), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) plans for the follow-on procurement of its current Managed Care Support (MCS) contracts which conclude in March 2009.  TMA has developed requirements and is now preparing a draft solicitation for the follow-on contracts.  After publication of a separate special notice, TMA expects to release a draft solicitation for industry comment in May 2007.  After review and revision, a sources sought notice will be published announcing a formal solicitation.

In the meantime, TMA is currently making a variety of Military Health System (MHS) data available to interested parties for informational purposes.  MHS data will be available in two different levels of detail and will be made available using two separate media. First, summary level data is now available on the TMA industry forum website linked to this notice.  TMA expects to add or to periodically update the data posted on the webpage; therefore, all interested parties should check back frequently for updates. Second, detail level data files will also be available to potential sources. Ordering instructions for this level of data are posted at the TMA Industry Forum webpage.  Due to the size and content, detail level data sets can only be provided on external hard drives and will require payment of a processing fee of $1,500.00.  To obtain detailed level data the person(s) or party requesting it must complete the Non-Disclosure Agreement provided by TMA; and return it, along with a signed check made out to Treasurer of the United States, to TRICARE Management Activity, ATTN: Laura Morris, 16401 East Centretech Parkway, Aurora, CO 80011-9066.  Upon receipt, the detail level MHS data package will be sent to the requester.  It is anticipated that detail level data will be updated; so upon receipt of an external drive, recipients should download the data on-board and mail the drives back.  

Potential sources may pose questions regarding data under the Questions & Answer (Q&A) tab on the TMA Industry Forum webpage. TMA will post both the data questions and the TMA responses on the website.  Only questions regarding data will be considered at this time.

Section 5512 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Public Law 109-59, provides funding for the acceleration of the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) deployment, training on the use of TRANSIMS and development of new applications of TRANSIMS. The goal of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to support applied research and scientific study directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding to broaden the TRANSIMS user base and to provide for applications of TRANSIMS representing a diversity of populations, geographic regions and analytical methods. 

Multiple awards are possible and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has an interest not only in the individual offers but also in the selected projects collectively meeting the goals of the BAA. Therefore, this BAA solicitation will be conducted in two Phases, an optional Pre-proposal Phase and the Proposal Phase.  

The Pre-proposal Phase involves the submission of a short white paper describing the proposed project and partnering arrangements. FHWA will provide feedback on the white paper, making recommendations for changes to the project to better meet the requirements of the BAA solicitation. The Proposal Phase is the request for complete BAA proposal submissions. BACKGROUND. The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) is an agent-based travel simulation system designed to meet the State Department of Transportations? (DOTs') and Metropolitan Planning Organizations? (MPOs') need for more accurate and more sensitive travel forecasts for transportation planning and emissions analysis.  It consists of mutually supporting simulations, models, and databases.  By employing advanced computational and analytical techniques, it creates an integrated environment for regional transportation system analysis. Because TRANSIMS simulates and tracks travel by individuals, the benefits to and impacts on different geographies and travel markets can be evaluated as well. Furthermore, TRANSIMS has the capability to evaluate highly congested scenarios and operational changes on highways and transit systems. TRANSIMS differs from previous travel demand forecasting methods in its underlying concepts and structure. These differences include a consistent and continuous representation of time; a detailed representation of persons and households; time-dependent routing; and a person-based microsimulator. There are four primary modules: Population synthesizer, Activity generator, Route planner, and Traffic microsimulator. Using these components, a model may be constructed that estimates activities for individuals and households, plans trips satisfying those activities, assigns trips to routes, and creates a microsimulation of all persons, vehicles and resulting traffic on modeled transport systems in given study area. Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (http://www.lanl.gov) designed and developed the original TRANSIMS algorithms and software. The design for TRANSIMS is based on requirements in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Public Law (PL) 102-240), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (PL 105-178) as amended by the TEA 21 Restoration Act (PL 105-206), and the Clean Air Act of 1990 (PL 101-549) Amendments. The development of TRANSIMS has been funded by the Federal Highway Administration with support from the Federal Transit Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, and by the Environmental Protection Agency.

CURRENT STATUS. TRANSIMS development has proceeded along several lines. These include development of application methods, software and supporting utilities. Methods Development. Currently USDOT is sponsoring the development of a tour-based model, using TRANSIMS, in Portland, Oregon. The effort has been divided into two tracks: Track 1 uses existing trip tables, combined with the TRANSIMS Router and Microsimulator, to develop regional simulations of travel. The Track 1 effort has demonstrated that using network and trip table data currently available at most MPOs, regional simulations can be conducted. As part of the Track 1 effort utilities have been developed to convert existing networks and trip tables to TRANSIMS format. Track 2, currently underway, will develop tour based forecasting procedure based on the Portland transportation network and demand data available to the Portland MPO. Track 2 is expected to be completed by June of 2007. Software. The software and source code is now available under an the NASA Open Source Agreement v1.3. This license makes the source code publicly available and requires that any changes to the original code also be made publicly available. For further information on the license see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/nasa1.3.php.  
In addition to the core software, supporting utilities have been developed based on the work in Portland, these utilities include methods to convert node and link data into TRANSIMS format, to estimate intersection signalization and to assist with data preparation and application. The TRANSIMS software is written in standard C++. 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are available for Linux and Windows (pre-Vista). Support is available via documentation and forums on http://transims-opensource.net/index.php.  The source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims/.

OBJECTIVES. FHWA seeks to expand the knowledge, understanding and implementation of TRANSIMS capabilities and applications, and seeks to develop new approaches/tools/applications covering a diversity of methods, users and geographic area. Prospective offerors will submit proposals which: 1. Increase deployment of TRANSIMS, and/or 2. Broaden the TRANSIMS user base, and/or 3. Develop new applications of TRANSIMS. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS. The scope of this announcement is intentionally broad to invite innovation and to provide the FHWA the flexibility to sponsor research which best addresses its objectives.  In keeping with FHWA's desire for innovation and flexibility, the specific approach in the selected proposals will vary and will be negotiated.  Any resulting contracts will contain appropriate federal agency clauses for the type of procurement vehicle awarded.  Prior to award, the Offeror shall be required to submit 'Certifications and Representations.'  Data and reporting requirements will be negotiated with the firm(s) selected for award(s).  
As stated previously, the objectives of this solicitation are to expand the knowledge, understanding and implementation of TRANSIMS capabilities and applications, develop new approaches/tools/applications covering a diversity of methods, users and geographic area which will increase TRANSIMS deployment, broaden the user base and to develop new applications. Multiple awards are anticipated and offers will be selected so as to meet these objectives individually as well as collectively. That is, individual offers may be stronger in specific objectives and taken as a whole the selected offers will support all objectives. The proposal submission shall be conducted in two phases; 1) an optional Pre-proposal Phase for FHWA review and comment, and 2) The Proposal Phase which is the request for complete BAA proposal submissions. 

Pre-proposal Phase
To improve the quality of proposals, offerors may submit a short Pre-proposal describing their proposed work and partnering arrangements. The Pre-proposals shall address the problem statement, workplan, data sources, rough order of magnitude (ROM) budget, staffing and planned agency support (Formal agency support is not required at this time although we suggest that the Pre-proposals be coordinated with the agency). Offerors should refer to the BAA Evaluation Criteria to ensure that their Pre-proposal addresses the FHWA's requirements.  The pre-proposals shall include: BAA Number, project title, name of organization, principal investigator and contact information on the first page. After receiving the Pre-proposals, FHWA will provide comments to offerors on strengths and weaknesses of the proposed projects and make recommendations for changes in the final submission. FHWA shall make all material submitted as part of a pre-proposal and feedback on specific proposals confidential. The material shall not distributed to other offerors.  Pre-proposals are limited to four single sided typewritten pages, double spaced, 12 point font, with one inch margins on all sides and shall be in Microsoft Word 2003 or equivalent, or Adobe portable document format (pdf).  Offerors may submit a proposal without having submitted a Pre-proposal.  Pre-proposals must be submitted via electronic mail, and must be received by FHWA on or before 4:00 PM (local time) on May 17, 2007.  Facsimile transmissions or hard copy transmissions of the Pre-proposal will not be accepted. Pre-proposals shall be sent to rick.murray@fhwa.dot.gov and to melissa.rosendorf@fhwa.dot.gov. Comments will be provided to offerors by June 1, 2007.  

PROPOSAL PHASE. Refer to the attached solicitation package for detailed instructions. 
CONTRACT PERIOD. The contract period is negotiable but shall be no more than 18 months from date of award.

CLARIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Experience in running TRANSIMS is desirable but not essential. Funding must be sufficient to cover the scope of the proposed project. Additional resources from other than Federal sources are encouraged. Applications will be evaluated on the ability to accomplish the offeror's proposed scope and resources. Since the overall goal is the dissemination of TRANSIMS and building a TRANSIMS user community, consortiums of applicants are encouraged. Consortiums may include, but are not limited to, combinations of consulting firms, universities and MPOs or State DOTs. All proposals must have the endorsement of a planning agency and a process for the planning agency to review results. Consortiums may be led by a university, a consulting firm or a planning agency.
The Department of Transportation is developing a TRANSIMS installation package which will include TRANSIMS software, test set ups to support the installation of the software and test data sets. Offerors are expected to provide problem data and computer capability. Each proposal shall include an initial task to install TRANSIMS and successfully verify installation using the test procedures and data prior to commencement of the rest of the project. In the event the installation package is not complete at the time of the award, commencement of the project will be delayed until the package is available. Peer reviews will play a key role in deployment. These peer reviews will be funded and implemented separately from the deployment funding, however Offerors should budget and schedule resources for preparation and presentation as well as commenting on the peer review report. An initial peer review will be conducted upon completion of the base year model to examine approach, calibration, and validation results. If the work plan includes additional scenarios or future forecasts, the initial peer review will also include the plans for implementing and applying the additional model capability. A final peer review will be conducted upon completion of the analysis. Each peer review is expected to last no more than two days and be comprised of no more than five peers. Awards are anticipated to be made prior to September 30, 2007.

EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS AND AWARD EVALUATION CRITERIA. Proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria specified herein through a peer review process.  The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funding availability.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Technical factors are more important than cost factors, and technical evaluation will be based on the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 1. Ability to complete the proposed work within available resources, 2. Level of commitment by the planning agency to the proposed project. One of the primary objectives of this deployment is the use of TRANSIMS by planning agencies. Use does not necessarily mean installing and running TRANSIMS but does imply integrating the results of TRANSIMS into the agency decision-making process. It is not expected for agencies to immediately commit to the use of TRANSIMS, but priority will be given to agencies, which express an interest in the use of the results, 3. Broadening of the TRANSIMS user community - While agencies use the results of model, universities and consulting firms play a critical role in the dissemination of new technologies. Universities play a role through research and training of students on transportation planning methods. Consultants have developed most of the models in use in the United States. Proposals, which involve Universities, consultants or others, who play a major role in technology deployment are encouraged; 4. The ability of the proposed analyses to take advantage of TRANSIMS capabilities. TRANSIMS is a new technology with new capabilities. Offerors should carefully review the capabilities of TRANSIMS and identify how those capabilities address the proposed application.

Offerors should address in full each of the above criteria in Part I, Technical Proposal.  The comprehensiveness and quality of the proposed research study, especially the completeness of the proposed work plan, will contribute significantly in the selection process, and innovative solutions, approaches and techniques which address the stated objectives will be considered.  The offeror's ability to identify technical needs and to design a study to meet these needs within budget are essential skills in the accomplishment of the announcement objectives.  The FHWA reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals submitted.

AWARD CRITERIA. The Government anticipates that approximately $600,000 will be dedicated to this program, subject to availability of funds, and anticipates making multiple awards.  It is anticipated that no single proposal will be funded for more than $300,000 in federal funds.  This Broad Agency Announcement does not commit the Government to pay for response preparation costs.

ELIGIBILITY. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the FHWA.  Consortium arrangements and industrial partnering agreements are encouraged.

Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

The current training POI for Technical Emergency Response Training (TERT), Hands-On-Training (HOT), Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Complexities, and ER HazMat requires the incorporation of the APD2000 in the training for these courses. The training department requires 26 additional units to have sufficient equipment to support the off-site courses at remote locations.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  The requirement is posted in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested APD2000 dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the acquisition.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon the expectation that sufficient competition will be obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps and comparison to the vendor's commercial product price list.    

8.  Description of Market Research.  Full scale market research was not conducted, however, research through query of internet sites failed to disclose any manufacturers of comparable items.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The use of the APD2000 in the training environment is essential for our emergency responders to ensure all training is conducting using the same equipment whether on-site resident training or off-site courses conducted at remote locations.

10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is an authorized distributor/dealer for the APD2000. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.

11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.  We will continue to conduct market research periodically to determine if comparable sources/products are available.

RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FROM PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR

1. Memory Line item p/n 343057-12G is a ML370 memory chip of 6x2GB.  This is not recommended by HP and would void the warranty. I need to have an explanation from them why they choose this chip for the ML570 whereas they are indicating exact specs for image. And if not, what chip did the mean? 
RESPONSE: Memory Line item part number is changed to read 343057-B21

2.  The HP Controller Array P400/256 PCIe controller 405132-B21 Is the controller for the ML370.  The ML570 comes with the same controller but 512 cache.  It takes up a slot.  Is it that they are requesting a second controller with less cache because of the image?  or would like two controllers?  
RESPONSE: HP Smart Array P400/256 Controller 405132-B21 is the controller specified by Hewlett-Packard for the ML570.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address potential offerors questions.

Question 1:  Are there suppose to be deliverables annotated for CLIN0007?

Answer to Question 1:  CLIN 0007 is for the extended warranty.

Question 1:  Should the Specifications designate that the Nd:YAG is required for bruiting of the diamond instead of cutting as called out in the Specifications.
 
Answer to Question 1: The specification is for cutting, not bruiting. While I understand the issue with transparent samples such as diamond and glass, I am under the impression that transparent samples could be marked with a colored marker to unable cutting by a Nd:YAG laser.

2.      Question 2:   Can you please provide clarification of what is to be done to the glass with the Nd:YAG?

 Answer to Question 2: Please see answer to Question 1

Question 3: Please provide clarification on item 12 referring to a saw cut. Is this supposed to refer to a laser cut instead of the saw cut?
 
Answer to Question 3:  The statement requests a demonstration of the ability of the laser to cut through and across a silicon wafer from edge to edge as a 'cutting saw' would do. 

Question 4:  Is the solicitation unrestricted?

Answer to Question 4:  Yes the solicitation is unrestricted.

Question 5:  Would NRL consider making the solicitation a Small Business Set-aside?

Answer to Question 5:  No the solicitation will remain unrestricted.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 to Reference Number SB3100-7085-3008 on the stationary pallet inverter is issued to answer the following question:

Question - My engineers need to make sure that what you are requesting will work with the type of equipment we are quoting.  Therefore, it is necessary to know the type of product, max weight and sequence of operations (i.e. how the product is being put on and taken off the inverter), etc.  

Answer:  The application is for re-palletizing incoming loads.  The maximum weight is 4000 lb.
 
The sequence of operations is as follows:
    1.  A forklift driver will place the pallet/load on the inverter
    2.  A new/proper pallet is placed on top of the load
    3.  The inverter clamps the whole load, plus new pallet
    4.  The inverter rotates the load 180 degrees so that the load rests on the new pallet
    5.  The clamps are released
    6.  The old pallet is removed from the top
    7.	The forklift driver removes the re-palletized load

Quotation due and time shall remain May 1, 2007 @ 2:00 PM local time.
 
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
