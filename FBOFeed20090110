This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requiresGovernment source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flightcritical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate tosupport acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you mustsubmit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the"https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" Naval Inventory Control Point PhiladelphiaSource Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical datarequired to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of thesame or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.

Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
