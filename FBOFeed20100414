<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL anticipates awarding a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order to Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz (RWMS) AG Birch Strasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395. It is anticipated that the total purchase order period of performance will not exceed five (5) months from time of award and will have an estimated value of $100,000.00. The USAF will procure Tungsten alloy raw materials for approximately 1650 rounds of Rheinmetall 25mm x 137mm FAP ammunition to evaluate firing performance with respect to the GAU-22/A gun/ammunition/aircraft interface requirements. <br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The authority for this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1: Agency requirements can only be met by one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with DFARS 206.302-1, this authority is applicable as it may be used for "acquisitions of test articles and associated support services from a designated foreign source under the DoD Foreign Comparative Testing Program." The USAF has been authorized to conduct a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program by OSD to evaluate and qualify a 25mm x 137 Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) round for the USAF Joint Strike Fighter's GAU-22/A gun system. <br />The candidate FAP round chosen for this FCT is developed and manufactured by (RWMS), formerly Oerlikon Contraves Pyrotec AG. An ammunition study was conducted in 2005. The result of this exhaustive study was that only ammunition proposed by Rheinmetall satisfied both effectiveness and safety requirements. Market Research completed in 2008 as part of the FCT confirmed Rheinmetall ammunition to be the only suitable choice available. As a result, the government selected the Rheinmetall 25mm x 137mm FAP round for the FCT project. The materials acquired under this purchase order are specialized materials required for the manufacture of the Rheinmetall FAP round.<br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422. Collect calls will not be accepted. The alternate Ombudsman is Colonel Lawrence G. Avery, Jr. AAC/CS, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422.<br />For subcontracting opportunities, please contact Oskar Brodmann, 41443163741 or Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz AG, Birch Strasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395.<br />Please forward any written statements of eligibility to 685 ARSS, Attn: Lt Jamesina Stuppy, 207 West D Avenue, Bldg 349, Suite 626, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6864, or facsimile (850) 882-7983 or e-mail Jamesina.Stuppy@eglin.af.mil.<br />

<p>All individuals and/or firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quotes being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer, Ms. Terry Clark (316-759-4525) for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).  A future solicitation/contract may provide PBL support and management services for the CMWS, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR>BACKGROUND: The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard all rotary wing and most fixed wing aircraft.  It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a US Army Acquisition Category ID (ACAT ID) program.  The CMWS program is satisfying the Armys requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems.  The CMWS is the Aviation IR Survivability capability provider for the Future Force.  It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivablity Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection.  Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles.  The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently there are 12 system versions.  <BR>The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions.  The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE.  In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems.  Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile.  Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).  The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat.  If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD).  Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots.  If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers.  The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and then send a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution.  Providing the CMWS is armed, a Flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction.  The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) or CI, located in the cockpit, provides the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS.  The DCDU and CI display system status information, Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) inventory, and software version number.  In the event of an ECU failure, the MODE switch on the DCDU can be set to BYPASS to allow manual dispensing of munitions.  <BR>The CMWS is currently supported through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance.  In accordance with Title 10, USC statutes, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) repairs the ECU through a subcontract with the OEM.  Organic repair capability (through TYAD) for the EOMS will be established and will commence with a target date of 1QTR FY12.  The approved Army Procurement Objective is 3,916 A-Kits and 2,002 B-Kits.  B-Kits are issued as Mission Kits to Aviation Units being deployed into threat environments, and to select OCONUS-based units as directed by HQDA, DCS/G-3.  The Mission Kit Concept allows a smaller population of CMWS B-Kits to accomplish the desired mission, and places control of the B-Kits at a higher decision authority.  B-Kits not installed are stored in a centralized location.  Technical Data is available and can be provided upon request.  The anticipated PBL contract will cover supply chain management of the B-Kit, and potentially the A-Kit, engineering support, core depot capability, Packaging, Handing, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T) and program management.  Software sustainment will transition to the CECOM Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team (ARAT).  Some collaboration/interface between the PBL contractor and the OEM and/or CECOM ARAT may be required.<BR>This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease CMWS sustainment costs, improve CMWS sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainment readiness for CMWS customers.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR>OBJECTIVE: This office will utilize a full service PBL contract implemented through a Public Private Partnership.  The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) (responsible for integrating all sources of support defined within the scope of the PBL contract to achieve desired outcomes) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSP) (service providers involved in sustainment of an acquisition system).  This office is searching for the best commercial source to serve as a Product Support Provider.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <BR>The USG contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15 that may result in the award of a five-year Fixed Price Incentive contract.  Estimated award date is NLT  2QTRFY11.  PM IRCM will serve as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI).  PSP Partnerships (in addition to a required Commercial Services Agreement with TYAD) are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for product support is identified.  This office plans to transition management of select A-Kit materials to DLA.  PM IRCM intends for the commercial PSP to partner with DLA through a non-binding partnering agreement to manage those items IAW FAR Part 51.  <BR>RESPONSES: Responses will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this PBL effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry Day.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to procure services for the destruction and removal of storm damaged Temporary Housing Units (THU) for the following sites.
<p>Lottie Number of THU's<br />5310 Old State Highway (47)<br />Lottie, LA 70756</p>

<p>Sherwood (20)<br />2695 N Sherwood Drive<br />Baton Rouge, LA 708114</p>
<p><br />The services include cleaning, destruction and removal of THU's located in FEMA Staging Yards. Destruction and removal will occur on an as-needed basis, as determined by FEMA. THU's may be travel trailers, park model mobile homes or full-size mobile homes. The "destruction" phase of the work may require removal of hazardous materials (e.g., kitchen, bath, and laundry cleaners, household items such as paints, oils, batteries, etc.) Various recyclable components such as aluminum and copper may have salvage value and FEMA understands that the successful contractor may recycle these materials to their own benefit. It is FEMA's intent that all units are cleared of all hazardous debris, broken down and destroyed, and all components, including the frame, be removed from the site.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a single award may result from the solicitation, issuance of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (with one base year and four one-year option periods). However, the government reserves the right to make multiple awards. The Government will use Far Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items. Interested parties may indentify their interest and capacity to satisfy the Government's requirement by contacting the Contract Specialist at Toye.Hobday@dhs.gov. It is the Government's intent to generate a bidder's mailing list. However, interested parties are responsible for monitoring the site to assure that they have the most up to date information regarding this requirement. The solicitation will be issued in the same manner as the pre-solicitation.</p>

<DESC><p>Provide all labor, supervision, equipment and material to provide analytical services to support several acoustic research cruises to the Dry Tortugas region (SE Gulf of Mexico). The research cruises will involve intensive scuba operations, and both active and passive acoustic analysis of fish movements and patterns. The planned 2010 research cruises are not only a critical continuation of the reserve assessment research, but a move in a new research direction as well. The research cruises will be conducted in the Dry Tortugas region of SW FL (SE Gulf of Mexico). Cruise operations will be conducted over a total of three cruises, each of three days duration, for a total of nine days. Operations will support scuba-based surveys of reef fish, the long-term deployment of passive acoustic listening devices (digital spectrum recorders, or DSRs) as well as overnight deployment of low-light video-cameras, and the towing of active hydroacoustic sonar. This research will facilitate the 1) timing and magnitude of spawning aggregations in the Tortugas Ecological Reserves and their association with their habitat, and 2) the assessment of recovery of these previously exploited spawning aggregations of commercially important reef fishes since their protection from excessive fishing pressure.&nbsp; Biological data will be collected by SCUBA divers using non-destructive, in situ, fishery independent visual monitoring methods. The scientific investigators are uniquely qualified to conduct this research based on past research and experience in the study area. The proposed sampling survey will obtain visual census transect samples to quantify the numbers of important species in the reef fish complex (snappers and groupers). This work requires a labor-intensive effort with no shortcuts to ensure that sampling is cost-effective and precise. Low light surveillance cameras housed in underwater housing will be deployed at in the afternoon and retrieved the next morning, with the goal the recording of grouper spawning events. Long term passive acoustic recording devices, digital spectrum recorders, will be deployed at the initiation of each cruise, retrieved, downloaded and redeployed at the end of the cruise. Lastly, scientists will tow hydroacoustic sonar gear during evening transects for the purpose of 1) characterizing the habitat type, and 2) searching for likely aggregations of fishes that could be spawning aggregations, for later exploration using SCUBA gear. Diving operations shall require nine full operational days. The vendor will provide expertise in the deployment and analysis of data collected by the digital spectrum recorders. The vendor shall provide personnel proficient in SCUBA techniques and possessing NOAA Diving program reciprocity. These personnel should be proficient in working underwater, using Nitrox breathing medium. These personnel shall be comfortable in working in an offshore environment for extended periods of time. Experience is needed in the proper placement and deployment of underwater camera housings and digital spectrum recorders. Proficiency in using the analytical software package MATLAB for the analysis of acoustic data to interpret presence/absence of grouper sounds is required. Since this study is biologically linked to the timing of the full moon during these months, the vendor or his personnel shall be available for dive operations during or near the cruise dates listed in this solicitation. The vendor will provide the results of the acoustic data collected on each cruise to National Marine Fisheries, Beaufort, NC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Period of Performance: April 23, 2010, or date of award, whichever is later, through April 30, 2011. This acquisition will be issued as an RFQ and awarded as a firm-fixed price order under simplified acquisition procedures. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov, and obtain (and provide with the offer) a DUNS number by calling 1-800-333-0505.

FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Per FAR 6.302-1 Split Rock Studios is the only responsible vendor able to maintain and fix the DVC exhibits at Denali National Park. Vendor Split Rock Studios created and placed all exhibits in the Denali Visitor Center in 2005 and because of this, their expertise is unmatched when it comes to cleaning and maintaining their own creations. 
2. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.Clean, repair and maintain visitor center exhibits: Train staff to ensure the National Park Service can clean and maintain the exhibits in the future.
3. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.):  Since Split Rock Studios were contracted to create the exhibits they are the only company that know the compounds used, design parameters, cleaning guidelines, etc. Since Split Rock staff created the exhibits they are the most qualified to train others on the cleaning and maintenance.
4. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Further market research was not necessary because exhibits were originally created by Split Rock Studios. 
5. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: N/A
6. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: Competitive bid awarded and work completed in 2005.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFACSW) intends to award a contract to one source (Southern California Gas Co.) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913, which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utility companies to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utility companies) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation.  
NOTE:  The solicitation will not be made available on this website.
This notice is provided for information purposes only therefore FAR 5.203 does not apply.  This opportunity is available only to the utility contractor servicing San Nicolas Island under a Utilities Energy Service Contract (UESC) N62473-09-G-5012, Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), for the installation, replacement, renovation, repair, operation and maintenance of energy conservation measures and consuming equipment.  Services shall include, but not be limited to, upgrades to Facilities Management Systems (FMS), installation of energy management systems and direct digital controls, implementation of energy conservation measures, and limited Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services for any energy savings devices and technologies installed under any Delivery Order awarded under this BOA at various navy facilities within the service territory of Southern California Gas Co.
Project Description:
The proposed procurement is to install an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) PROJECT - TAS::17 1805::TAS - PROJECT NUMBER P0885, WIND TURBINE GENERATION, SAN NICOLAS ISLAND, funded project to install Phase II of a three phase project adding four 100-kW Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) on San Nicolas Island.  The WTGs will offset the costs of the JP-5 fuel that is transported by barge to San Nicolas Island to fuel the existing diesel power plant.  This project is the second phase of a three phase construction project to install a total of nine 100-kW WTGs and an energy storage system on San Nicolas Island.   Specific incentives being offered by Southern California Gas Co. for implementation of this project are engineering services to perform a feasibility study and engineering design for the installation of supplemental heating devices on select facilities on SNI that could take advantage of excess energy produced from the WTG's during low system demand periods.  This effort will build upon the Southern California Gas Co.'s Facility Load Shedding Program Audit performed during the Phase I design.

<DESC>Aircraft certification (civil) and airworthiness qualification (military) testing assesses an aerial vehicles performance and handling qualities for all flight regimes (e.g., take-off, landing, cruise, hover, autorotation, etc.).  Flight in icing conditions is one of the flight environments that must be tested.  For over 30 years, the Army has used the CH-47 hosted Helicopter Icing Spray System to provide military and civilian aircraft designers with an artificial icing cloud as a faster, lower cost, lower risk alternative to natural icing testing in instrumented meteorological conditions.  This requirement will be for the acquisition of the CGS which will replace the current HISS.  The CGS is expected to provide several significant improvements to the HISS.  These include improved cloud characteristics, larger spray array for full rotor immersion, a spray array for full fuselage immersion, palletized design to alleviate the requirement for a dedicated highly modified CH-47D.  The successful contractor(s) will be responsible for design, development, fabrication, integration, and test of both the permanently installed on-aircraft equipment (A-Kit) and the on-aircraft removable mission equipment (B-Kit).   The CGS B-kit consists of a water spray system with integral water storage that, when installed, converts the CH-47 into an icing tanker that produces artificial clouds used for ice or rain testing.  The spray boom delivers the water to the nozzles which spray the water to form the cloud.  Additional subsystems include the spray controls, boom control, station keeping/pilot cueing, mechanical aircraft interface, and safety equipment.   The CGS kit will be capable of being installed on any CH-47D or F Model with minimal-to-no permanent aircraft modifications (A-kit), allowing the host aircraft to maintain a multi-role mission capability.  Additionally, the successful contractor(s) will be responsible for supporting Government Air Worthiness Certification and testing of the system.<BR><BR>The OHISS competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with the utilization of best value trade off procedures.  The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) Class Code is 336414.  The small business size standard is 1000 employees (this is only applicable to small business offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition).  This solicitation will result in the award of a single Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract (CPFF).  The Bidders Library for this effort can be accessed by contacting the Contract Specialist listed below.  PEO STRI anticipates issuing the draft RFP  electronically on FedBizOpps in May 2010.  <BR><BR>The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for any  Bid & Proposals (B&P) costs for offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.<BR><BR>Please direct all correspondence to Corretta M. Benton, Contract Specialist by electronic mail at corretta.benton@us.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The space will be occupied by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment. Agency requires 2 reserved and 5 general parking spaces for "in and out" business for program purposes.
<p>BUILDING REQUIREMENT:<br />The facility must be professional in appearance, well maintained, of modern design, and of sound and substantial construction. The space shall be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, alcoholic establishments, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads. Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare will not be considered in the following instances: (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block; or (2) if access to the location is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks (or an equivalent distance) from the proposed office space. Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible. Space shall not be located within a base floodplain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.</p>

Elevator service must consist of a minimum of two industrial, handicap accessible elevators (only one may serve as a freight elevator).</p>
<p>Public transportation, if available, must be within two blocks of the space. In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space. Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed. "Reasonable rates" will be determined by local pricing levels.</p>
<p><br />LOCATION / DELINEATED AREA:<br />The building offered must be located within the city of Texarkana, TX.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:<br />The term is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm.</p>

<DESC>Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services
The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services for the renovation of the Everett McKinley Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago, Illinois. Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the 30-story Dirksen Courthouse, located at 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, was completed in 1964. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $70,000,000 to $80,000,000. The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin in March 2007. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project. 

The project scope of work consists of upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system (renovation/replacement of the entire perimeter induction unit system), restroom renovation, fire-alarm replacement, asbestos/lead based paint abatement, and tenant alterations. The tenant alterations will consist of building out approximately 170,000 square feet of vacant space (3 full floors and 1 partially occupied floor) to provide for increasing space requirements for court related or other federal agencies. The building was placed on the National Historic Register in 1974. Therefore, the design and construction shall comply with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (NPHA).

The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Pre-Construction phase services with the Construction phase services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option. This will be a firm, fixed-price contract. A firm, fixed price for the general construction services will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction phase option. 

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value trade-off process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. As part of the CMc Pre-construction phase services (Base contract), the CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: evaluating design concepts, reviewing designs, evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phasing of work, resolving problems, participating in value engineering (VE) exercises, preparing commissioning plans as determined by a 3rd party commissioning agent, working with a LEED consultant to prepare for LEED certification, conducting constructability reviews, developing subcontractor and supplier interest, identifying long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work. The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, the contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

The Construction phase services (Option) of this project shall include, but is not limited to, administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc's internal personnel or under subcontract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, commissioning and other required LEED services. The CMc shall work with the A/E and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.

Small Business Participation: This is a negotiated procurement open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $28.5 million.

In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).

<DESC><BR>Overview.  The Government is seeking information to determine industrys capability to produce Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), AN/TPQ-50 systems. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s).  Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>Description.  The AN/TPQ-50 is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The system consists of an Antenna and Radar Cylinder that is powered by battery or external generator.  Data processing is performed by the Radar Processor (RP) and Remote Laptop.  The AN/TPQ-50 is an improved version of the AN/TPQ-49 and provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets, has improved accuracy for mortars, is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent HMMWV, is assembled and emplaced either on or off the vehicle by a two person team and is interoperable with systems as described in the Performance Specification for the Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), AN/TPQ-50 dated October 2009.  The specification is attached in the Links to Drawings section of the IBOP Market Research Page.  The Government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package for the AN/TPQ-50.<BR><BR>Acquisition Strategy.  The Government proposes to acquire AN/TPQ-50 systems (to include float quantities) and initial spares for the US Army and, possibly, other organizations.  Contract(s) will also include provisions to enable the Contractor and the Government to react quickly if any engineering changes become warranted.  Based on current mission priorities, the government considers the following criteria to be most important:  delivery schedule, technical performance, cost, supportability, potential technology enhancements, reliability growth and production capacity. The Government is seeking potential respondents who can demonstrate the existing AN/TPQ-50 performance and provide first deliveries within 12 months of any contract award (or 9 months if the government provides the LN-270 or equivalent inertial navigation systems as GFE).  A 5 year production contract is planned for award in FY12. Prior to contract award, potential offerors will be required to demonstrate their product in a government test.

5. MARKET VALUE:  $80,728 - $118,552
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: June 2010 - May 2011 (extendable up to 4 yrs)
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Port-au-Prince, Haiti
8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:

This position is located in the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Narcotics Affairs Section, Embassy Port-au-Prince.  The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and on international criminal justice and law enforcement issues for the Department of State.

Under the supervision of the U.S. Embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) Director, this Personal Services Contract (PSC) position provides senior level advice and guidance to the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) at the American Embassy in Port au Prince, Haiti in the implementation of bilateral U.S. Government (USG) and Government of Haiti (GOH) capacity- building, law enforcement and international narcotics control (INC) projects.  

The primary mission of INL is the development of policies and management of programs to combat international narcotics production and trafficking, combat international crime and terrorism, and strengthen law enforcement and other rule of law institutional capabilities outside the United States. INL does this through a comprehensive range of bilateral, regional, and global initiatives and assistance programs to set international counterdrug and anti-crime standards, foster cooperation among states, and build up the law enforcement capacity of foreign governments.  The programs enable foreign governments to act directly against traffickers and other crime groups and cooperate more effectively with U.S. law enforcement agencies. 

The Haitian National Police have little real capacity to investigate or respond to crimes, conduct patrols, keep public order or even communicate internally.  These basic prerequisites for enforcing the law are lacking throughout Haiti, but particularly in Port au Prince slums which are the epicenter of gang and criminal activity.  An estimated eighty metric tons of cocaine from South America transits the island of Hispaniola on its way to U.S. markets.  Cocaine arrives in Haiti by go-fast boats, other vessels and by small aircraft.  It is then shipped onward by sea in vessels or containers or by land through the Dominican Republic.  In addition to posing problems for the U.S., the drug trade in Haiti undermines the rule of law in that fragile country by fostering corruption and fomenting armed violence perpetrated by criminal gangs and political opposition groups.  

Strengthening Haitis law enforcement capacity is a key U.S. priority.  Improved security is critical to strengthening democracy, providing stability, establishing an environment for economic growth and investment, improving respect for human rights, and reducing drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and other transnational crime.  The INL program focuses on the development of an honest, professional and effective police and corrections force.  To stem the drug flow through Haiti, we have partnerships with Haitian authorities and are creating institutions to fight both drug trafficking and related money laundering.  In addition, the INL criminal justice program supports improvements to the infrastructure and management of the prison system.   

Stability in Haiti will contribute to its economic growth, enhancing security in the region and diminishing the attractiveness of illegal migration to the U.S.  To help achieve stability, the INL program also supports peacekeeping operations, including by providing U.S. police and corrections officers to the civilian police and corrections component of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the lead player in HNP and corrections reform and retraining.  
The Senior Advisor assists the NAS Director in the implementation of the program involving host government counterparts and other agency USG personnel. The NAS staff comprises three USG direct hire employees, local FSNs, and U.S. personal services contract personnel. These positions include top level professionals engaged in political reporting and project management; technical administrative experts involved in engineering, construction, facilities management, accountants and contract specialists; and a variety of support personnel. 

The NAS is also responsible for implementation of the Haiti portion of the Merida Initiative -- a multi-year $1.4 Billion regional initiative to break the power of criminal organizations; strengthen border, air, and maritime controls from the Southwest border of the United States to Panama; improve the capacity of justice systems in the region to conduct investigations and prosecutions; consolidate the rule of law, protect human rights, and reform prison management; curtail criminal gang activity; and reduce the demand for drugs throughout the region.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The Government seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information regarding possible suppliers who can provide and intermediate grade gasoline which complies with most of the Israeli standard requirements and would be fixed at an Israeli refinery in order to comply with all the requirements.

Appendix A contains the latest version of the I.D.F. technical specification for unleaded gasoline.  The specification is used year-round.

Appendix B is an example of an intermediate grade gasoline.  Other proposals will be considered.

Appendix C contains the original requirements for seasonal properties which are acceptable.

The proposed product shall be the closest to the Israeli specification as possible; requiring only the simplest process/blending at an Israeli refinery.  For example, adding MTBE at the lowest possible concentration.

The proposed product shall fully comply with all the specification requirements that could not be fixed, such as the sulfur content.

Deviations from the specification will only be approved for properties such as the octane number, RVP, etc.

The estimated yearly requirement is 13,500,000 gallons, shipped in approximately two equal shipments.  However, these quantities could changed based on the needs of the end user.  For example, in lieu of two equal shipments, one shipment could consist of 4,000,000 gallons and the next shipment 9,500,000 gallons.  Potential offerors should state the minimum parcel size in the response.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought

A.	General Information.  

The Northeast Region (TRBO Reg. 1), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia including institutional and operational healthcare settings announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AED).  This product line includes but is not limited to the Automated External Defibrillators (AED) which includes a portable carrying case; a long-life disposable battery pack; adult  and pediatric electrode pads; ECG tracing capability; instantaneous compression data to help the rescuer with the proper rate and depth; delivery of  appropriate defibrillation energy levels; ability to distinguish between adult and pediatric rescue; graphical interface of pictures combined with text displays and/or voice prompts; internal memory and external USB memory technology for expanded data storage and transfer capacity; and an accessory kit that include Nitrile gloves, powder-free, cuffed; pocket breathing mask; paramedic scissors; disposable safety razor; and large, extra-absorbent paper towel.  
Additionally, this product line includes a Crash Cart Defibrillator that has a combination of programmable text prompts, audible alarms and visible indicators; biphasic escalating shock energy technology that automatically adjusts the magnitude of the defibrillation shock based upon each patients unique body type; a wide variety of electrodes and paddles for adults and pediatric patients;  switch internal paddles for open-heart defibrillation; 3-lead patient cable with integral lead wires; universal cable; a rechargeable battery;  event documentation/ data transfer capabilities via internal memory; and heart rhythm analysis and shock advice to effectively address life-threatening arrhythmias. 
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  It is possible that the devices may have to be purchased direct from the vendor but all recurring accessories will be ordered through the Prime Vendor.  It is also noted that the equipment is ordered cyclical or on an as-needed basis when budgeted to outfit a facility or specific area.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; Dewitt Health Care Network, Fort Belvoir, VA; and National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  
Point of Contact: Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil.  

B.	Products & Performance Required.  

The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AED) which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $90,113 for the accessories.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The Northeast Region estimates needing 200 AED devices based on past purchases and future requirements for the new hospitals.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown below:

PHILIPS MEDICAL	M3716A	HEARTSTREAM ADULT RADIOLUCENT PADS
PHILIPS MEDICAL	M3717A	HEARTSTREAM PEDIATRIC PLUS PADS MULTI-FUNCTION
ZOLL MEDICAL	8900-4003	STAT PADZ HVP MULTI-FUNCTION ELECTRODES
ZOLL MEDICAL	8900-2065	PAD ELECTRODE PED 6S PK/6
PHILIPS MEDICAL	M1625A	SHIELDED 5-LEAD SET; SNAPS
PHYSIO-CONTROL	11141-000026	LIFEPAK NiCd BATTERY
PHILIPS MEDICAL	989803158211	 PAD ADULT DEFIBRILLATION FR2
PHILIPS MEDICAL	M3863A	BATTERY, LONG LIFE LIMNO
PHILIPS MEDICAL	M1520A	TRUNK CABLE, 5 LEAD, SAFETY
ZOLL MEDICAL	8000-0294	LNCS ADULT REUSABLE SENSOR

At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors.  

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil or  Tracy Martin-Tilghman, (202) 782-3663, tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil as a back-up.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors who fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors who fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  

Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to toni.massenburg@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price proposed package discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  
a.	At a minimum this includes an AED device that automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed; has real time spoken and visual CPR and shock prompts and/or visual ECG readout displays to instruct the rescuer; has both adult and pediatric defibrillation capability and per-gelled, self-adhesive, disposable pads; has biphasic technology; is simple to use; has built in event memory data storage; has a long-life disposable battery; performs self tests; is lightweight, portable, and can withstand drops and environmental conditions that meet our specifications; and any other products in this category. 
b.	At a minimum this also includes a Crash Cart Defibrillator that has a combination of programmable text prompts, audible alarms and visible indicators; biphasic escalating shock energy technology that automatically adjusts the magnitude of the defibrillation shock based upon each patients unique body type; a wide variety of electrodes and paddles for adults and pediatric patients;  switch internal paddles for open-heart defibrillation; 3-lead patient cable with integral lead wires; universal cable; a rechargeable battery;  event documentation/ data transfer capabilities via internal memory; and heart rhythm analysis and shock advice to effectively address life-threatening arrhythmias and any other products in this category.  
Vendors are required to supply the items listed below only if approved to progress to 
            Phase II  Clinical Evaluation Phase.

Product requested	Number of Items	Best product description
Automated External Defibrillator (AED)	1	Automated, external, defibrillator with adult and pediatric capability
Crash Cart Defibrillator	1	Biphasic defibrillator with a wide variety of defibrillation and monitoring functions


c.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply items listed in all product ranges, configurations, capabilities, sizes, and durability. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).
2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  
3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Automated External Defibrillators (AED) in the Northeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. 
4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors who fail to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.
5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.    
6.

Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:
Clinical/Performance Evaluations
1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request no-cost product sample sets from the product group to be hand carried directly to the participating Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) where the evaluations are to occur.	
Vendors will be allowed 7 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the 
arrangements for inservice/demonstration.  Product samples must be hand delivered to the 
participating MTF addresses and points of contact by the morning of the appointed 
demonstration/inservice day.    Vendors who do not meet the deadline to hand deliver the 
product samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  
Note: Vendors are required to make these arrangements only if approved to progress to Phase 
II  Clinical Evaluation Phase and then vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding 
the date of inservice/demonstration with the MTF and final return of the product sample sets.  
2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.
3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one day at the selected sites.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.50 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).
4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Northeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical/patient care setting. 
5.	Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors who bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.  Vendors presence will be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.  
6.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.

Clinical/Performance Standards:  
1.	The CPT identified the standards of care that the Northeast Region medical communities adhere to, specifically related to Automated External Defibrillators (AED), and those will form the basis for specific technical/company and clinical/performance criteria.  The standards are set forth by the following: 

a.  OSHA does not have standards specific to automated external defibrillators (AEDs).   However, exposures to first-aid hazards are addressed in specific standards for the general industry. The following highlights standards, Federal Registers (rules, proposed rules, and notices), directives instructions for compliance officers), and standard interpretations (official letters of interpretation of the standards) related to AEDs. 
i.  Section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act, often referred to as the General Duty Clause, requires 
employers to "furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment 
which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or 
serious physical harm to his employees." 
ii.  Section 5(a)(2) requires employers to "comply with occupational safety and health 
standards promulgated under this Act."  Public access defibrillation programs that place 
automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in areas where cardiac arrests may occur can 
reduce the response time up to three to five minutes. 
iii.  Working Against Time. American Heart Association (AHA), (2003), 504 KB PDF 
summarizes the importance of AEDs and training in saving lives, as well as an overview 
of the steps necessary to implement an AED program. 
iv.  The Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association, with numerous scientific studies conducted 
during the past two decades,  has proven that rapid defibrillation is the single most 
important factor affecting survival from sudden cardiac arrest in adults. This research, 
coupled with important technological advances, has  driven an international movement to 
increase access to early defibrillation.
	v.  2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and 
	Emergency Cardiovascular Care Part 5: Electrical Therapies (Circulation. 2005;112:IV-
	35  IV-46.).
1.  To treat VF SCA, rescuers must be able to rapidly integrate CPR with use of the  AED. To give the victim the best chance of survival, 3 actions must occur within the first moments of a cardiac arrest: (1) activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system or emergency medical response system, (2) provision of CPR, and (3) operation of an AED.

    b.  It's a Matter of Time, Would your employees rise to the AED challenge? ShopRite's    
         experience proves they will. Jerry Laws.  Oct 01, 2003. Occupational Health & Safety 
         (OH&S).
i.  OSHA in 2001 estimated as many as 120 workers' lives would be saved each year by placing AEDs in workplaces, especially at sites where workers are involved in shift work, hold high-stress jobs, or are exposed to certain chemicals or electrical hazards. These workers face a higher risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest, according to the agency.              ii.  About 240,000 people in the United States die of sudden cardiac arrest per year, although as many as 90 percent could be saved if defibrillators reached them in time. Each minute that passes before defibrillation decreases an SCA victim's chance for survival by about 10 percent. Few attempts are successful after 10 minutes.                                iii.  With liability and cost barriers to AED deployment disappearing, the time factor--how many minutes it takes EMS responders in any given location to arrive after a 911 call--will cause many more employers to buy them.
        c. Automatic External Defibrillators for Public Access Defibrillation: Recommendations for 
        Specifying and Reporting Arrhythmia Analysis Algorithm Performance, Incorporating New 
        Waveforms, and Enhancing Safety.  A Statement for Health Professionals From the    
        American Heart Association Task Force on Automatic External Defibrillation, 
        Subcommittee on AED Safety and Efficacy.  Richard E. Kerber, MD, Chair; Lance B. 
        Becker, MD; Joseph D. Bourland, EE, PhD; Richard O. Cummins, MD, MPH; Alfred P. 
        Hallstrom, PhD; Mary B. Michos, RN; Graham Nichol, MD; Joseph P. Ornato, MD; 
        William H. Thies, PhD; Roger D. White, MD; Bram D. Zuckerman, MD; Members 
        Endorsed by the Board of Trustees of the American College of Cardiology (Circulation. 
        1997; 95:1677-1682.)
             i.  Safe and effective use of AEDs that are widely available and easily handled by 
nonmedical personnel has the potential to dramatically increase survival from cardiac 
            arrest.

       d.  Ventricular Fibrillation and the Use of Automated External Defibrillators on Children 
       David Markenson, Lee Pyles, Steve Neish and the Committee on Pediatric Emergency 
       Medicine and Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Pediatrics 2007;120;e1368-
       e1379; originally published online Oct 29, 2007; DOI: 10.1542/peds.2007-2679.
  i.  Although the incidence of VF in the pediatric population is low, there is a need for 
 developing strategies to provide early defibrillation to patients younger than 8 years.
  ii.  The most important safety feature of an AED is specificity. As long as there is a
  very high level of assurance that shocks will be advised only for appropriate rhythms 
              in the pediatric population, then the risk of myocardial damage from defibrillation 
              likely is significantly less than the risk of not delivering a shock (probable death). 
              However, the potentially toxic effects of delivering too much energy must be 
              minimized whenever possible.

        e.  Part 5: Electrical Therapies: Automated External Defibrillators, Defibrillation   
        Cardioversion, and Pacing Circulation 2005;112;IV-35-IV-46; originally published online 
        Nov 28, 2005; DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166554
  i.  AEDs have been tested extensively, both in vitro against libraries of recorded cardiac 
  rhythms and clinically in many field trials in adults63,64 and children.65,66 They are 
              extremely accurate in rhythm analysis. Although AEDs are not designed to deliver 
              synchronized shocks (ie, cardioversion for VT with pulses), AEDs will recommend a 
              (nonsynchronized) shock for monomorphic and polymorphic VT if the rate and R-wave 
              morphology exceed preset values.
              ii.  The high first-shock efficacy of newer biphasic defibrillators led to the 
              recommendation of single shocks plus immediate CPR instead of 3-shock sequences 
              that were formerly recommended to treat VF.

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT and lay person validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below:   

1.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care)  The AED is lightweight and portable.
a.  Bystanders require the device be lightweight and portable to accommodate all sizes and health conditions of the people who will be using it.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will lift the device to determine its weight and portability.

2.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) After the AED is turned on, it is easy to use and understand/follow the directions/instructions.
a.  Bystanders require the device to be easily turned on (activated) and guided by the prompts.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will turn the device on and listen for prompts.  The device will require minimal training to use and it will automatically instruct the user on how to proceed.

3.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) The AED utilizes hands free pads that indicate the appropriate placement and are simple to use and understand.
a. Bystanders require the device to simplify the electrode placement during an emergency, preventing confusion and incorrect placement.
b. The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c. Evaluator will take the pads out of the case and be able to place them in the correct positions easily. 
The device will be simple to use and understand.

4.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) The AED uses voice, text, and/or graphic prompts to guide me through the appropriate BLS sequence.
a.  Bystanders require the device to guide them properly through the sequence of actions.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will listen to the device prompts and follow the instructions.   

5.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) The AED monitors my actions and provides me with feedback to ensure I am performing the proper rate and depth of compressions during CPR.
a.  Bystanders require the device to monitor their actions and that the voice prompts will inform them on how well they are performing compressions and if not how to correct their actions.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will perform compressions and follow the voice prompts to the proper way of performing CPR. 

6.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) The AED automatically determines whether defibrillation (unsynchronized shock) is indicated.
a.  Bystanders require the device to determine whether the mannequins condition warrants a shock and if so, that the device will automatically deliver a defibrillation shock.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will listen for prompts from the device.  If the device determines that a shock is warranted, it will use the battery to charge its internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock.

7.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) The AED rapidly delivers a shock if needed with little input from me.
a.  Bystanders require the device to determine whether the mannequins condition warrants a shock and if so, that the device will automatically deliver a defibrillation shock with only minimal input from the operator.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will listen for prompts from the device.  The device will instruct the user to ensure no one is touching the patient and then to press a button to deliver the shock with little input from the user.

8.  (Bystander Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety) The AED continuously records the EKG tracing and CPR event information and that information is easily downloaded or transferred to a work computer.
a.  Bystanders require the device to record continuous ECG and critical resuscitation events with time stamped entries reflecting the rescuer and device activity.
b.  The criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the product on a mannequin at least 2 times.
c.  Evaluator will transfer/download the recorded data to a computer so that the providing facility is able to see the effectiveness of both CPR and defibrillation.

Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Northeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). 

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors who can supply the complete range of clinically-required products, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.   Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.

<p>&#61607; 3,000 pounds live load.</p>
<p>&#61607; Space must not be located in close proximity to high voltage power transmission lines or high capacity radio base stations and antennae.</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Aircraft Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: Purchase of spare major components sets used on the USCG HU-25 aircraft's Main AC Power Generation System upgrade. This system was designed and developed by Dassault Falcon Jet (DFJ) Wilmington and is currently in the process of being installed on thirteen USCG HU-25 Aircraft. It is the USCG's intention to purchase spare major component ship sets to support these thirteen aircraft. A ship set contains Two (2) DC generators P/N A3579-700, Two (2) Adapter Mounting Flanges P/N P612169, Two (2) Generator Control Units P/N R3523-200, and Two (2) Inverters P/N 695-200 (rated at 4 KVA each) all of which the original manufacture is Thales Avionics, Inc. All components should be new with zero time and have FFA form 8130 with traceable to the OEM. Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO). Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center seeks to construct a parking structure which will be located on the northwest corner of the VA Campus at 500 Foothill, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84148.  The structure will replace the existing on-grade visitor/client parking lot. Size of the site is approximately 2 acres or 93,000 sq.ft.  It is anticipated that construction will be completed in the first quarter of 2012.  The new parking structure will add approximately 120 new parking spaces on an upper level supported concrete slab. The upper level of parking will be covered with a roof using steel construction methods.  The on-grade lower level of the parking structure will contain approximately 300 parking spaces.  The project includes 2 elevators and one stairway. The parking structure will utilize 90 degree parking with 24-'0" wide two way traffic aisles, ramping will be internal to the structure within the parking areas.  Concrete spans will be 62'-0" wide, utilizing post-tensioned concrete construction; no other system will be considered.  This project will include a new campus access road from Foothill Boulevard along the west property line south to existing campus roadway systems.

Priority will be on a competitive (1) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business; (2) Veteran Owned Small Business; (3) or 8(a) Set Aside basis.  The Government will use responses to this notice to make the appropriate acquisition decision.The estimated construction range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  NAICS Code 236210 is proposed for this acquisition.   This project will be the first of several subsequent phases in the development of a three level parking structure.  Phase 1 will include footings, foundations, stairways and elevators systems that anticipate and provide for the future construction of the subsequent phases.  Only Phase 1 will be bid and design/constructed at this time.  This project will be delivered using a design -build contracting method.Interested and qualified sources that fall into the above mentioned categories are invited to submit their Capability Statements, no later than April 26, 2010, consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and references that include current point of contact and telephone number.

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a six month sole source extension to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems, Inc. under authority of 40 U.S.C. 121(c), FAR 8.405-6 and DFARS 208.405-70. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Nuclear Planning and Execution Systems (NPES) Operational Support for USSTRATCOM / J865. The primary objective of this NPES support task order is the continued sustainment, requirements determination and processing, analysis, operational testing, and deployment/battle staff support for NPES and the national strategic command and control decision support system. This task order provides Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) to properly support, test, operate, and install all NPES hardware and software. Communication systems have inherent data needs, often require automatic planning support, and must interface to other networked systems, printers, and displays. Contractor support assists with properly developing, implementing, testing, planning, managing, and operating such systems. A Top Secret clearance with eligibility for Special Compartment Information (SCI), Nuclear Command and Control (NC2), and Crypto access is required for contractor personnel involved with operational plans, and with network and emergency actions procedures related to this task.
<p>The follow-on effort's source selection will not be completed by 31 Mar 10, the end date of the current period of performance. Therefore, the Government intends to extend the current task order for six months (1 Apr 10 through 30 Sep 10) to allow time for completion of the follow-on source selection.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide NPES Operational Support services at full performance starting 1 Apr 10 through 30 Sep 10 (6 months), provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer and a copy to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 8 Feb 10.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) Pacific Northwest Regional Office intends to enter into a sole-source contract with Tualatin River Watershed Council (TRWC), 116 NW Lincoln, Hillsboro, OR  97124-3047, telephone 503-846-4810.  The contract will be for habitat enhancement and restoration projects for the Tualatin River Watershed.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 813312, Environmental, Conservation & Wildlife Organizations, and the small business size standard is 7 million.  Reclamation has determined, under the authority of FAR 6.302 and in conjunction with Oregon law, that the Tualatin River Watershed Council is the only reasonable source for satisfying agency requirements.  No other entity would be capable of fulfilling Reclamation's need to responsibly use its Tualatin Fish Mitigation Program (TFMP) funds for habitat restoration activities in the Tualatin basin as issued in the "Final Environmental Assessment and Finding of No significant Impact."  Working with a different entity would be disruptive to ongoing habitat restoration activities in lower Gales Creek, which has the support of local stakeholders; plus the TRWC has created a habitat restoration plan to provide continuity in implementation of future activities, which was prepared with assistance from the stakeholder's group.  The Council was created in 1993 to coordinate resource planning for the Tualatin River Project.  They are an advisory body working closely with stakeholders such as citizens, agriculture, business, industry, environmental, forestry, education, local governments, and water and sewer providers.  Because of these relationships that are already established and the Tualatin River Watershed Council's mission, we believe they are uniquely qualified for this requirement; and we don't believe anyone else could provide these same services at a fair and reasonable price.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, inquiries will be accepted by FAX at 208-378-5108, attention Julie Mathews, PN-3704, or by email to jmathews@usbr.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source award with the Vanderbilt University Department of Chemistry, Nashville, TN to utilize Back-Scattering Interferometry (BSI) in developing new assays that will focus on detecting the presence of sexually transmitted disease (STD) antigens, including point-of-care test that potentially offer an alternative to traditional non-treponemal test (VDRL,RPR) and treponemal test (TP-PA, EIAs, FTA-Abs) and detect specific IgM antibody for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis.
<p>Currently, syphilis diagnosis is most commonly performed by serological tests, which are categorized into two groups: treponemal and non-treponemal tests. These tests have a variety of limitations, including that some of them can only be performed on serum and require quantities greater than 10 microliters.</p>
<p>New technologies are being developed that can be adapted to sexually transmitted disease diagnosis, utilizing a reduced sample quantity as well as expanding the tests to whole blood, thereby mainstreaming the laboratory procedure by eliminating the requirement of venous blood collection. These technologies can be adapted to detect specific antigens and also organism-specific nucleic acid sequences by use of specific non-labeled probes.<br /><br />(BSI) is an advanced optical technique which allows for highly sensitive qualitative and quantitative, label-free detection of molecular interactions in free-solution or on-surface supports. BSI is a new technology which significantly accelerates assay development because it demonstrates zeptomole sensitivity, uses very small sample volumes (&lt; 2 microliters), and requires little apriori knowledge of the molecular interactors.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7210-00-NIB-0176<br />Name: Towel, Highly Absorbent, <br />Synthetic "Shammy"<br />Description: Towel, Highly Absorbent, <br />Synthetic "Shammy", 20x23", yellow, <br />pack of three (3)</p>
<p>NSN: 7210-00-NIB-0177<br />Name: Towel, Highly Absorbent, <br />Synthetic "Shammy"<br />Description: Towel, Highly Absorbent, <br />Synthetic "Shammy", 15x15", assorted<br />colors, pack of five (5)</p>
<p><br />Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service, Office Support Center - Paper Products, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7210-00-NIB-0176<br />Similar Items: 8330-00-255-8282, 8330-00-262-3644, <br />CRD40210, CRD40208, 51149, 574236,<br />CS7324722-WFX7R1, 571261, SHD 220, <br />CRD40211, 100-16, SYNCHAM, <br />FCCC-225, FCCC-360, 331-9206, 22331, <br />85-120</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 2, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.

You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<DESC>Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.
<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Hewlett-Packard (HP) Printers. The specific models of HP Printers that are needed are as follows: Small Black &amp; White (HP P3015dn); Medium Black &amp; White (HP P4015x); Large - Medium Black &amp; White (HP P4515x); Large Black &amp; White (HP 9040dn); Extra Large Black &amp; White (HP 9050dn); Medium Color (HP CP4525dn); Multifunction Printer - Color (Print, Copy, Scan, Fax; Digital Sending Capability; CAC Enabled) - (HP CM 3530fs); Card Reader - USB; Memory for P3015dn, P4015dn, P4515dn - Lifetime 256MB - Memory - 256MB - DDR2; and Memory for 9040dn, 9050dn - Lifetime 256MG - DIMM 100pin - DDR - 266 MHz/PC2100 - Unbuffered - nonECC. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, 23 March 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 39 requires Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6) capable IT equipment. Through experience and testing other brands, HP has demonstrated over the past 13 years to be the only Brand Name that has experienced printer life cycle of 6 or more years. HP has demonstrated the high-speed volume capability and robust life cycle standards required for the heavy use by USAFA customers. Although other printers meet the technical needs of USAFA, only HP has proven to have an extended life cycle. Therefore, HP Printers provide a more cost effective solution for USAFA's printing needs. The Government has been mandated to consider factors that will lead to not only savings, but significant cost savings. Analysis shows a longer life cycle will result in significant savings to the USAFA. An extended life cycle results in better management of USAFA's limited funding resources and equipment allocation.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to IT Accountability, 5136 Community Center Dr East Loading Dock at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the HP Printers may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide an equal product. It is the offerors responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product, and life cycle longevity. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement can be conducted. A determination that equal products exist based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received by 12:00 pm NOON Mountain Time on 21 April 2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC Karen Jackson, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-4060 or sent via e-mail to karen.jackson@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-3961, leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p><br />5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>

<DESC>In the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 training activities may include on-the-job training (OJT) (Sec 134 (d)(4)(D) of WIA.)  A survey by the National Association of Workforce Boards (NAWB) indicated that the paperwork burden to employers was a major barrier to implementing OJT programs at the local level.  

In order to encourage the implementation of OJT to get individuals back to work while receiving valuable training and skill up-grading, the Employment and Training Administration is using  $500,000 in ARRA technical assistance funds to create OJT templates and tools targeted to high growth sectors.  

New York, Missouri, and Oregon have agreed to provide policies, procedures, templates, monitoring documents, and guidance to inform this technical assistance strategy.  The contractor will work closely with ETA staff and state points of contact to ensure that deliverables are in line with expectations of federal staff. 

All documents produced should be concise, comprehensive, and easily transferable to all states regardless of level of expertise.  

All deliverables must be web-based, download-able, and hosted on workforce3one.com

<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>The Office of Regulatory Science, in collaboration with the FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs and the State of North Carolina will be testing a high throughput rapid foodborne bacteria detection and identification system known as the PlexID, which could greatly enhance the FDA's ability to monitor and protect the nations food supply. A hybrid delivery order and task order contract is needed to 1) facilitate the procurement of assay kits for CFSAN and for the collaborating laboratories; 2) facilitate further assay kits development.</p>
<p><br />Draft Scope of Work:</p>
<p>1.) Assay kits for Abbott Molecular/Ibis Biosciences T5000 and PlexID bacterial identification systems. 2) Assays for Abbott Molecular/Ibis Biosciences PlexID bacterial identification system.</p>
<p>Part 1. Delivery of assay kits for IBIS T5000 and IBIS PlexID systems.<br />The contractor will deliver kits compatible for use with the Abbott Molecular/IBIS Biosciences T5000 and PlexID bacterial identification systems. These systems are generally capable of the following and the kits supplied must be compatible with these systems, since they will be operational at CFSAN and in the field. These systems use an integrated sample preparation and measurement approach. They use robotics to extract and isolate DNA from samples, followed by transfer to a PCR thermal cycler to amplify the DNA after introduction of particular, and specifically chosen, primers. Once the amplification has been completed, the sample will be robotically handled and cleaned up, followed by analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry. A mass spectrometry measurement of the PCR amplicons gives a detailed organism fingerprint, which provides much more information than a simple yes/no answer provided by probes in real-time PCR; detection is not limited to previously known organisms. The approach can rapidly identify organisms in a mixture without additional sample preparation steps. By adjusting the primer selection, the method can be made general or specific and can rapidly identify mutations (within the amplified region). The approach can handle many different types of samples including: air, soil, water, mucosal swabs and washes, sterile fluids (blood, CSF, urine), hair, teeth, and bone, making it very amenable to food matrices. The approach is also high throughput, allowing for the analysis of 600-1200 samples per 24 hour period.</p>
<p>Draft requirements<br />1. Kits must be compatible with the Abbott Molecular/IBIS Biosciences T5000 or PlexID system. As such they must be have the following specifications<br />a. T5000 kits<br />i. Must consist of a set of 3 plates, 10 sets per kit, with bar codes that can be registered with the data system and database for the T5000 system. Each plate must be of a 96-well format and must be physically compatible with the sample handling robotics of the T5000 system.<br />ii. Each well of plate 1 of each set must have PCR primers that are specific for that well/sample/amplicon combination, in order to generate a PCR amplicon that can be measured by the mass spectrometer and correlated with an overall fingerprint pattern for that target. Appropriate amplification standards (to measure quantity) and PCR mass calibration standards must also be included in each well and must be compatible with the Abbott Molecular/Ibis Biosciences data analysis and database software. Each plate must be compatible with the Mastercycler thermal cycler or equivalent for PCR amplification.<br />iii. The second plate must consist of a cleanup plate consisting of ion exchange resin on magnetic particles. Each well from plate well is transferred to a corresponding well on plate two and the DNA amplicons from stage 1 are de-salted with the ion exchange resin coated magnetic beads. After cleanup, the beads a re pulled to the bottom of the plate and the solution is transferred to plate 3. Each plate must be completely compatible with the T5000 robotics, and must be capable of preparing the amplified DNA, by thorough de-salting, for measurement by the T5000n mass spectrometer.<br />iv. The third plate must be a 96-well plate compatible with the T5000 robotics, must be capable of receiving the liquid sample of prepared amplicon from the second plate and must be barcoded for proper identification by the T5000 system.<br />v. Each kit must contain appropriate clean-up reagents for each step in the analysis process, and must contain appropriate instrument calibrants where necessary.<br />b. PlexId kits<br />i. Must consist of a set of 2 plates, 10 sets per kit, with bar codes that can be registered with the data system and database for the PlexID system. Each plate must be of a 96-well format and must be physically compatible with the sample handling robotics of the PlexID system<br />ii. Each well of plate 1 of each set must have PCR primers that are specific for that well/sample/amplicon combination, in order to generate a PCR amplicon that can be measured by the mass spectrometer and correlated with an overall fingerprint pattern for that target. Appropriate amplification standards (to measure quantity) and PCR mass calibration standards must also be included in each well and must be compatible with the Abbott Molecular/Ibis Biosciences data analysis and database software. The plate must be of a size and format compatible with a Tecan liquid handling system, a Mastercycler thermal cycler or equivalent for PCR amplification, and must be compatible with the robotics of the PlexID system. .<br />iii. The second plate must be a 96-well plate compatible with the PlexID robotics, must be capable of receiving the liquid sample of prepared amplicon from the first plate (after cleanup by an intermediate stage that intergral to the PlexID robotics and must be barcoded for proper identification by the PlexID system.<br />c. All kits<br />i. Must be barcoded in such a way as to be compatible with the T5000 or PlexID system, respectively. As such, the barcode must specify the assay type and well layout so that the operating system can correlate the results for a particular well with the identification pattern that is part of that assay.<br />ii. Standard assay kits must be available for the T5000 and the PlexID in the following formats:<br />1. Bacterial surveillance (general bacterial surveillance across broad classes)<br />2. High sensitivity bacterial surveillance (detection of and identification of low levels of broad classes of bacteria)<br />3. Detection of vibrio cholerae and vibrio parahaemolyticus<br />4.

Kits must be available in quantities (1-10 kits per order) sufficient to allow for the government to respond to research needs and foodborne outbreaks as methods based on the T5000 or PLexID become standard methods. The ability to order from one location (CFSAN) and drop ship to other locations must be part of the ordering and delivery process.<br />v. Vendor must specify a maximum estimated shipping cost per kit (to CFSAN in College Park, MD, Raleigh, NC or Irvine, CA).</p>
<p>Part 2. Draft Statement of Work for development of custom assays for the T5000 and PlexId systems</p>
<p>Overview: The Office Regulatory Science has recently purchased a three new multiplexed DNA amplification and detection systems for the rapid detection and identification of organisms, particularly bacteria. This system is manufactured by Abbott Molecular and is known as the PlexID system. This system will be used at CFSAN, at the FDA/ORA LosAngeles district lab (Irvine) and in a collaborative effort at the North Carolina State Laboratory. There are many food safety problems, particularly those related to the foodborne illnesses caused by pathogenic bacteria, which require the rapid detection and identification of the microorganism that is responsible for the outbreak. Such identification can be used to determine the course of appropriate treatment, and can be used in tracing back the outbreak to its origin so that the causes can be evaluated and prevented. The PlexID rapid DNA detection and identification system also allows for the identification of changes within an organism and would allow for the identification of the emergence of new strains. Other applications may include the rapid amplification and measurement of DNA for fish species identification and the rapid characterization of allergens in foods using DNA-based identification. The precursor for the PlexID, the T5000, is already being used in bacterial surveillance studies and in microbial ecology studies related to the outbreak of Salmonella in tomatoes.<br />The system uses an integrated sample preparation and measurement approach. It uses specifically chosen PCR primers to amplify DNA targets extracted from samples. Once the amplification has been completed, the sample is robotically handled and cleaned up, followed by analysis using electro-spray mass spectrometry. A mass spectrometry measurement of the PCR amplicons gives a detailed organism fingerprint, which provides much more information than a simple yes/no answer provided by probes in real-time PCR; detection is not limited to previously known organisms. The approach can rapidly identify organisms in a mixture without additional sample preparation steps. By adjusting the primer selection, the method can be made general or specific and can rapidly identify mutations (within the amplified region). The approach can handle many different types of samples including: air, soil, water, mucosal swabs and washes, sterile fluids (blood, CSF, urine), hair, teeth, and bone, making it very amenable to food matrices. The approach is also high throughput, allowing for the analysis of 600-1200 samples per 24 hour period.</p>
<p>General Requirements:<br />Further development of the PlexID system will be required to fully utilize its capabilities for FDA related issues. Foremost among the problems that the PlexID could rapidly address, with additional development, is the problem of foodborne pathogen typing including species identification of Salmonella. Shigella, E. coli, and Listeria. Current beta test plate development is underway and should be completed soon, but future modifications may be necessary as new information becomes available. This is a critical application that would significantly enhance FDA's forensic and investigatory microbiology capability and enable more rapid trace-back when new outbreaks occur. Other problems that will be addressed by the PlexID, but will require further development, include the problem of Salmonella serotyoping, a currently tedious process requiring weeks for completion that is critical for identifying the source of bacterial foodborne outbreaks. Finally, there are new emerging problems, such as the appearance of new strains of E.coli outside the O157:H7 serotype most commonly associated with human illness. New assays will have to be developed to target all enteric disease producing E. coli, not just the O157:H7 group. To do this, the capability is required to develop new assays for the PlexID, followed by beta kit testing and deployment.</p>
<p>Draft Specific Requirements under this Procurement:</p>
<p>A. Initial assay development<br />1. FDA scientists will work with the vendor to assemble information, based on genetic information available from on-line data bases, newly sequenced genomes and other appropriate sources within and outside the public domain, to generate DNA sequences that, if incorporated into the T5000/PlexID analysis scheme, should provide the appropriate level of differentiation and identification necessary for the designated problem. The vendor will use appropriate software tools to determine whether the information available is suitable to proceed with assay development that will fit with the T5000/PlexID approach.<br />2. The vendor will use this genetic information to design primer pairs that will generate PCR amplicons appropriate for the PlexID biosensor. The vendor will then develop a prototype kit suitable for testing as part of the PlexID system. These kits will include the appropriate primer pairs, PCR standards, and mass calibration standards. The vendor will be required to have the capability to modify the database used by the PlexID system in order to be able to use the results from the prototype kit in the initial experimental evaluation phase, which will verify correct identification of the bacteria in question. The vendor will produce enough prototype kits (up to 10) that they can be sufficiently tested in the vendor's laboratories and at CFSAN, in close collaboration with CFSAN scientists.<br />3. The costs for parts 1 and 2 will be combined together when the vendor is making a proposal for the work. Should the initial testing and prototype development not justify further development of beta test kits, then the task can be modified to allow for more prototype development, or a new task can be developed based on new or existing information.<br />4. In some cases, CFSAN may do the assay development and prototype development in its own laboratories. In this case, the vendor will be asked to modify the PlexID database to incorporate the CFSAN-developed assay.</p>
<p>B. Draft Beta test kit development and delivery<br />1. Upon completion of prototype testing, the vendor will generate a specified number of beta test kits for use at CFSAN at a specified price per kit. The beta kits will be based upon the results of the initial assay development/prototype testing. The vendor will be required to develop no fewer than 10 kits to allow for a sufficient production run, and the vendor will agree to supply a sufficient number of kits to allow for thorough testing at CFSAN (up to 30). Should the vendor have no plans to turn the kits into a commercial product, the vendor must be able to continue to supply the same beta kits in future production runs, as designated by future task orders.<br />2. If the vendor so desires, the beta kits can be moved to a standard price list so that they can be obtained through delivery orders, credit card purchases or any other standard procurement process, for use not only be the FSDA/CFSAN, but anyone else the vendor deems appropriate.<br />3. In some cases, CFSAN may do the assay development and prototype development in its own laboratories. In such cases, the vendor may be requested to bid on production of beta test kits based on CFSAN specifications</p>

<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY UNDER THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CONTRACT NUMBER HHSN276200900472U, RFQ No. NLM-09-182-SES.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.7 Publicizing Requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act this is a notification of a modification to an existing, competitively awarded, firm-fixed priced, procurement using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding. The procurement is for hosting, maintenance and support services and was competed and awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules.&nbsp; Competition was limited to business holders under the GSA Schedule 874-4.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to modify task order number HHSN-276-2009-00472U with d'Vinci Interactive, Inc. (DUNS No.933998254). The purpose of the modification is to acquire PDF versions of the current NIH OER "Protecting Human Research Participants" English and Spanish web-based tutorials. The tutorials will enable research teams with limited access to internet connections to download the course and take it off-line. This capability will further expand the number of participants, allowing it to penetrate more remote areas of the world and low-income sectors of the economy. This enables more diverse sectors of the population to meet the NIH requirement for education in the "Protection of Human Participants" and increases the potential for Spanish speakers to be employed by the NIH biomedical research activities funded by ARRA. D'Vinci Interactive has intricate knowledge of the course content, programming, and user needs specific to the tutorials and necessary for the creation of appropriate PDF's. The agency has costs associated with the tutorials' creation, update, and management through d'Vinci Interactive since 2006. The modification is in scope and does not constitute new work.</p>
<p>This notice is for information purposes only. This is not a RFQ nor is a RFQ available.&nbsp; If you have any questions please contact Shari Shor at shorse@mail.nlm.nih.gov.</p>

*****************************************************************************************************************************************
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
BACKGROUND: The Department of the Interior (DOI) and the National Park Service (NPS) require parks to protect and preserve their museum collections in perpetuity. In order to accomplish this task, DOI and NPS policies and standards require that certain planning documents be written to aid the park in the management of the collections.  These documents include Collection Management Plans, Museum Collection Emergency Operations Plans, and Collection Storage Plans.  Care and proper management of AKRO museum collections is not only a priority for the Region but also integral to the mission of the National Park Service. The Museum Emergency Operation Plan is a required document under Directors Order 24 (Museum Collection Management). 
1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Contractor, Cumberland Curatorial is the only consultant with both the needed qualifications for producing these plans and has previously and extensively worked with many of the collections of the region.  
2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: The Alaska Region receives special soft funding that is mandated to be used exclusively for the management of museum collections including the development of required collection management planning documents. The Alaska Region Senior Curator has put considerable effort in arranging for Collection Storage Plans, Museum Collection Emergency Operations Plans and Collection Management Plans to be written for parks in the region. These plans have significantly improved the management of museum collections throughout the Region and have contributed to the protection and preservation of these valuable regional resources.  
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  Cumberland Curatorial is the consultant with most extensive experience in producing these specialized museum plans (116 collectively). The Consultant has done considerable work in the region having produced planning documents for ARCC, GLBA, KLGO, DENA, WRSA, KATM, LACL, ANIA, and SITK.  Since the Consultant has worked at ARCC and other sites within the region, he is knowledgeable with the types of collections to be found in the region. Even within the National Park Service service-wide there are very few permanent staff (probably less than five) that have experience in producing some of these specialized documents (CSPs in particular). The Consultant is familiar with regional office and park curatorial staff.  National Park Service collection management policies and standards are specific to the service and the Consultant has extensive knowledge of those policies and standard s having worked for over 31 years as a museum professional in the NPS and DOI. The Consultant will require no training by ARCC curatorial staff or park personnel.  This unique experience and familiarity of NPS policies and standards will enable Cumberland Curatorial to perform the required work in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. 
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  This is a continuing Region-wide project.  Emergency Plans are completed as funds become available.  To date the contractor has completed EOPs for KEFJ, SITK, ARCC, BELA, DENA, NOAT, KOVA, CAKR, NOAT, KATM, ANIA, LACL, ALAG. 
5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The Consultant's past performance has been impressive and is of a highly professional quality. Cumberland Curatorial has an intimate knowledge of collection management standards, practices, techniques, and documents that come only from long-term experience and professional development. In addition, Cumberland Curatorial is familiar with regional safety personnel and emergency operations for Alaska since he produced the Museum Emergency Operation Plan for all park units housing collections at the Alaska Regional Curatorial Center (ARCC) in Anchorage, AK (currently nine units). The current proposed action is very much a follow-on to the work previously performed for the Alaska Region by the proposed Consultant.  The newly desired work would be consistent and uniform with previously submitted MCEO Plans devised for other park units.
6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  None.

<DESC>The services required are high-throughput whole mate paired genome paired end sequencing (WGS), through the University of Minnesota Mayo Core Genomics Facility via Illumina WGS using Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. The Mayo Genomics Core will generate 10 genomic libraries and 20 transcriptome (RNA-sequence) libraries and sequence each library to a depth of at least five million reads for $39,000.00. The University of Minnesota will also provide bioinforrnatics support for analyzing the generated sequences. This sequencing addresses mutant lines derived from an NSF funded project designed to produce 15,000 mutant lines of soybean and the soybean transcript data. It is also related to a collaboration between USDA-ARS Plant Science Research Unit (PSRU) St. Paul, MN and the University of Minnesota Agronomy and Plant Genetics Department to define introgressed regions and deletion mutants in the soybean genome. Previous collaboration between University of Minnesota and the PRSU have defined introgressed regions in the soybean genome for QTLs related to protein and iron chlorosis. The sole source sequencing and bioinformatics described above will build upon previous sequencing done by the PSRU and will allow access to local bioinformatic resources. <br />Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Johnson Controls, Inc. without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<DESC><p align="left">Preamble<br /><br />Analysis of&nbsp;perfluorocarbon tracer compounds (PFTs)&nbsp;in air samples is currently performed by the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Tracer Technology Group using a specially modified commercial gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (ECD). There are many compounds in environmental samples that are present at higher concentrations than the PFTs and thus interfere with their detection. Such compounds include SF6, nitrogen oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The uniquely designed sampling and analytical process currently used by the BNL Tracer Technology Group includes methods to eliminate these compounds from the samples. Thus, the BNL analytical method and customized instrumentation currently in use is capable of measuring the atmospheric background of these compounds, i.e., down to&nbsp;the low parts per quadrillion (one part in 1015) levels. The current system is designed to analyze samples collected on Capillary Absorption Tube Samplers (CATS) and Brookhaven&nbsp; Atmospheric Tracer Sampler (BATS).</p>
<p>This requisition is to solicit proposals for the development of a new system that will duplicate or exceed existing&nbsp;performance capabilities and be compatible with the current instruments and&nbsp;include&nbsp;state-of-the-art components, control systems and operation. Specifically, this work will result in the development of a custom gas chromatograph (GC) system built on one of the commercially available PerkirI-Elmer GC platforms with an Electron Capture Detector (ECD) that is compatible with TotalChrom chromatography software currently used by the BNL Tracer Technology Group.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />Alternate I (Oct 2008). When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause. <br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. <br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. <br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] <br />(5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may- <br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or <br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause. <br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. <br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to- <br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or <br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. <br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. <br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. <br />(e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause- <br />(i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. <br />(ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are- <br />(A) Performed by the contractor; <br />(B) Performed by the subcontractors; or <br />(C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. <br />(iii) Materials means- <br />(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; <br />(B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; <br />(C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); <br />(D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and <br />(E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. <br />(iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. <br />(i) Payments. (1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: <br />(i) Hourly rate. <br />(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. <br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. <br />(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. <br />(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. <br />(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. <br />(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. <br />(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. <br />(3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. <br />(ii) Materials. <br />(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the- <br />(1) Quantities being acquired; and <br />(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. <br />(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor- <br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or <br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. <br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall- <br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and <br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. <br />(D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. <br />(1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."] <br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None')."] <br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. <br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. <br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; <br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment- <br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); <br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; <br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and <br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. <br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost- <br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and <br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. <br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall- <br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the- <br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); <br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; <br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and <br />(D) Contractor point of contact. <br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. <br />(6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. <br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. <br />(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if- <br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; <br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or <br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). <br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. <br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: <br />(A) The date fixed under this contract. <br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. <br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on- <br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; <br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or <br />(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. <br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. <br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. <br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. <br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. <br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. <br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. <br />(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. <br />(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. <br />(10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. <br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination.

BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoters quotation against the evaluation criteria described below.  In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.  

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.    

Factor 1  Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements.  Quotation will be evaluated on the quoters ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage services and menu options, lodging, and secured storage.  Quotation must address the quoters ability to comply with the ADA, as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking.  Quotation should reflect the quality of services provided and maintained.  (b) Location.  Quotation will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility with the following U.S. Postal Code areas:  19103, 19106 and 19107, with adequate low cost or free parking for attendees, with multiple local transportation options that are cost effective for the government travelers.  The facility has a variety of restaurants and other attractions within a 10 minute walk of the hotel.  (c) Availability of Dates.  Quoters will be evaluated on the ability to provide the required services on the dates requested.  Site Visits:  The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable.  The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years.  The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of clients program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided.  EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and dcor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc).  In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating. 

Factor 3  Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate.  Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for all breaks and reception, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates.  
	
Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the quoters initial quote should contain the quoters best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52  Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain ServicesCertification, apply to this acquisition.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>AFAFARS 5352.223-9001, Health and Safety on Government Installations<br /><br />88 CONS H-002, Delivery Procedures Commercial Vehicles<br />All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation. Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: <br />1. Step van/panel truck <br />2. Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo<br />3. Tanker trucks <br />4. Box trucks<br />5. Tour buses <br />6. Garbage/recycled waste trucks<br />7. Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks<br />8. Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker <br />This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.<br />The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:<br />1. If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG. To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers' names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base. This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time. If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours. All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector. The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B. If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access. <br />2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base. After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B. The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG. To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery. The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.<br />Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.) Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.</p>

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

All offerors who are considering submitting a proposal for this requirement, the proposal due date is 04/22/2010 by 4:30 p.m. CST 1. Is the contractor able to log into VistaRad remotely and have linked PowerScribe? Yes this is possible but each would be a separate login so you would have an instance of each running on the computer. One would just type in the 'case number' for an examination, in PowerScribe, to access report entry. Speed is questionable here because doing business this way causes our current system, VistA RAD, to send full fidelity images over the internet which is VERY slow. There is the possibility of our 'Routing' cases directly to a machine or as we do now, 'Routing' directly to a server on a distant PACS system. The latter two methods allow us to compress what we send thereby speeding up the transfer process.   2. When you log into VistaRad is it through the terminal server or is there a direct interface\client that can be installed on the remote radiologists system? It would be through a direct interface/client on the remote radiologists' computer. 3. Are you using OE Rescue VPN or One VPN, or some other VPN configuration? We are using OE Rescue when it works and as a backup One VA VPN. 	4. When you migrate to a commercial wide PACS, what vendor are you going to use to provide PACS? iSite\IMPAX, etc. At this time it is unknown. Whoever should win the contract will have to provide a method for accessing diagnostic images from outside Central Texas PACS? 5. Is there an incumbent?  Yes, Heritage Health Solutions, LP.6. Page 25, Section 9, subsection c) states: "Contractor and/or sub-contractor will dictate all reports into the CTVHCS VistA system utilizing the PowerScribe voice recognition system, version, and patch compatible with that of CTVHCS. The Contractor and/or sub-contractor must maintain a compatible version at all times (current version is 4.7, patch 5)." Is the use of PowerScribe required if we are able to transcribe our own reports and submit those reports directly into the CTVHCS VistA system via a HL7 interface? This is possible but we will not support such an interface since we have our own PowerScribe System with furnished licenses for the contractor's use. If this is something that the successful vendor wants to do they would be responsible for 100% of the implementation costs associated with making it work.7. Page 18, Section 1 states:  "Contractor and/or sub-contractor radiologists must communicate a critical imaging result directly to the ordering provider and verify 'read back' of that result by the ordering provider within 60 minutes of its identification." Later in the RFP, Page 22, Section 6, subsection c) states: "The Contractor and/or sub-contractor will interpret and provide a completed exam report into VistA for all exams properly identified and communicated as emergency in nature within two (2) hours of receipt of images. Contractor and/or sub-contractor will communicate all critical imaging test results by a telephone call to the ordering provider. Two Questions: What is the time requirement to call back critical findings? Immediately upon verification of the Critical Test Results, noting to whom you spoke, the time, and that read back was obtained. There is a difference between a Critical Result and a STA case as one can have a STAT case that elicits a normal diagnostic result.Are we required to place a final report in the CTVHCS VistA within either the 60 minute or 2 hour timeframe or can the final report be put into VistA within 24 hours? Yes, you must immediately file your report within Vista.8. Page 21, Section 6, subsection b) states:  "Contractor and/or sub-contractor must use CTVHCS-approved abbreviations for documentation in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) in accordance with the QA and Performance Monitoring Section of this contract."  Will a list of CTVHCS-approved abbreviations be provided upon award? Industry standard abbreviations and those that we will provide you upon award are to be used.9. Page 23, Section 7, subsection 4 states that the following is required for submission with the proposal:   VA Form 10-2850, Application for Physicians, Dentists, Podiatrists, Optometrists and Chiropractors" After reviewing this form online, it appears that it is an application to work at the VA.  Instead of submitting with the proposal, could this form actually be submitted upon award? Yes, these documents must be submitted immediately upon award in order to not delay the credentialing process.10. Looking through the interested vendors list, we noticed there were a few construction companies interested in bidding?  Is this solicitation for teleradiology only? OK and yes, this is a teleradiology only solicitation.11. Could you explain the background check procedure for companies that win the contract? Upon award, contracting will go over the process in detail with the awardee implementation information can be found on page 20 of this solicitation.12. As far as being a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, what % is the government looking for? Meaning full ownership of the company or only a % of the company being owned by a disabled veteran? Refer to FAR Clause 52.212-3 and 52.219-27 for detailed clarification, the percentage states 51%; FAR Clause 52.219-27 beginning on page 40 of the solicitation will further address your concerns.13. Relative to Power Scribe, how are we going to get back into the Power Scribe system for electronic signatures?  Through the PowerScribe system via the One VA VPN and the VA provides the license(s).14. What is the National Performance Measures for Radiology?  VA National Measures equates to the industries standards, nothing additional.15. We have radiologists that have experience working with the VA, is that looked upon as a plus?  Each proposal will be reviewed and evaluated.16. I believe I read correctly in the solicitation that the radiologists can have any state license, not necessarily a TX license for this contract, correct? Yes, that is correct.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION CHANGES THE RESPONSE DATE ONLY. The original notice is repeated below.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Natick, MA is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources capable of rapidly delivering portable solid waste incinerators or other solid waste thermal decomposition systems.  PM FSS is not seeking information on concepts or prototypes still under development, rather, systems that are immediately ready to be deployed to overseas Forward Operating Bases (FOBs).  This market survey is for the Government to assess existing market capability, and responses are voluntary.  This notice is not an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal.  The Army is interested in these systems to reduce the volume of mixed solid wastes at its non-permanent, deployable base camps under field conditions, and to eliminate the safety and health hazards associated with burning solid waste in burn boxes or open pits.  A secondary interest of PM FSS is in immediately available heat recovery (for hot water) or waste to energy capabilities to supplement the incinerator.  Required waste feedstock will be mixtures of organic and inorganic materials such as paper, plastic, glass, food, and metal.  The solid waste will not include medical or hazardous wastes.  In order to accommodate variously-sized and widely dispersed base camps, PM FSS is interested in learning of any immediately available, portable solid waste thermal decomposition systems that have a maximum throughput capacity of either 500 pounds per day, 1500 pounds per day, or 6000 pounds per day.  The system must be able to function with diesel or JP8 fuel, because gaseous and solid fuels are not available in the area of operation.<BR><BR>INFORMATION OF INTEREST:<BR><BR>To support this market survey, PM FSS requests that interested parties provide product literature, system characteristics, test data, and illustrations that provide the following information about their systems:<BR><BR>1.  Throughput capacity (pounds per day).  Capacities should fit into one of the following 3 categories:  200 to 500 lbs/day; 501 to 1500 lbs/day; or 1501 to 6000 lbs/day.<BR>2.  Solid waste weight and volume reduction<BR>3.  Estimated lead time for delivery<BR>4.  Footprint size, cube and weight of the system in both transport and operation modes<BR>5.  Total unobstructed ground space required for the safe set up and operation of the solid waste system within a FOB, to include safe distances from fabric tents and other structures<BR>6.  Pollution controls and regulatory compliance status<BR>7.  Fuel consumption (gallons per day)<BR>8.  Other consumables (e.g., gallons per day of water, chemicals, filters)<BR>9.  Electrical power demand<BR>10. Process by-products and effluents (e.g. ash, water, etc) that require separate disposal<BR>11. Current locations and applications where incinerator is used<BR>12. Material handling equipment requirements<BR>13. Prohibited waste types or sizes<BR>14. Moisture limits of waste<BR>15. Waste pre-processing requirements<BR>16. Waste feed process (batch or continuous)<BR>17. Estimated man-hours and skills required for set up and break down<BR>18. Estimated man-hours and skills required to support daily operations and maintenance<BR>19. Shipping configuration (e.g., pallets, skids, ISO containers)<BR>20. Unit price, assuming an order of 50 systems of a particular size<BR>21. Estimated per unit delivery price to CONUS locations on the East Coast<BR>22. Additional capabilities such as energy recovery and waste to energy<BR><BR>RESPONSE ADDRESS:<BR><BR>For those interested in submitting a response, the information is requested by 30 April 2010.  Responses to this notice shall be emailed to Jeff Wallace, PM FSS, (jeff.wallace@us.army.mil).  Files too large to email may be submitted on CD to the following address:<BR><BR>US Army Soldier Systems Center<BR>ATTN:  SAFE-CSS-FP-F (Jeff Wallace/Building 16)<BR>20 Kansas Street<BR>Natick, MA 01760

<p>A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 awards (acquisition and assistance). The staff manages a program that addresses six program areas principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (EG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of developing its new whole-of government strategy for each country and the region for 2011-2016 that will create greater focus of our development efforts and require significant restructuring of our implementation portfolio.</p>

<AWARDEE>CSI GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, INC.;670 N COMMERCIAL ST;MANCHESTER;NH;031011133
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 202.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a distributed antenna system (DAS) to be provided and installed by CSI Government Solutions Inc.3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  VISN 20 requires a Contractor to provide shop drawings, equipment, and installation service for a DAS in Building 100 floors B2 through floor 4.  The work will be located at the Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC) in Portland, Oregon. The DAS shall be capable of coexisting with and accommodating multiple service providers, radio systems, paging systems and wifi transmission.The PVAMC recently issued an RFP under solicitation VA-260-09-RA-0532 for base bid with 6 alternate bid items.  The PVAMC awarded alternate 6 to CSI Government Solutions Inc an SDVOSB concern.  We have since come up with the additional funding to complete the rest of the project and we want to issue a sole source contract to CSI Government Solutions Inc.  Through negotiations they have agreed to give us a price for the difference between the base bid amount and alternate 6 bid amount.4.	Statutory Authority:  	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 		Agency Requirements;	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,		 or Expert Services;	(  )  (4) International Agreement	(X)  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;	(  )  (6) National Security; or	(  )  (7) Public Interest5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  Authority found under VA Acquisition Circular 2008-01, 819.7007 Sole Source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.(a) A contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on asole source basis provided:(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options)will not exceed $5 million;(2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5;(3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsiblecontractor with respect to performance; and(4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.(b) The contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole sourceaward is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting"	Award is estimated at $600,000.00 which is under $5,000,000.00"	This action has been posted in accordance with FAR part 5"	The SDVOSB contractor has been determined to be responsible"	The price is fair and reasonable based on pricing received from previous solicitations"	The contracting officer has determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to award a sole source contract to CSI Government Solutions Inc.  A contract award to CSI for the remaining installation of the DAS system in building 100 will insure that the DAS system gives continuity of service and it will lower maintenance cost.  6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Future actions to install DAS systems will be offered as SDVOSB set-asides.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  Price compares with pricing received under solicitation VA-260-09-RA-0532 for Project 648-09-124 Install Distributed Antenna Building 100 Phase I, it is therefore considered the price that we have received is both fair and reasonable.  8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  Solicitation VA-260-09-RA-0532 was recently issued, response received established that there are more than two SDVOSB that can provide DAS systems. 9.	Other Considerations:  N/A10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A, a sources sought will not be conducted because solicitation VA-260-09-RA-0532 was recently issued from which four offers were received.11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: The PVAMC wants to award contracts to install DAS systems to one contractor per building to maintain continuity of services for that given building.  To accomplish this, the PVAMC will endeavor to acquire funds for whole building projects at one given time.  12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSCENTRALIZED ACQUISITION SERVICES - VISN 6JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 6.302-1 AND 41 USC 253(C)(1)1. CONTRACTING AGENCY: The purpose of this memorandum of record is to document the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), VA Medical Center, 508 Fulton Street, Durham, NC, 27701 (Durham VAMC). 2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: Sole source award to Duke University Health System (DUHS) Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory.3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The Contractor shall provide genomic testing and risk assessment for veterans at risk for Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) for the Durham Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D) Center of Excellence (CoE) in Primary Care.  Specific services include developing an accurate, reliable genomic testing for risk of T2DM comprised of sample preparation, transport, DNA extraction, genotyping of markers in KNCJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2 genes, and results reporting; single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotyping for KCNJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2; and temporarily storing samples until all baseline interviews have been completed.  4. PRICING:  The total procurement amount is $51,800.00.5. AUTHORITYCITED: The statutory authority that permits other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (1), and FAR 6.302(1), in that the supplies and services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source.6. REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: Two distinct research competencies are required of the Contractor: (1) access to a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologist (CAP)-certified, high-complexity clinical laboratory which can develop a genomic test for Type 2 diabetes risk that uses the following genes: KNCJ111, PPARG, and TCF7L2; (2) a demonstrated level of expertise and qualifications sufficient to perform clinical and genetic risk assessment analyses for T2DM. For logistical efficiency, to avoid the exposure of Durham VAMC patients to representatives of multiple Contractors, and to limit outside access to personal patient information, one (1) Contractor with both competencies described above is required.  It is critical that the Contractor have relevant and recent experience with performing laboratory tests for the Durham VAMC, thereby demonstrating awareness of VAMC regulations and the ability to protect the confidentiality of veterans data.  Over the past 2 years, the VA has enacted increasingly stringent protocols, policies, directives, and operating procedures for conducting human subject research, especially with regard to access to patient identifiers and personal health information, and with maintaining security of patient data.  The Contractor must be up-to-date on VA patient privacy and data security requirements. Recent (< 2 years) laboratory testing experience at the Durham VAMC is specifically requested to assure that the Contractor is familiar with how recent changes in VA requirements are operationalized at this facility.  Because of the nature of the collaboration, close geographic proximity (< 10 miles) between the Durham VAMC and Contractor is also required. Specifically, there may be a need for the Durham VA to view the Contractors laboratory techniques and protocols first-hand on-site.  Proximity will also allow for frequent interaction with the Durham HSR&D CoE Staff and direct supervision of contract-related activities, efficient and effective oversight, monitoring, and close management.  This proximity will also minimize direct travel costs to the VA. A needs analysis was conducted and HSR&D has determined that it is more cost effective to contract with DUHS Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory for these services versus hiring additional VA staff, and purchasing the equipment/space necessary to perform the testing.   Further research revealed that the Contractor has impressive qualifications which uniquely qualify them for the requested services.  DUHS Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratorys advantages for the timely, efficient, and effective completion of this project include:a. The proposal submitted to and funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs included the DUHS Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory as the specified vendor for the requested services.b. The DUHS Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory is a College of American Pathologist (CAP)-accredited, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary laboratory that is dedicated to providing patients and physicians with comprehensive and accurate molecular testing.  The laboratory performs all of the high-complexity DNA and RNA testing for the Duke University Health System.  In 2009, approximately 17,000 tests were performed from a test menu of 35 assays.c. This laboratory currently conducts specialized clinical, including genetic, testing for patients at the Durham VAMC.d. The DUHS Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory is the only laboratory nationwide with validated assays to genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms in all three diabetes-related genes being studied in this proposal (KCNJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2).  Currently, no other academic clinical laboratory was conducting genotyping on the TCF7L2 gene.  Genotyping of the PPARG gene related to diabetes is only conducted at the Center of Nephrology and Metabolic Disorders in Weisswasser, Germany.  KCNJ11 genotyping in a clinical laboratory setting can be done throughout Europe, at the University of Chicago, or at Seattles Childrens Hospital.  In addition to the close proximity of the DUHS Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory to the Durham VAMC there is an established courier system that will enable operational efficiencies and effectiveness. 7. FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  Price reasonableness is determined by what was included as part of the research protocol that was reviewed by scientific experts and deemed fair and reasonable for these type of scientific/research expert services as approved for funding by VA Office of Research and Development (ORD), Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D).  All research protocols and budgets are peer-reviewed by other scientists and administrators as part of the merit review and funding process.  8. MARKET SURVEY/RESEARCH: Market research was conducted using Google to locate vendors meeting the following criteria:  * Geographic proximity;* Recent experience performing laboratory tests for clinical or research purposes for VA Medical Centers; * Demonstrated expertise and qualifications sufficient to perform clinical and genetic risk assessment analyses for T2Dm;* Access to a CLIA- and CAP-certified, high-complexity clinical laboratory  capable of developing a genomic test for Type 2 diabetes risk using the following genes: KNCJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2;* Demonstrated preparedness to immediately execute the contract with minimal modifications.Google search returned 50 results that were examined individually for relevance to the requested services.  Google ranks the results by decreasing relevance and after a review of 50 was unproductive, the review ended.  No viable contractors besides the Duke University Health System (DUHS) Clinical Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory were found. 9. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  A market survey was completed for the various laboratories within a ten (10) 10 mile radius to the Durham VAMC in order to see if any met the requisite qualifications.  Additionally, qualifications were limited in a manner that would meet the VAs research needs and provide more laboratories with an opportunity to bid on the contract.  The VA found that the number of laboratories that provide these services is severely limited in this region and worldwide.   10. BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:  It is expensive and time consuming to run a lab that offers all of the genetic testing required for this requirement and it is common for laboratories that offer genetic testing to specialize in such a way that there is not a lot of overlap in services regionally.  As genetic testing becomes more prevalent in the field of medicine and health research, the VA anticipates more labs will become CLIA and CAP certified laboratories and will develop capabilities beyond those they currently utilized.  11. INTERESTED SOURCES:  No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition in writing.12. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION:  This Contracting Officer certifies that this justification is accurate and complete to this best of my knowledge and belief.Marsha K.

The Fargo VA Contracting Office is proposing a sole source to a Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Dakota Latitudes LLC of Fargo, ND.History of this Requirement: None3.	Description of Supplies or ServicesThe Fargo VAMC requires the construction of a new hazardous materials storage building.  The project has a government estimate of $80,854.07 and the estimated performance period of 45 days.4.	Identification of Statutory AuthorityFAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute. This requirement is being set aside under Public Law (PL) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which is codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128 and, specifically, VAAR 819.7007  (Dec 2009) which allows for a sole source acquisition to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  As delineated in the VAAR 819.7007 and pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source awards) for contracts to SDVOSBs and [Veteran-Owned Small Businesses] VOSBs where the anticipated award price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Procedures threshold but not to exceed $5,000,000.  Each related award must be made to a responsible SDVOSB or VOSB at a fair and reasonable price as determined by the contracting officer.  Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written justifications and approvals in accordance with FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute. Synopsis will be posted in accordance VAAR 819.7007 .5.	Demonstration of contractors unique qualifications or nature of acquisition requires use of the authority citedThe Fargo VAMC normally solicits all construction requirements competitively through SDVOSB set asides.  In this instance the Fargo VA Medical Center has located a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business with the qualifications and responsibility to take on this project. The complexity is of a level that makes this project a good fit for this contractor.6.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable CostsThe Government has developed a detailed Independent Government Estimate.  This will be utilized during negotiations to establish fair and reasonable pricing.7.	Efforts to Obtain CompetitionNone8.	Description of Market ResearchDakota Latitudes LLC  Inc has a history of providing outstanding construction service to the Fargo VAMC and was selected for this requirement as they have the ability to complete the construction of the contract satisfactorily and on time.9.	Other Supporting FactsDakota Latitudes LLC  has proven by other similar level contracts that they have the personnel and ability to complete this contract to Governments satisfaction..10.	Interested SourcesN/A11.	Statement of Action for Barriers to Competition None12.	Contracting & Technical Personnel CertificationI certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Therefore, I approve this procurement under other than full and open competition bases.Prepared by://Signed//_______________________CHARLES W.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	 Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:  a.	 Agency: Dept of Veteran's AffairsEmployee Education Services (EES)POC:  Cindy Showers, Program Contracts Manager#1 Jefferson Barracks, Bldg 2St Louis, MO 63125b.	 Contracting Activity:  Dept Of Veteran's AffairsEmployee Education System (EES)POC:  Derrick Harris, Contracting Officer#1 Jefferson Barracks, Bldg 2St Louis, MO 63125St Louis, MO 63125(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Office of Employee Education Systems (EES) requests authority for a sole source purchase order for support services to the contracting office for 12 months, with an option to extend for 12 months.  (3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).  During FY09, the office of the contracting lost two experienced contract specialists.  Three months later, our only procurement clerk retired.  This left the staff with only three contract specialists, and the work of six specialists, where the staff was already in a deficit.  In addition, the workload complexity and number increased, without relief from the existing workload.  With both EES and acquisitions in organizational transition, funding for staff has been in limbo.  With a daunting end of year surge inevitable and no guarantee of additional staff, we are requesting the assistance of contractor support to meet our mission.  The period of performance is 12 months, with an option to extend for an additional 12 months.  The estimated value of the award is $(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  In accordance with FAR 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Urgent and Compelling Need.  At this time, Judy Fischer, independent contractor, meets this need.(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  Judy Fischer is a prior employee of EES Acquisitions.  With over 25 years in the field and 10 years with EES Acquisitions, Ms. Fischer is the only source that is local and cost efficient.  She retired only three months ago and would experience no learning curve.  She knows EES systems, finance systems, VA and Federal procurement regulations.  Her position is only valid until we can fill the 70% deficiency rate within the organization.  Currently, the reorganization of Acquisitions into a centralized career field has put filling these positions "on hold".  With an end of year surge on our horizon, we need to be able to staff capable, experienced people to assist us in completing our mission.  Ms. Fischer fills that need for us.(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.In accordance with FAR 5.2.2(a)(2), this is a simplified acquisition and delay would result in significant mission impact.  Currently, we are "borrowing' assistance from finance.  The person assisting us now has been inundated with her own workload, and we cannot wait for the reorganization and recruitment process to whet itself out before finding assistance.  Already down by 70% FTE, we need to be able to offer a solution to quickly fill our manpower deficit and have someone assist us in processing essential mission requirements.(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.The price will be compared among similar types of services offered by GSA schedule contractors.  These prices are already determined to be fair and reasonable.  It is determined the price offered is the same offered under to most preferred commercial customers and is therefore fair and reasonable.(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.Market research was not conducted at this time.  The criticality of meeting our mission needs overrides the ability to conduct the type of market research necessary to acquire this service.  This award was chosen to meet the immediate, impending need of acquisitions during an urgent, mission critical time.   Future requirements will continue to be reviewed to meet similar requirements and determine if other organizations develop offering similar services.(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:N/A(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.N/A(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.It is anticipated that the restriction of reorganization will be relieved within 8-10 months and new full time equivalents will be in place and hired.  The overlap will be necessary only to ensure adequate training needs and the recruitment of full time staff.  Future acquisitions are not anticipated.  12.  Requirements Certification:  I, Cindy M. Showers, certify supporting data is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition).  I further certify the data included herein is complete and accurate.______________________            _____________________                  ____________Cindy M.
