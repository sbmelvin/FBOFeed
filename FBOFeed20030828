<DESC>The Air Force intends to negotiate with Aurora Military Housing, LLC, on a sole source basis for the privatization of an additional 1194 units of military family housing at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but instead will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from individual military service members monthly basic allowance for housing payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct, maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.  Estimated Transaction Closing: 30 June 2004.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with Aurora Military Housing, LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of 828 residential units at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. NO DATA/DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be 20 Dec 03.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has concluded that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are uniquely available from only one source, because only the current privatization developer is able to satisfy the agencys needs. An attempt to compete this requirement would result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition, and unacceptable schedule delays, exacerbated by the short Alaska construction season, in eliminating substandard housing.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a request for competitive proposals. Developers interested in providing an offer, must be able to demonstrate in writing, by 7 Nov 03, their capability to privatize the required units despite lack of priority referrals and despite lack of a waterfall permitting filling vacancies in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the agency. The agency will not pay for any information received. A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted at address: www.eypsc.com on or about 20 Dec 03.    It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described real estate transaction contact with the incumbent developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any submissions, is the Original Point of Contact listed below.

Responses to this announcement will be accepted from all responsible firms, regardless of business size.  However, eligibility for the first award will be based on the cascading order of precedence as described below.  The second award will be made on an u nrestricted basis.  The cascading order of precedence for the first contract is:  1st  consideration:  8(a) Program; 2nd  consideration:  Small Business Set-Aside; and 3rd  consideration:  Full and Open Competition.  The Government will use the following m ethodology to establish eligibility for contract award using the cascading order of precedence: In addition to the other information required to be submitted, each firm responding to this announcement must indicate their size status under the specified NAICS code and must also state if they are currently certified as an 8(a) small business concern. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the Government will presume that all 8(a) small business concerns desire to compete for an award under the 8(a) Program.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, the Government will also presume that all small business c oncerns, including certified 8(a) small business concerns, desire to compete for an award under the Small Business Set-Aside.  Small busines s concerns receiving an award under either the 8(a) Program or a Small Business Set-aside will be subject to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Initially the Government will only evaluate the qualifications of the A-E firms which have stated th at they are competing for the award under the authority of the 8(a) Program. The first of two awards resulting from this announcement will be made on a competitive basis to an eligible 8(a) business concern, provided that a minimum of three of the competing 8(a) A-E firms are determined to be highly qualified (e.g., are short-liste d) and that the Government is able to negotiate a fair market price with one of the short-listed firms. If responses are not received from at least three eligible 8(a) firms that are considered by the Government to be highly qualified for this procurement, or if the Government is not able to successfully negotiate a fair market price with one of the highly q ualified 8(a) firms, then this procurement will be automatically withdrawn from the 8(a) Program and the acquisition will be conducted as a Small Business Set-Aside.  At this point the Government will only evaluate the responses received from all eligible small business concerns, to include 8(a) and HUBZone small business concerns.  Award will be made to a responsible small business A-E concern, provided that a minimum of three small businesses are determined to be highly qualified (e.g. short-listed) and t he Government is able to negotiate a fair market price with one of the short-listed firms. If responses are not received from at least three eligible small business firms that are considered by the Government to be highly qualified (e.g., short-listed) for this procurement, or if the Government is not able to successfully negotiate a fair market  price with one of the highly qualified small business firms, then the small business set-aside will be automatically cancelled and the procurement will be conducted on an unrestricted basis, e.g., the award will be made on the basis of full and open compe tition from all responsible competing business concerns. As stated above, the Government is contemplating award of two contracts.  The second award will be made on an unrestricted basis.  All respondents, unless requested otherwise in the proposal, will be considered for the unrestricted award.  The same contrac tor will not be awarded both contracts.  Contracts awarded from this solicitation must be awarded no later than one year from the date that the responses to this synopsis are due.  The first contract is anticipated to be awarded in November 2003. With the award of more than one contract as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows:  (1) all awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award i n excess of $2,500.  (2) in making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer may consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firms strengths and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order.  Price will not be a factor in the selection.  Details of the selection process will be inclu ded in the resultant contracts. The contract awarded under the 8(a) Program will be for a one-year period, not-to-exceed $1,000,000 for the base year, and four 1-year option periods, not-to-exceed $1,000,000.  The contract awarded on an unrestricted basis, if to other than a small busine ss, will be for a one-year period, not-to-exceed $1,000,000 for the base year, and two one-year option periods, not-to-exceed $1,000,000 each.  If the contract awarded on the unrestricted basis is awarded to a small business, (including HUBZone and SDB), t he contract will be for a one-year period, not -to-exceed $1,000,000 for the base year, and four 1-year option periods, not-to-exceed $1,000,000.  Each task order will be for an amount not-to-exceed $1,000,000.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the  Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the ne w option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract award.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12 month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period contract amount. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and smal l disadvantaged businesses.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it plans to subcontract.  Sacramento Districts recommended goal for the work intende d to be subcontracted is 57.2% for small business.  The goal further states that of the 57.2% to be subcontracted to small business, 8.9% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 8.1% is for small business/woman owned (subset to smal l business), 3% is for HUBZone Small Business (subset to small business) and 3% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (subset to small business).  Firms should indicate personnel and subcontractors selected to work on the contract, and state  their management structure.  If a large business firm is selected for one of these contracts, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date.  If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rati onale of why the above goals were not met.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 255; however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block 10 of the SF 255.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm or Joint Venture must be regi stered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is DTCG23-03-R-T43014, which is a request for quote (RFQ).  NAICS code is 335129.  Small Business size standard is 500 Employees.  The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  Delivery of the Low Intensity LED Marine Lantern is 90 days after award date.  The U. S. Coast Guard wishes to purchase 375 Low Intensity LED Marine Lanterns; 100 LED Lantern, White; 10 LED Lantern, Yellow; 130 LED Lantern, Red; 135 LED Lantern, Green.  Manufacturers Literature is required for all items.  The U. S. Coast Guard wishes to convert approximately 450 aids to navigation deployed on fixed platforms that use the 12-volt, 0.25-ampere lamp in an omnidirectional lantern.  These lamps are difficult to manufacture, in short supply and require more frequent service visits due to their short life.  There are Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Light Emitting Diode (LED) lanterns that meet the USCGs requirements for this project.  This is not a development contract and only COTS items will be considered.  The requirements are listed below.  Mounting Provisions  The base of the lantern shall have three boltholes, equally spaced on a 200 mm diameter bolt circle.  The bolt holes shall be 16  1 mm in diameter, and may be elongated to form closed, arced slots. Electrical power lead - The lantern shall include a jacketed, one-meter long (minimum) external power lead, suitable for outdoor use.  The power lead shall consist of two 14 AWG (minimum) stranded wire conductors with a minimum insulation rating of 600V.  Color-coding shall be black for positive (+) and white for negative (-).  The cable may be terminated at the lantern with a waterproof connector or waterproof stuffing tube suitable for outdoor use in the marine environment.  Peak intensity - The equivalent peak intensity of the light signal shall be 30 candela or greater omnidirectionally in the focal plane after stabilization when operated at 25 + 5 degrees Centigrade at 30% duty cycle for red, green and yellow lanterns, and 50 candelas for white lanterns. The rated peak intensity shall be determined by the value met or exceeded by 90% of the measured values.  Degradation - The lantern shall be designed to maintain at least 80% of the effective intensity over 6 years of operation when operated at night with a 30% duty cycle.  Uniformity of output - The lantern shall produce an omnidirectional horizontal fan beam.  The peak intensity of the beam, in any direction in the focal plane, shall not vary by more than  20% from the mean (except at lens seams).  Vertical divergence - The lantern shall have a minimum vertical divergence such that the angle between the 50 percent rated peak intensity points above and below the focal plane is not less than + 3 degrees.  Signal colors - The light signal provided by the lantern (separate modules for red, green, white and yellow light signals) shall satisfy the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) chromaticity requirements for the General Regions, in terms of the CIE 1931 Standard Colorimetric System.  Power - The lantern shall operate properly with input voltages between 10.5 and 18 VDC.  The nominal input shall be 12 VDC, as provided by existing U.S. Coast Guard solar-power systems outfitted with lead-acid batteries.  With the LED module energized, the total power requirement of the lantern shall not exceed 4 watts.  When the LED module is commanded off, the total power requirement of the lantern shall not exceed 0.36 watts.  Characteristic control - Each lantern shall be capable of producing the minimum characteristics, outlined below, and shall include control circuitry to permit field selection of any desired characteristic.  The timing of the light signal shall be within 5% of the rated values, for all the environmental conditions outlined in this document.  The controls needed to set or change the characteristic shall be incorporated into the lantern, and shall not require any additional device (handheld remote, computer interface, etc.).  The characteristics which the lantern must be capable of displaying are:

Daylight control: The lantern shall switch on and off at sunset and sunrise, respectively.  At a minimum, the lantern shall switch on whenever the ambient illumination, measured on a horizontal plane, falls below 250  50 lux.  The lantern shall not switch off until the ambient illumination rises above 320  50 lux.  The minimum value of hysteresis for the daylight control shall be 50 lux.  Environment: - The commercial LED lantern shall operate under the following environmental conditions.  a. Exposure to temperatures from -30 to +50 degrees C.  b. Exposure to relative humidity from 0 to 100%, including horizontal driving rain.  c. Exposure to ice loading up to 22 kg per square meter.  d. Exposure to wind speeds up to 140 knots. e. Continuous exposure to salt air and seawater spray.  f. Continuous exposure to ultraviolet light for the duration of the advertised service life of the lantern, as is typically encountered at sea level at 20 North latitude. g. Continuous exposure to the shock and vibration experienced on marine aids-to-navigation mounted on wooden, single-pile structures.  h. The lantern shall not be susceptible to interference from radiating devices normally found in the marine environment.  This includes signals from VHF radio and marine radar.  i. The lantern shall incorporate protection from static discharges and induced, transient voltages on the power leads, as may occur due to nearby lightning strikes.  j. The lantern shall be sufficiently sealed to protect the LEDs from moisture. The lantern shall contain a hydrophobic vent to equalize pressure caused by thermal cycling.  Instruction Manual - Each LED lantern shall be supplied with an instruction manual detailing the installation, operation and maintenance and troubleshooting of the lantern.  Verification - Standard commercial literature shall be included in the bid package to verify compliance with the COTS requirement.  Test documents to show verification of the requirements may be included.  Degradation graphs of the intensity vs. duty cycle are desired.

<DESC>The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircrafts ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industrys initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industrys  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industrys partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an open forum of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of available technology in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industrys understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MSThis request for proposals is part of a Government cost comparison study pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, as implemented by FAR 52.207-2, the OMB A-76 Revised Supplemental Handbook, and Air Force Instruction 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.  This study is conducted to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract (private) or by in-house (public) performance is more economical.  If in-house performance is determined to be more economical, this request for proposals will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  There will be two steps leading to the determination to either award a contract or retain the requirement for in-house performance.  The first step is the selection of the best value contractor?s proposal to compare with the in-house cost estimate.  The second step is the comparison of the best value proposal and in-house cost estimate with a final decision to either award a contract or retain the work for Government performance.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions (Little BOS), in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award (Big BOS).  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. There are four possible award scenarios:  Both Big BOS and Little BOS may go contract, both Big BOS and Little BOS may remain in-house, Big BOS may be contracted out while Little BOS remains in-house, or Big BOS may remain in-house while Little BOS is contracted out.  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 ?14 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 15-17.

Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Accidents

1.0. SCOPE

1.1. Contractor shall serve as the overall production manager and producer of a 25 to 30-minute video to be used for training purposes for the Air Force Survivor Assistance Program.  Commanders and the Family Liaison Officer (FLO) are a critical piece of the program.  This videotape will serve as a realistic training tool for Commanders experiencing a POV death within their unit and for FLOs assigned to assist those families.  The video produced will be based on real life situations dealt with by surviving family members, commanders and FLOs.  It will also be used to raise awareness of the Survivor Assistance program at all levels.

1.2. The Government (HQ AF/ILV) shall serve as the final authority for determining if the final product meets the needs of the Air Force Survivor Assistance Program.

2.0. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:

2.1. Contractor shall provide educational credentials at the Masters Degree level or higher in the mental health area such as: counselor. social worker, psychologist, as well as professional references and successful work experience to the Government or like agencies.  This information must clearly show the Contractor has an understanding of the dynamics and behavioral changes that are experienced by those who suffer the death of a loved one.  Additionally, prior experience with the Air Force Survivor Assistance Program and its various components or equal civilian agencies would be of great benefit to the Government.

2.2. Contractor shall have prior experience in producing training videos to include studio editing and script writing.

2.3.  The contractor shall provide a detailed outline transitioning from the introduction  on loss to the AF through POV fatalities and caring for unit members and families  through experiences of commanders, FLOs and families for approval prior to commencing any contact outside ILVQ.

2.3. Contractor shall provide proof of actual cost of long distance telephone calls for the interviewing of not fewer than four (4) or more than six (6) each commanders, FLOs and family members experiencing a loss.

2.4. Contractor shall produce a video which educates the "lay people" on the dynamics of the loss of a loved one and the diversity of potential reactions.
The Contractor shall cover each of the following areas in the video:
	a.  Introduction to ground safety and POV accident prevention
b.  Experiences of commanders in dealing with POV fatalities and their interaction with unit members and families.
c. Experiences of FLOs in dealing with POV fatalities and their interaction with commanders, unit members and families.
d. Experiences of families in dealing with POV fatalities and their interaction with commanders, unit members and FLOs.
c. Assisting family members in the long term to deal with this loss and to find help
d. Teaching the audience on what and what not to say to surviving family members. To recognize the needs of family members of all ages.
e. That FLOs need to be sensitive to all needs; regardless--for example, it may be more important for the family to have childcare arranged so they can make funeral arrangements rather than have a second meeting with personnel regarding insurance.
f.  FLO assignment is a long-term job.
g. Emphasize the FLO does not become the expert in the various areas he represents, rather is the conduit to the experts ensuring family members receive the best help available from the subject matter professionals.
h.  Conclude the video by tying all areas of emphasis together and a message of importance on situational awareness when driving and Survivor Assistance to the family when a POV related death occurs.

2.5. Contractor shall interview a minimum of four (4) each and a maximum of six (6) each Air Force commanders, FLOs and family members both in pre-interview over the telephone and in front of the camera. The Contractor shall prepare questions related to the list in 2.4. The Government shall review the list for applicability and may provide additional questions.  This information will be incorporated into the video to ensure FLOs understand the critical role they play.

2.6 Contractor will also review AF video footage from previous Survivor Assistance Program videos for applicable insertion into the video.

To be qualified the vendor must have a current MSRA or ABR with the Naval Sea Systems Comand. A solicitation has been released.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA  93042-5001 plans to use a Time and Material, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to procure on an other than full and open competition basis Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) to various fleet and shore activities for the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Command (NATEC) from Lockheed Martin Systems Integration  Owego, 1801 State Route 17C, Owego, NY 13827-3998.  The requirement is for CETS to various fleet and shore activities for NATEC.  This effort includes activities for the purpose of informing, instructing and training Navy Personnel in the installation, operation and maintenance of MH-60S series helicopter navigation, communications, electronic warfare systems; mission equipment; and associated support equipment including:  magnetic anomaly detector set; acoustic antisubmarine warfare equipment; dipping sonar system; sonobuoy receiver sets; spectrum analyzer set; electronic countermeasures equipment; general purpose digital computer hardware and software; tactical computer; magnetic tape memory unit; radar set; infrared imaging system; and armament control indicator set. NATEC requires contractor engineering technical services CETS to provide on-site proficiency training, technical guidance, and information in the evaluation of unusual field problems and render technical guidance related specifically to the equipment cited.  The object of CETS is to elevate the technical skills and abilities of military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system/equipment to the level of self-sufficiency.  The effort will be performed at NATEC facilities in North Island, CA; Norfolk, VA; and Agana, Guam.  The tasks support the organizational level of maintenance.  The OEM, Lockheed Martin Systems Integration  Owego, is the only source with ready access to technical databases of this equipment and is the only source with the technical support personnel capable and familiar with the systems able to perform the services including developing solutions to problems not readily resolved in the field.  The field engineers working for Lockheed Martin Systems  Owego, are the only individuals who have access to current equipment technical data and who are capable of resolving maintenance actions and engineering technical problems for the MH-60S. No other firm possesses the required data and technical representatives with expertise on these systems. The government does not possess the required data, knowledge of equipment modifications, or engineering expertise, which precludes the use of a competitive procurement.  A nine-month base period with one fiscal year option and a final three-month option period are anticipated.  Award of a contract is expected on 1 January 2004 and the contract will continue through 31 December 2005 if all options are exercised.  The contract will include the clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Send responses to: Attn: Nancy Garza, Point Mugu Contracts Department, Code 230000E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 I Avenue, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA  93042-5049.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is for FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710-Chemical Research and Development Laboratories or Services and the small business size standard is $6 million.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00207, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.   A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. This procurement is for Ki Experiments to Improve Training Data Set for Estrogen Receptor  Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) Computer Stimulation Model.  

STATEMENT OF WORK:  A. Background and Purpose- In response to emerging concerns that environmental chemicals may have adverse effects on human health by altering the function of the endocrine system, the Food Quality Protection Act mandated that the U.S. EPA develop and implement an endocrine disruptor screening program (EDSP).  Working toward this goal, the U.S. EPA is currently implementing a proposed EDSP that is designed to detect chemicals that alter the estrogen, androgen, and thyroid systems in human, fish and wildlife (http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/index.htm).   To date, the U.S. EPA has implemented the program on two fronts: (1) the development of the ED Priority Setting Database which will be used to establish priorities for screening compounds; and (2) the prevalidation and validation of the Tier I and Tier II assays that are likely to be included in the final testing battery.   Studies are currently ongoing within the Agency to develop, standardize and validate a number of in vitro and in vivo mammalian and ecotoxicological assays for use in a Tier I Screening Battery (TIS).  Additionally, the Agency has recently completed an extensive evaluation of two Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) computer stimulation models that were designed to detect chemicals that would be likely to bind with the estrogen receptor (ER) based upon the molecular structure of the substance.  Each model was tested for its ability to predict the ER relative binding affinity (RBA)1 for chemicals within a subset of those currently under EPA's purview.  Approximately 300 of these chemicals were chosen for laboratory analyses, and the actual RBAs were then compared to the predicted RBAs.  Results from these tests demonstrated that additional ER binding data were needed to improve the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive probability of these QSAR models.  A problem with the current ER QSAR models is that they were developed using competitive binding data from multiple laboratories, and that some of the data included in the models may not be indicative of a true competitive inhibition (e.g., the chemical may have altered the ER binding by alterative mechanisms).   Thus, to improve the QSAR models, a review of the data is necessary, as well as the refinement of the model by incorporating additional data from a broader group of structurally diverse chemicals.  Since the Agency currently has the competitive binding data for the 300 chemicals used to test the models, these chemicals would be an excellent source of new information.  However, prior to being used in the models, the ER binding characteristics need to be further defined by Ki2 experiments to determine whether or not the chemicals exhibit true competitive inhibition.  Of the 300 chemicals, approximately 10 - 15% exhibited some ability to displace estradiol  from the ER.  By conducting Ki experiments on those chemicals, it can be determined which of these chemicals are actually competitive inhibitors, and more precise estimates of ER binding affinity can be incorporated into the QSAR models.  The purpose of  this  Professional Services Contract is to: (1) conduct competitive binding assays and Ki experiments for approximately 40 - 50 chemicals; (2) to provide accurate Ki and IC503 data for each chemical tested; and to (3) to document which of the chemicals display true competitive inhibition.  Data from these experiments will provide a well-defined data set for incorporation into the QSAR models.  Additionally, these  data be included in the protocol for the in vitro ER binding assay of the Agency's EDSP to document examples of the profile' of ER competitive binding curves that can be obtained from a structurally diverse group of chemicals. NOTES: (1Relative Binding Affinity (RBA)- Calculated as the ratio of concentrations of E2 and competitor required to reduce the specific radioligand binding by 50% (ratio of IC50s); 2Ki- Inhibition constant (Calculated from Ki experiment); 3IC50- Concentration of competitor required to reduce the specific radioligand binding by 50%; 4Kd- Equilibrium dissociation constant of radioligand; 5Bmax- Maximum binding capacity (e.g., total receptor capacity) )

B. Contractor Requirements-The contractor shall conduct the experiments using protocols provided by the EPA.  An example of the competitive binding assay using rat cytosolic ER is available at: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/endodocs/final/erbndbrd/erbndall.pdf (Appendix B5, 1-14).

G.    Equipment- The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment for the project. EPA shall provide the selected chemicals for testing in accordance with "Government Responsibilities" found in paragraph C above.

H.    Security- Although the research to be conducted under this award is not considered to be of a sensitive nature, it is expected that data safeguards will be incorporated under the study design.

I.    Place of Performance- The submitted proposal shall indicate where the studies are to be conducted, and EPA reserves the right to conduct periodic site visits and QA audits at the research organization.

J.     Period of Performance- The period of performance is 15  months from the effective date of the award.

Task I: Determine the variety of test chemicals to be evaluated and the complexity of ER binding data analyses and interpretation.  EPA will provide a set of 10 test chemicals that is expected to exhibit the range of possible outcomes (e.g., chemicals that are true competitive inhibitors of ER binding, chemicals that interfere with the ER binding assay, chemicals that may present solubility issues) two weeks prior to the task.  Required assays and data are:   (A) Competitive binding assays (IC50  estimates) for inert estradiol and 10 test chemicals. (Note: Each assay will included 8 concentrations (in triplicate) of the test chemical  and 6 concentrations (in triplicate) of inert estradiol) .  Three concentrations of each test chemical will be determined from the competitive binding assays for use in  the Ki experiments;    (B) Ki experiments (Ki,  IC50 ) for inert estradiol and 10 test chemicals. (Note: The Ki experiment for each test chemical will consist of 4 sets of saturation assay tubes (in duplicate)). General  methods for these experiments are described in the following references: SC Laws et al., Toxicology, 112:173-182 (1996) and WR Kelce et al., Nature, 375(6532):581-585 (1995); and (C) Data analyses (Scatchard analyses, IC50, Ki).  Analyses and conclusions should also document whether or not each test chemical is a true competitive inhibitor, interferes with the ER binding assay, or if there are most likely solubility problems.  The Final report should include a copy of the actual protocol used (e.g., dilutions of chemicals, etc. ), raw data from each assay, graphs of binding curves/saturation plots, Scatchard analyses, Kd4, Bmax5, IC50, Ki, estimates of intra-assay variation.  Documentation of solubility problems, or any technical issues relevant to protocol standardization for the EDSP should also be included in the final report.  

Task II: Competitive binding assays (IC50 ) and Ki experiments for 10 - 20 chemicals.  Required assays and data are:  Competitive binding assay (IC50 and optimal competitor concentrations for Ki experiment)  and Ki experiment (Ki,  IC50 ) each test chemical. -Data analyses (Scatchard analyses, IC50, Ki) and interpretation of results (e.g., true competitive ER binder, etc.)  The report should include a copy of the actual protocol used (e.g., dilutions of chemicals, etc. ), raw data from assays, graphs of binding curves/saturation plots, Scatchard analyses, Kd, Bmax, IC50, Ki, and estimates of intra-assay variation.

Task III: Competitive binding assays (IC50 ) and Ki experiments for another set of 10 - 20 chemicals.  Required assays and data are:  Competitive binding assay (IC50 and optimal competitor concentrations for Ki experiment)  and Ki experiment (Ki,  IC50 ) each test chemical. Data analyses (Scatchard analyses, IC50, Ki) and interpretation of results (e.g., true competitive ER binder, etc.)  The report should include a copy of the actual protocol used (e.g., dilutions of chemicals, etc. ), raw data from assays, graphs of binding curves/saturation plots, Scatchard analyses, Kd, Bmax, IC50, Ki, and estimates of intra-assay variation.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), plans on entering into a sole source contract with the University of Washington, Department of Biostatistics, Seattle, WA 98195 for Modeling Dissemination of Colorectal Cancer Screening.  The SRAB conducts and supports statistical research, modeling, and collaboration related to the cancer surveillance and cancer control missions of the NCI.  Essential corollaries to the development of cancer surveillance databases and cancer control interventions are the statistical analysis and mathematical modeling that contribute insight into the interpretation of these data.  Research within SRAB is targeted at improving and developing statistical methods and models for use in the analysis and presentation of population-based cancer statistics, as well as the broader areas of cancer surveillance and cancer control research.  SRAB promotes and facilitates the use of these methods and models at NCI, other federal agencies, as well as throughout the extramural research community. SRAB is currently interested in the dissemination of colorectal cancer screening in the U.S. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.  Clinical trials have shown that screening for CRC by fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) can reduce mortality.  The effect of screening as practiced on CRC incidence and mortaility is not known, nor is the relative impact of different cancer prevention interventions that are simultaneously applied in the population.  Microsimulation of screening in populations can answer scientific questions about these complex processes, however, to address screening the SRAB requires accurate information about dissemination of interventions.  This procurement will provide realistic inputs for screening behavior in the United States that can be used in microsimulation models developed by members of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Colorectal Cancer Working group.  The University of Washington, Department of Biostatistics is uniquely qualified to perform the work outlined in this contrct due to their expertise in Bayesian survival analysis, including survival analysis with a surviving fraction, which is crucial in the analysis of time to first screening events.  The University of Washington investigators developed a semiparametric joint model for longitudinal and survival data. The analyses will require combining data from several sources using Bayesian statistical methods.  In addition to methodologic expertise, these researchers have knowledge of and can gain access to various data sources, including national data sources such as the National Health Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, as well as more detailed local data bases such as Group Health Cooperative databases, and the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry.  The University of Washington, is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the required services.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statment and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Statements of capability must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M. EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 15, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement bsed on responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS code 541690

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with Hysitron, Incorporated of Minneapolis, Minnesota on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a single source, for a TriboIndenter Nanomechanical Test System and a 3D Nanomechanical Testing System for High Load Indentation and Scratching on Existing TriboIndenter System.  Hysitron, Incorporated is uniquely qualified to fulfill the requirement for the TriboIndenter Nanomechanical Test System because only Hysitron makes an instrument that combines all of the required functionality in one instrument including the nanoindentation, microindentation, nanoscratch testing and atomic force microscopy all on one test platform.  The use of individual instruments has the very serious drawback that the locations of very small-scale tests on surfaces is lost when moving a specimen from one instrument to another.  In addition, when performing nanoindentation, nanoscratch testing, and atomic force microscopy imaging, the Government does not want to have to move the specimen at all, even within the single test instrument, because the necessary alignment will be lost.  The Government's minimum requirement is a system where all test types can be performed on a specimen without dismounting and moving the specimen.  Only Hysitron offers such an instrument.  Hysitron, Incorporated is also uniquely qualified to fulfill the requirement for a 3D Nanomechanical Testing System for High Load Indentation and Scratching on Existing TriboIndenter System because the system must be compatible with the existing custom-designed TriboIndenter which was manufactured by Hysitron.  The delivery time for the TriboIndenter Nanomechanical Test System is a maximum 90 days after receipt of order, the delivery time for the 3D Nanomechanical Testing System on Existing TriboIndenter System is 8 months after receipt of order and the delivery shall be FOB Destination to Gaithersburg, Maryland for both items.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes by September 3, 2003.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with Fakespace Systems of Rockville, Maryland on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a single source, for an upgrade of an existing Reconfigurable Advanced Visualization Environment (RAVE).  The current RAVE consists of two (2) 8'x8' rear projection display screens in a corner configuration.  This upgrade will add a third projection surface onto the floor area between the two existing screens.  The floor projection will add to the display area providing an improved capability giving the user significantly more immersion into the displayed data.  To achieve the desired upgraded capability, the floor projection must be physically matched to the existing RAVE modules to allow them to operate in tandem and provide an optically continuous display surface.  All of the RAVE module hardware is proprietary to Fakespace Systems.  This equipment will be connected to and driven by an existing SGI (Silicon Graphics, Inc.) high performance graphics system.  The software used for these purposes is dependent on the features of the RAVE, the SGI OpenGL Performer graphics library and the SGI Infinite Reality graphics hardware sub-systems.  Thus, the equipment provided must operate in a turnkey manner and be 100% compatible with both the existing RAVE and the existing SGI system.  Therefore, to be a complete turnkey system Fakespace Systems is the only source to fulfill this requirement since the RAVE module hardware is proprietary to Fakespace.  Connection to the existing SGI hardware and integration with existing video drivers will be provided and installed by Fakespace as a part of the RAVE upgrade to make a complete turnkey system.  The delivery time for this requirement is 60 days after receipt of order and the delivery shall be FOB Destination to Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes by September 3, 2003.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.

<DESC>This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016.  There will be no formal request for proposals or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  It is not anticipated that information other than that provided within this BAA will be disseminated.  This BAA is requesting the submission of proposals for the provision of research and analysis support to the U.S. Joint Forces Command required in the execution of a DoD Directed Training Capabilities Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).    Specifically, this BAA is seeking innovative solutions to accomplish the requirements of three specific analysis areas required in the execution of the Training Capabilities AoA.  The Government intends to award several contracts in the range of $25K to $500K to support the Training Capabilities AoA.  The length of contractor participation will vary by analysis area supported, but will be limited to the AoA study duration which has a deadline of 1 August 2004.  Most of the analysis areas have intermediate termination dates and will vary in length from three to six months.  Due to the business sensitive nature of the program, participants in the AoA will be required to sign non-disclosure and conflict of interest forms.   
The Training Capabilities AoA will result in the identification of cost-effective methods for meeting joint and service training requirements.  The AoA is expected to result in 1) The development of a business case to assess how live, virtual and/or constructive modeling and simulation tools can resolve existing or projected training gaps and deficiencies or enhance training capabilities and 2) baseline todays joint and service training process in terms of cost, capability, and effectiveness and develop alternative solutions for future training requirements.  The Training Capabilities AoA will result in a final report to be completed by 1 August 2004 based upon the following sequence of events: 

	Methodology Report due 1 December 2003,
	Midterm Progress Report due 1 February 2004, 
	Baseline Report due 1 May 2004, Final Brief due 1 June 2004, Final Report due 15 July 2004.
The USJFCOM is seeking innovative solutions to successfully accomplish the requirements of three specific analysis areas of the Joint Training AoA.  Proposed solutions are expected to result in the delivery of a specific product, report, analysis, study result or like tool and/or product that can be used by the government in the preparation of the various parts of the Training Capabilities AoA.   The government will combine the results of many inputs into the final document.  A Senior Steering Group will be responsible for coordinating the roles of subject matter experts to be drawn from various sectors.  The below analysis areas identify the AoA requirements and the issues for which innovative solutions are being sought. 
1.	HOW TO COORDINATE THE ANALYSIS BASELINE FOR JOINT AND SERVICE TRAINING NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A BUSINESS CASE.  An approach is required to identify and analyze training gaps and deficiencies of legacy training capabilities, to include classifying and analyzing opportunities for improving capability or efficiency consistent with Training Transformation goals. 
This area of analysis involves the identification and analysis  of training gaps, deficiencies of legacy training capabilities, and opportunities for improving capability or efficiency consistent with training transformation goals. This will include Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) and other significant Live-Virtual-Constructive service initiatives.  The final report will identify training gaps and provide an analysis of deficiencies, both current and projected.
The deliverables are a presentation and report documenting the baseline case and associated training gaps or deficiencies, both current and projected. 
2.	DEFINITION OF MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS (MOE) AND MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE (MOP).  This area of the analysis involves the definition of MOE and MOP that will capture both the technological suitability and training effectiveness. The Technology MOE will evaluate technical specifications of each alternative to determine the degree to which the alternatives training environment can be integrated with live, virtual, and constructive environments. The training effectiveness MOE will evaluate alternatives against their ability to deliver effective joint and service training. This requirement maybe responded to in two parts, (1) Technology MOE, (2) Training Effectiveness MOE or as a single integrated task including the two elements of the tasks. The MOE task will be delivered in two phases, the proposed MOE solution that will be reviewed, revised and approved by the Senior Steering Group and the actual evaluation of the AoAs using the approved criteria. Although Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) efforts maybe required to validate certain processes, the VV&A effort is not part of this task and should not be in the proposed solution to the problem. The contractor will deliver a proposed MOE solution and upon approval, use the process to conduct the analysis of the alternatives for both technology and effectiveness. The government in the execution of the AoA will use this analysis. The delivery will conform to the schedule provided above. The contractor must demonstrate the ability to generate the response to this task in a timely manner since other elements of the AoA are dependent upon this input. The response should clearly identify the knowledge of what is required and the ability to meet the schedule vice the details associated with day-to-day operations.
3.	COST ANALYSIS.  This AoA area involves the identification of a cost analysis approach that includes all cost and any engineering development effort for each capability or capabilities associated with each alternative. The cost analysis will include research, development, testing, engineering, spiral development cycles and associated cost, procurement cost, fixed cost for facilities, operational cost, per trainee cost, classroom, textbooks, and other associated model and licensee cost. The object is to capture the total cost and compare the results as each alternative is reviewed. The Training Capabilities AoA will provide the total costs for each alternative, using the legacy systems of the Joint Training Confederation as a baseline for cost and effectiveness comparisons. Where a capability to be provided by an alternative has not yet entered a mature stage of developmental engineering, projected developmental cost will be compared with the seven-year operational cost required to provide an equivalent capability by other means. The AoA will also provide an estimate of life-cycle costs over the period 2005-2025 for each alternative. Further, the AoA will provide an assessment of the technical risk associated with each alternative. The cost analysis described above is the deliverable and may be divided into segments if a contractor has significant knowledge and information with respect to a major segment of the effort and desires to deliver a solution for that segment. The decision to divide the effort will be made by the government and governed by value added to the process with respect to quality, cost and schedule. 
Since all work must be measured against a common baseline, the following information is provided concerning the alternatives to be considered during the AoA.  The Training Capabilities AoA will consider a broad range of alternatives, including but not limited to the following:
1. The base case- current live, virtual, and constructive training systems.
2. Common joint tool based on a standard architecture.
3. Separate Joint & Service systems developed independently to a standard architecture. 
4. Privately Funded Initiatives to develop a training solution(s).
5. Use of commercially available products and gaming/simulation technology.
Each alternative will be defined using capabilities that can be measured, such as the ability to stimulate a command and control workstation so the user cannot distinguish model input from live input. Alternatives will then be evaluated using measures of effectiveness (MOE) developed in accordance with the guidelines listed with the MOE requirements. Alternatives may be defined using capabilities found in existing documents, to include operational requirements documents, but only insofar as the capabilities are measurable and capable of being compared against established MOEs.
SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS.  Industry, academia and service laboratories are encouraged to submit proposals that consist of a technical and a cost proposal.  The technical proposal shall consist of a white paper, which is not to exceed five pages, that clearly specifies the proposed solution to complete the task requirements for a specified area of analysis.  The white paper should address how the proposed solution will be accomplished within the timeframes required.  Respondents are encouraged to address any previous experience in implementing the proposed solution.  Respondents may submit a separate white paper for each of the task areas identified above.  
Respondents shall also submit a complete and detailed cost breakdown will all supporting information.  The cost/price proposal shall support the technical proposal.  If the price/cost proposal does not support the technical proposal, the offerors overall proposal rating may be downgraded.  The price/cost proposal shall include all elements of cost and such other cost information as considered appropriate to support the proposal.   
Due to the time sensitive nature of this work, proposals are desired not later than 4:00 P.M. eastern time, 19 September 2003 but will be accepted through 45 days after the publication of this synopsis.  Proposals should be submitted to Guy.Goss@navy.mil.           
EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS.  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this BAA to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposals(s) represent the best value to the Government after evaluation in accordance with the factors in the BAA.  The evaluation of proposals will consider the offerors technical proposal to be more important than cost/price.  After evaluation, offerors will be notified of selectability or non-selectability.  Selectable proposals will be considered for funding.  Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability.  Not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Government.     
Contractors responding must have a background, experience, and understanding of the use of simulation in the context of joint and service training and the implications of interoperability of service simulation models to the role of Joint Operations at an Operational level.  Responses from contractors without the essential skills and experience will not be considered for award. Work will be conducted at various locations, but solutions provided to the study director located in the USJFCOM/JWFC/JTASC building located in Suffolk, VA. A statement of non-disclosure will be required.
Nothing in this announcement should be construed as a commitment by the Government to award any of the project areas identified above.
In addition to new contracts, selectable proposals may be funded through a variety of other mechanisms:  use of existing contracts; cooperative agreements; or an other transaction agreement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Behavioral Research Program (BRP), Health Promotion Research Branch (HPR), plan to procure on a sole source basis with University of California Berkeley, 400 Sproul Hall, Berkely, CA  94720 for the services of Dr. Mark R Wilson to oversee the psychometic analyses to demonstrate the usefulness of IRT to address specific measurement concerns. DCCPS is planning a conference for June 2004 entitled Improving the measurement of health outcomes through the application of Item Response Theory (IRT). The Outcomes Research Branch and the Health Promotion Research Branch are organizing this conference to promote the usefulness of IRT methodologies to these fields and to allow researchers from different fields to interact.  IRT is a family of statistical methods that are used to determine the psychometric properties of measures, and because it can address measurement issues, which are not addressed (or not addressed well) with other procedures (e.g., test equating and computerized adaptive testing), it has a lot to offer to these two fields. Because IRT applications in the Behavioral Sciences are lacking, this procurement will use Behavioral Sciences data to show how IRT methodologies can be applied to better understand the psychometric properties of psychosocial measures.  Dr. Mark Wilson (leading psychometrician) will use ConQuest software to analyze data already collected in Behavioral Sciences to show the usefulness of IRT methodologies and findings from these analyses will be presented at the June 2004 conference. These analyses shall aim to demonstrate the usefulness of IRT to:  1)  Assess the psychometric properties of a multi-dimensional instrument;  2)  Equate multidimensional measures that include a sub-set of common items;  3)  Test equivalence of multidimensional test scores among different groups of examinees; and 4) Link items that have a different stem but common items. This project requires that the leading psychometrician be well-versed in a wide variety of IRT methodologies, including test equating, differential item functioning, multi-dimensional IRT, Rasch and non-Rasch modeling, computerized adaptive testing, and hierarchical IRT analyses. Dr. Wilson played a key role in developing the ConQuest software, which to date is the most comprehensive software that can accommodate the issues generally encountered in the Behavioral Sciences.  In addition, he is an internationally recognized leader in IRT methodologies, especially in its ability to handle multidimensional ordinal data. 
Dr Mark Wilson of the University of California Berkeley is the only source known to the NCI that is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 11, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Surveillance Research Program, Office of the Associate Director plans to procure, on a sole source basis with the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, 3333 West 47th Street, Chicago, IL  60632, services for the data collection and statistical reporting of all primary brain tumors, benign and malignant in the U.S., along with corresponding reporting. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) is a resource for gathering and disseminating current epidemiological data on all primary brain tumors, benign and malignant, for the purposes of accurately describing their incidence and survival patterns, evaluating diagnosis and treatment, facilitating etiologic studies, establishing awareness of the disease, and ultimately for the prevention of all brain tumors. Their first report was issued in 1995 and reported on primary brain tumors diagnosed in 1990-1992 from 10 population-based registries, one of which was the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry in Connecticut. Data for 1992-1997 cases was published in the November 2002 report with rates age-adjusted to both the 1970 and the 2000 population standards. CBTRUS will a) provide ongoing data collection/data analysis activities, and b) perform activities related to the preparation of the 2004 Annual Statistical Report (1997-2001 primary brain tumor diagnoses). CBTRUS is the only entity, which has established and maintained a specialty registry of primary brain and central nervous system tumors, including benign brain tumors, for the United States.  Information on approximately 48,000 cases is included in the database.  CBTRUS plays a critical role in facilitating the interaction among clinicians, especially neuropathologists and epidemiologists, and the surveillance community, which improves the complete and accurate collection of these data. It also facilitates interactions with researchers who need assistance in obtaining important data items that are often missing from their data bases, such as laterality for brain tumors useful in studies of cancer etiology and non-treatment related factors such as location of a tumor by hemisphere which can be predictive for cognitive outcomes. This order provides for the data collection and statistical coverage stated above to allow for the reporting on all primary brain tumors. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service and has comparative registry data and reports as described above it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m., EDT, on September 11, 2003.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The purpose of this amendment is to provide notice of a change to the estimated maximum amount of the acquisition.  The maximum quantity is anticipated to be $600,000,000 as follows:  Functional Area 1(Engineering Services):  $100,000,000 to be shared amon g the multiple contract awardees for Functional Area 1, and Functional Area 2 (Homeland Defense):  $500,000,000, which will be shared among multiple contract awardees for Functional Area 2.  The likelihood of available funding to reach the maximum quantity  is provided for information as follows:  Functional Area 1 - Category A - $2,000,000 per year; $10,000,000 total. This effort is most likely to be funded. It is based on previous and highly probable work to be conducted in the ECBC Engineering Directorate .  Category B - $5,000,000 per year; $25,000,000 total. Funding at this level is possible; and highly dependent on world events.  Category C - $20,000,000 per year; $100,000,000 total. This level of funding is a possibility, but is a low priority and recei pt of funding to support this level of effort is doubtful.  Functional Area 2 - Category A - $10,000,000 per year; $50,000,000 total. This effort is most likely to be funded. It is based on previous and highly probable work to be conducted in the ECBC Engi neering Directorate.  Category B - $50,000,000 per year; $250,000,000 total. Funding at this level is possible; and highly dependent on Chemical Biological Defense Program and Department of Homeland Security reorganizations.  Category C - $100,000,000 per year; $500,000,000 total. This level of funding is a possibility, but is a low probability and receipt of funding to support this level of effort is remote and highly dependent on world events.  A formal amendment will be issued to Solicitation DAAD13-03-R -0003 on or about 28 August 2003 for these changes, and other minor changes, and to extend the closing date for receipt of proposals to 11 September 2003.

If potential contractors submitted proposals for solicitation F10603-03-R-0003 which was cancelled, new and complete proposals must be submitted for this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 314110.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS KEESLER AFB BASE OPERATING SUPPORT (BOS) A-76 COST STUDY, PICK-A-BASE.  The information provided is the planned strategy at this time.  The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under NAICS Code 561210 (Size Standard $23 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MSThis request for proposals is part of a Government cost comparison study pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, as implemented by FAR 52.207-2, the OMB A-76 Revised Supplemental Handbook, and Air Force Instruction 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.  This study is conducted to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract (private) or by in-house (public) performance is more economical.  If in-house performance is determined to be more economical, this request for proposals will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  There will be two steps leading to the determination to either award a contract or retain the requirement for in-house performance.  The first step is the selection of the best value contractor?s proposal to compare with the in-house cost estimate.  The second step is the comparison of the best value proposal and in-house cost estimate with a final decision to either award a contract or retain the work for Government performance.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions (Little BOS), in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award (Big BOS).  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. There are four possible award scenarios:  Both Big BOS and Little BOS may go contract, both Big BOS and Little BOS may remain in-house, Big BOS may be contracted out while Little BOS remains in-house, or Big BOS may remain in-house while Little BOS is contracted out.  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 ?14 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 15-17.

<DESC>Modification #2 changes the release date of RFP N01-CM-47001-28 from 08/29/03 to 09/11/03 as well as the due date for submission of proposals from 10/22/03 to 10/27/03. This modification also clarifies the qualifications for the proposed Principal Investigator.  The Principal Investigator must be trained in organic, medicinal, or radiochemistry at the Ph.D. level from an accredited school and have five or more years of recent experience in radio chemical synthesis.  The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization having capabilities, resources and facilities for the preparation, storage and distribution of radiolabeled materials.  The objective of this project is the synthesis of radiolabeled compounds of high purity in 1 to 50 millicurie quantities.  The synthesis of a wide variety of compounds such as nucleoside, heterocyclic, alkaloids, peptides, natural products, dyes, purine and the like will be requested.  Compounds required may include one or more the following radioactive elements: carbon, tritium, sulphur, phosphorous or iodine.  Materials will be stored and shipped by the Contractor.  The Contractor must provide suitable storage for approximately 250 radiolabeled compounds.  MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA:  The successful Contractor must possess a valid Nuclear Regulatory Commission license (NRC) or a license issued by the State that has entered into an agreement with the NRC (an Agreement State) at the time of proposal submission.  All materials must be completely characterized and assayed as to identity, chemical purity and radio purity.  A well-equipped analysis laboratory including a HPLC dedicated to radiosynthesis work and adequate library facilities should be available.  The Principal Investigator must be trained in organic, medicinal, or radiochemistry at the Ph.D. level from an accredited school and have five or more years of recent experience in radio chemical synthesis.  MANDATORY EXCLUSION:  PHARMACEUTICAL, CHEMICAL, OR BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRMS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS COMPETITION DUE TO THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF THE RADIOLABELED COMPOUNDS.  A pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology company is defined as an organization which sell drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.  It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, incrementally funded, term (level of effort) type contract award will be made for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about June 30, 2004.  To assist in the preparation of a proposal, the Government considers the effort to be 3,410 direct labor hours per year.  This contract is a recompetition of Contract N01-CM-97022 currently being performed by Research Triangle Institute.  The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately September 11, 2003.  The proposals will be due approximately 45 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  RFP N01-CM-47001-28 may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-035-4384-03 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that is in effect through FAC 01-13.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334119.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 1000 employees. USDA, ARS has a requirement for one high-speed camera to aid in the study of dispersal and infection processes of the citrus canker pathogen in south Florida.  A high speed camera is required to freeze in motion airborne water droplets (ca. 1 mm - >5 mm diameter) in wind speeds up to 70-100 mph. It must be a system that is straightforward to operate, dismantle, reassemble and transport between sites.  To ascertain effects of wind driven and rainsplash and spray on dispersal of and infection by the citrus canker pathogen visualization of droplet size and speed is required. The range of windspeeds from still to those experienced in tropical storm/hurricane conditions (40-75+ mph) need to be tested. Thus the camera must be capable of freezing in motion a droplet traveling at at least 75 mph in a wind tunnel facility. Wind speeds in the presence of different types of rain will be applied to plants and tested for their effect on both infection and dispersal of the pathogen. Visualizing the droplets will allow us to relate droplet characteristics (speed and size) in different wind types to subsequent infection. The combinations of rain and wind that causes maximum infection and dispersal will be ascertained, as will those conditions that cause negligible infection or dispersal. The role of water soaking of leaves and the wind speeds associated with this phenomenon will be investigated as a factor facilitating infection. High-speed digital camera specifications and requirements: The digital camera must be sold as a complete working system with software and peripherals and must have the following specifications/capabilities. 1.The camera should have a compact digital camera head and weigh <6 lb, 2. Resolution must be at least 512 x 512 pixels at 1000+ fps, and resolution at higher frame rates (eg. ca. 32000 fps) must be sufficient to allow photo analysis with minimum blur with an ability to image individual splash droplets as small as 0.5 mm - 5 mm in diameter. High resolutions at high frame rates are required to get the most accurate measurements. Higher frame rates give more data points and therefore allow better estimates of droplet velocity. A sufficient number of images must be taken to allow estimation of speed and size of droplets. Appropriate frames per second, shutter speed and resolution must provide this capability. 3. It should have high shutter speeds (<10 microseconds). The shutter speed must be able to freeze splash and spray drops in wind speeds of up to 70-100 mph. 4. Memory time must allow sufficient recording time at high resolution and high shutter speeds. 5. Preferably the camera should be capable of being controlled by a PC computer and as a stand alone unit. 6. Captured images must be able to be downloaded directly from the system in analog form via an NTSC video port, and in digital format via a firewire port. 7. Must be capable of being transported and operated by one person. 8. A C-mount is preferred 9. Must have the ability to mark events within image sequence in real time and be immediately seen and accessible through the software. 10. Ideally should have a dual-speed recording facility to record droplet dispersal at different speeds during the same event.   The software should have the following characteristics: 1. Should be capable of camera control, live image display, and recorded image replay and downloading. 2. Full playback control, including multiple image synchronization, image sequence loop, zoom, contrast and brightness adjustment, gain control, and image pan. 3. Images should be able to be saved, with user selectable compression types and ratios, where applicable, in at least the following image formats JPEG, TIFF and BMP. 4. Preferably once image download is completed, the software should rearm the camera and await the next trigger. 5. Must be possible to automatically track the motion of at least one well-defined splash drop within the image sequence (as small as 0.5 - 5 mm diameter). 6. It should have the capability to track several points manually. 7. Calibration for distance, angle, and origin should be simply entered under this software. 8. Data from tracked (and calibrated) points should be able to be simply exported to Excel. The accessories should include: 1. The camera lens should provide a sufficient field of view (ca. 3 inches by ca. 3 inches) at a suitable working distance (ca. 24 inches). It should be able to record images through the side of (or port in) a plexiglass wind tunnel. The wind tunnel is 100 cm x 100 cm cross section 2. Tripod. 3. Variable friction arm with super clamp. 4. The camera must come inclusive of a light source kit (2 lights, Lowel or equivalent brand) that can be used as back or front-source lighting (should include stand, suitable bulbs, a reflector and IR filters. 5.  The camera should come equipped with a suitable trigger kit. 6.  It will have a hard case to house the camera, a laptop, and all accessories for transport/storage.

Reference No. 03-811-4270


1). There is no mention in the PD as to what the temperature medium is for the bath, air or oil?  If oil, what type do you require?   

Answer:   The temperature medium for the bath is "mineral oil".  NIST shall purchase the oil separately.

2) For line item 0003, was the .0002 accuracy concerning the probe or the readout?  If it is the probe, the only accuracy available in 6" is 0.015.  If this is not acceptable here are a few other size specifications:

4 ":  0.001 accuracy
6":  0.015
9": 0.001, 0.0015, 0.0025

Please let vendor know if any of these are acceptable?

Answer:  The 0.002 deg C accuracy is for the readout.  The PD should have specified the probe accuracy of 0.01 deg C.

<DESC>NA The Directorate of Contracting, Fort Carson, Co is in the process of formulating a Request for Proposals for a follow-on contract for Base Operations and Maintenance Services for the Directorate of Public Works (DPW), Fort Carson, Colorado.  This requireme nt is 100% set aside for small business/HUBZone companies.  The requirement consists of providing management, supervision, labor, property and equipment for the operations, maintenance, and repair of real property, facilities and systems in support of the DPW mission.  Most of the work is located on Fort Carson; however, work may be required at other sites as applicable, such as: Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS), and Pueblo Depot.  Functions in the expiring contract are: Major functional areas: Electrical (Interior and Systems),Heating Plants and Systems, Water Plants and Systems Wastewater Plants, and Systems Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Plants Structural Grounds (Improved), Grounds (Other than Improved)Surfaced Areas, Railroad Facilities  Miscellaneous Functions: Warehouse and Issue Materials & Supplies, Packing & Crating, Signs, Snow Removal, Swimming Pools and Saunas, Grease Traps, Septic Tanks, Hospital Facilities Support, Facilities Support,Fire Detection & Suppression Systems, Fuel Del ivery,	Fuel Lines and Systems,Environmental Services, Special Events, Mowing, Irrigation and sprinkler systems, Support of GIS and Engineering ADPE Functions,Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Act Project Work The proposed new contract will be funded with Operations and Maintenance appropriations and will have a suitable phase-in period, a base year, and, probably, nine option years.  The contract is contemplated to be primarily fixed-price, although there may b e some cost elements. Fort Carson desires to leverage the limited Operations and Maintenance funds we have available by asking industry to help us accomplish our requirements in the most efficient manner practicable.  Thus, the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this contract  will, to the maximum extent possible, be performance-based.  As part of our effort to formulate that PWS, we are soliciting comments or suggestions on the feasibility of our requiring the contractor to do the following: 1.  Provide some or all equipment, vehicles, and property necessary to fulfill the requirement.  Existing Government equipment, vehicles, and property would be made available for the contractors use, but the contractor could choose to provide some or  all of its own.  In any event, the contractor would be responsible for repair and replacement; the Government would not provide new equipment, vehicles, or property.   2.  Construct a maintenance facility on Fort Carson, as necessary, to fulfill the requirement of maintenance of all equipment.  The size of the facility would depend on, among other factors, how much maintenance the contractor would propose to perform itse lf and how much it might have accomplished off-post (e.g., at its own facilities, at subcontractors facilities, or at equipment lessors facilities).  Termination liability coverage will likely not be offered in the contract. Our purpose at this time is just to determine whether industry would be responsive to requirements of this type, and, if so, how we may best frame these requirements.   On September 16, 2003, we will be hosting a conference on this subject that, we hope, will provide you a better understanding of what we are trying to accomplish.  We will provide a rough list of the equipment, vehicles, and property at issue and conduct a  short tour of both the existing maintenance facility and a possible site for a new such facility.  We will also allow time for discussion, questions, and suggestions. If you are interested in attending the conference on September 16, 2003 the deadline for notification to Laura.Haverlock@carson.army.mil is required by September 08, 2003.  Available space is limited therefore each contract or is limited to 2 people to include any subcontractors.   We also encourage your comments and suggestions before that time.  Please send them by e-mail to Laura.Haverlock@carson.army.mil.  The required timeframe for responses, comments, suggestions or questions is September 30, 2003 at 2:00 p.m. mountain time. Th ere should technical exihibits attached to this document. If you are not able to access them contact Laura Haverlock for an electronic copy. See Note 27

<DESC>Environmental Control Unit- The Atmospheric Early Warning system (AEWS) at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC/LHE) is seeking acquisition of Environmental Control Units (ECU). The Government is currently refining an acquisition strategy for ECUs to support remote radar facilities in Alaska, Hawaii, Canada and Puerto Rico. The new family of ECUs have updated performance requirements outlined for the AN/FPS-117 Radar. This AN/FPS specification is used only as a reference for this Sources Sought Synopses (SSS).  The plan is to purchase in fiscal year 2004 approximately 52 identical ECUs. This SSS is for market research purposes only and respondents are reminded a formal solicitation may not necessarily result. Information received as a result of this market survey may be reflected in a formal solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate respondents for any costs incurred in developing information provided to OO-ALC-LHE. Recommend that information be limited to that readily available and that proprietary information not be included. However without written permission from the respondent, OO-ALC-LHE will not release to any firm, agency or individual outside the Government any information marked proprietary Response packages should be delivered in two paper copies, including brochures, software copies (Microsoft Word or Excel) may be delivered along with the paper copies. The response packages are due to Justen Bonham OO-ALC-LHKC   address: 6029 Wardleigh Road, Hill AFB UT 84056-5638 within 30 calendar days of the date this notice appears in the CBD.

General Requirements: The new ECUs will replace existing equipment at remote radar sites. Modifications to existing sheet metal ducting may be required. Repair of wall from any hole created from removal of existing duct shall also be required. Removal of ducting may include potential Hazmat problems such as asbestos in the wall/piping and lead paint. Intake dampers will need to be routed and controlled remotely to both inside and outside of the building/tower as weather dictates. Return air must be modulated to avoid a negative pressure inside the building/tower. Two ECU s will be installed and work in tandem alternating as back-up and have a direct digital control (DDC) panel with remote diagnostic and programming capabilities at each radar site.  Since commercial off-the-shelf equipment is expected to satisfy this requirement, a twelve -month warranty of equipment and installation and support software is required beginning after successful acceptance tests at each site. Contractor will be required to perform site surveys since many sites are unique. Operational manual, drawings and Interface description (ICD) shall be included. Refrigerant used must comply with the environmental laws of the country the ECU is operating in. 

Scope: The microprocessor control system (MCS) shall be fully integrated and installed as a complete package by a single contractor. The contractor shall furnish all materials including all computer hardware and software, operator input/output peripherals, field hardware panels, sensors and field control devices and installed wiring. The contractor shall be responsible for engineering, installation, labor services, system calibration, initial software programming and system checkout as necessary to provide a complete and fully operational MCS as specified herein.

Control power: 120/208 volts, 3 Phase, 4 wire, 60 Hertz. Cannon type connectors shall be used. Control power and signal wiring shall be segregated throughout the installation of this project, and shall be kept at least three feet apart at all times. Under no circumstances shall power and signal wiring be run in the same raceway. Control signal wiring shall be routed clear of all lighting ballasts and other electro-magnetic devices that may damage the integrity of the control signal. Controller should be shielded from possible outside interference.

Specific requirements: Equipment must be capable to withstand cold soak temperatures of 70 F and must be able to maintain 60 degrees Fahrenheit within four hours. Operating temperatures will be from 0F to 120F. Return air dry- bulb temperature shall be 60 F plus or minus 5F at 100F ambient with a total cooling capacity of 60,000 BTUs. Total heating capability shall be at least 15KW.  Due to restricted facility space the ECU must have exhaust, intake and return ports originating from the top and or front of the ECU. All components must be readily accessible from the front of the ECU. ECU must be able to withstand storage altitudes up to 40,000 feet. Operational altitudes are between sea level and 15,000 feet. The DDC system shall be capable of executing the following standard control routines: ECU heating and ECU cooling failure alarms, high and low temperature alarms, maintenance time reminders, trend logs, supply air reset, enthalpy control, remote damper control, economizer or free cooling control, automatic and manual switchover of backup ECUs, fault override capability and remote reset for heat, cooling and fan modes. Sensors will be installed to monitor fault isolation and provide remote diagnostic feedback for the following: high temperature switch, low temperature switch, return air, outside air, supply air, mixed air, damper control, condenser air inlet, evaporator air pressure, differential air pressure for filter, expansion valve, condenser fan, ECU cabinet temperature, room thermostat, humidity control, dry bulb, wet bulb, high head pressure alarm and low suction pressure alarm.

Computer interface: A standard interface protocol shall be used. Transfer Control Protocol Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is preferred for the AN/FPS-117 system. The controller output shall be Category 5 and connect to existing 10 Base T- 10 Base 2 hub /converter in the equipment room. Vendor will need to integrate controller interface protocol with existing proprietary AN/FPS 117radar software.

Expansion: Expansion of the Microprocessor control systems (MCS) shall accommodate additional hardware components to meet future expansion requirements but shall not require special software to achieve this expansion that modifies the operation of the system or its operating systems.

<DESC>A--This is a solicitation for information or planning purposes, in accordance with the FAR Clause 52.215-3 (OCT 1997). The purpose of this announcement is to secure an expression of interest and capability, and also to help the Government formulate an acquisition strategy and budgetary profile for Operational Solar Wind Data.  The Government shall not be committed to paying any preparation costs associated with your response.  All interested and responsible offerors that indicate corporate interest, background and capability in response to this planning solicitation  will be considered for any potential future RFP release. Therefore, only serious Respondents are requested to identify themselves and provide the responses below.  RESPONDENTS ARE REQUESTED TO E-MAIL THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THEIR INTENT TO RESPOND.  OTHER SPECIFIC INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED BY REQUESTING IT FROM THE POC FOR THIS RFI, MR. JAY MOORE, AT JAY.MOORE@NOAA.GOV.  This Request For information (RFI) seeks information on the interest, availability, and potential capability of private industry, academia, and other interested organizations to meet the requirements of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the acquisition of operational solar wind data.  This RFI also requests preliminary budgetary estimates for meeting this potential requirement.  The information being solicited by this RFI is DUE by NO LATER THAN 1300 local time, September 29, 2003.  The Government requests information that will assist it to evaluate: (a) the Respondent's notional technical approach to delivering the Solar Wind Data set forth in the Technical Specifications in the associated specific information obtainable from the Contracting Officer; (b) the Service Requirements for data availability; (c) the Data Timeliness Requirement; (d a brief rationale for the Respondent's estimated schedule, with major milestones; (e) and the Teaming and Business Management Approach, including the estimated Budgetary Costs.  Any research or commercial partners potentially interested in a data sharing opportunity should be identified, if the business approach and costing strategy is dependent upon the same.  The budgetary costs should include, but not necessarily limited themselves to, the following:  the entire end-to-end cost of delivery, including design, development, integration, test, launch, deployment, redundancy and support, operations and maintenance, systems check-out, and delivery of operational data products to the demarcation point.  Innovative solutions, alternative business approaches or cooperative techniques to address the objective are welcome.  These responses will enable the Government to identify from among the industry any principals and teams that have demonstrated the capability to develop the proposed spacecraft and instrumentation, and deliver the data according to the business plan.  These planning information and budgetary costs will be used by NOAA as a basis for a potential future new start.  NOAA will also use the responses to assess the maturity of the existing or proposed designs and models, and to formulate its acquisition strategy.  Through the identification of the responding industry and teams we can realize whether there exists a realistic corporate commitment to organizing a team and a business strategy to meet reasonable technical, cost, schedule, and programmatic goals for the Government. Following the evaluation of your responses we will make a decision on whether or not to prepare a budget request for this program as a new start.  Description: Operational Solar Wind Data:  NOAA requires continuous real time monitoring of the interplanetary medium.  Required measurements include the strength and direction of the interplanetary magnetic field, and characterization of the solar wind.  Measurements characterizing in-situ low energy particle populations are also desirable.  These parameters, when made available in real-time to NOAA=s Space Environment Center (SEC) in Boulder, Colorado, would enable the forecasting and short-term warning of imminent severe geomagnetic storms.  The geomagnetic storm warning would also provide warning of storm intensity based on data from the satellite.  Data must be delivered to the NOAA=s Space Environment Center at Boulder, CO in near-real time.   NOAA's notional schedule would be to receive solar wind data as early as 2009.   Respondents should assume that NOAA would be interested in a contract to purchase data for at least three years.  Responses shall be treated as business proprietary, in accordance with the Respondent's page notations.  Any proprietary claims must be identified in the Respondent's documentation.  However, Respondents are strongly cautioned not to exclude information that the Government needs to present a case for any future new start in the budget process.  Pages should be printed on 8  x 11 inch paper, with type no smaller than 12 point. Figures, tables and charts are not limited to 8  x 11, but must be folded to that size.  Documents must be submitted in hard copy and electronic form, in Microsoft WORD, EXCEL, or PowerPoint.  A cover sheet should be provided for each set of information in (a) through (e) above.  The Table of Contents, cover sheets, and acronym lists are not included in the number of requested pages.  The suggested maximum pages are 25, including all figures, tables and charts.  An original and five (5) copies of all information is requested, and must be submitted to the Contracting Officer.  Please also include information on the proposal title, the lead organization responding, the type of business, and contact points for members of the technical and business team.  Please contact the Contracting Officer for more information on this solicitation, at 301-713-4751.  ALL INTERESTED AND QUALIFIED VENDORS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  See Notes 25 and 26.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks information related to its Corporate Financial System Modernization initiative. This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). USDA intends to assess the capabilities and then issue an RFP at a later date to those GSA contractors it determines to be the most capable. Acquisition is currently planned to begin in FY2005.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such. 


BACKGROUND
USDA maintains a diverse and complex portfolio of over twenty-five financial and associated administrative systems. The Corporate Financial Management Sys-tems (CFMS) portfolio represents a corporate-wide solution for financial man-agement reform mandated by various statutes and regulations and establishes a basis for sound financial management at USDA.  In addition, the CFMS portfolio helps to ensure and produce complete, reliable, timely, and consistent financial information that lead to clean audited financial statements.  The key goal is to provide tools for program and financial managers to effectively manage and evaluate federal programs.  
At the core of the CFMS is the the Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS), the USDA corporate administrative financial information system imple-mented by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Associate Chief Fi-nancial Officer for Financial Systems (ACFO-FS). The FFIS system includes a USDA-configured version of the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Federal Fi-nancial System (FFS).  The FFS vendor has already developed and is marketing its new generation of core accounting system software, and will eventually dis-continue support of the old version of FFS. Consequently, USDA must replace FFIS with a system that complies with a contemporary "open system architec-ture". The CFMS also includes the Financial Data Warehouse (FDW) and the Fi-nancial Statements Data Warehouse (FSDW), the USDA financial reporting solutions, and the two data marts, the Automated Cash Reconciliation Worksheet System (ACRWS), the FFIS Customer Service Center (CSC), and more than 15 financial and administrative feeder systems. The FDW and FSDW address the financial management reporting requirements in USDA. ACRWS provides criti-cal cash management and reconciliation capabilities to resolve the USDA's long-standing cash reconciliation issues. The CSC is the customer outreach to the fi-nancial management and technical communities and maintains a database of all trouble reports. 
The COTS software for FFIS was chosen in 1994 from the mandatory Financial Management System Software (FMSS) Multiple Award Schedule. COTS soft-ware is required as specified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circu-lar, A-130, "Management of Federal Information Resources". The implementation of FFIS serves as the corporate financial systems initiative for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to achieve compliance with the CFO Act of 1990 and provides the functionality to implement the U.S. Standard General Ledger. It also addressed the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) sys-tem requirements and the consolidated reporting requirements for financial state-ments stated in OMB Circular A-127, "Financial Management Systems."
To further improve program performance and ensure that it can meet future needs, the USDA OCF) has determined that USDA needs to obtain a new core financial management system that can meet OMB circulars A-127 and A-130 for sensitive but unclassified standard general ledger. . In particular, the OCFO is seeking to replace FFIS with a JFMIP-certified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) package, with minimal customizations, that will provide online, real-time transaction and information capability and will be accessible to the central office and all bureaus. The Corporate Financial Management System initiative to be implemented is made up of the following functional areas:
General ledger
Cash Management
Grants
Loans
Accounts receivable
Accounts payable
Lockboxes
Funds management
Budget formulation
Salary Projections
Budget and performance integration
Budget planning
Budget execution
Cost management
Reporting
Treasury and Financial Management Service (FACTS 33/2108s)
OMB reporting
Agency reporting
Program reports
IRS reporting (e.g., 1099s, W02s)
Interfaces
Compliance with eGovernment initiatives (e.g., eTravel, Federal Asset Sales, Integrated Acquisition Environment, etc.)

The Corporate Financial System Modernization initiative is a complex, large-scale financial management system acquisition and implementation effort. Among other things, it will require integration with financial and administrative feeder systems, realignment of affected business processes, and clear communication to stakeholders. A successful Corporate Financial Systems Modernization will result in improved financial management reporting, accountability, and decision making throughout USDA and its agencies. It will also further USDAs implementation of key provisions in the Presidents Management Agenda, eGov requirements, and other regulatory mandates
USDA is pursuing an efficient and integrated approach that builds on government, industry, and project management best practices for acquiring a COTS financial management package and the system integration expertise to implement it. 
At its core, this approach will use a performance-based acquisition strategy that is based on effective planning and requirements gathering consistent with USDA IT policy and system development lifecycle (SDLC) guidance, and Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level 2 or higher processes. USDA plans to manage the Corporate Financial Systems Modernization using critical components of earned-value management methods for program planning, reporting, and management.


USDA Goals
Among the specific goals established for this initiative are the following:
Acquire a new core financial management system that is qualified by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP)
Provide real-time interfaces to eGovernment initiatives such as eTravel.
Ensure accuracy of reported financial data (as evidenced by unqualified audit opinions by the Office of the Inspector General for all USDA pub-lished financial statements) through the systems that prepare the state-ments
Meet EAL3 security requirements.
Satisfy the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improve-ment Act
Satisfy the requirements of the Government Management Reform Act
Proactively implement the challenges identified in the Presidents Man-agement Agenda for improving overall financial management of all fed-eral agencies
Integration of financial, budget, and performance information to support decision making
Satisfy other applicable external (outside USDA) reporting requirements such as OMB circulars A127, A123 and A130
Satisfy the Secretarys 21st Century and Competitive Workforce priorities
Provide increased analytical reporting capabilities to system users
Centralize and standardize financial management information to ensure that USDA complies with federally mandated requirements for core ac-counting and financial management and meets its business information needs.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Technology Transfer Opportunity - Trace Detection Technology
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY Trace Detection Technology
Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energys physical security needs, is looking for one or more companies in the trace detection market, including but not limited to explosives, to engage in commercialization of Sandias portable large-volume sampling preconcentrator (LVSP).  It is expected, although not necessarily required, that a company that commercializes the LVSP will incorporate it into their trace detection system.  This is for Sandias portable LVSP technology only; no detection technology is offered.

Sandia is interested in commercial system integrators with well-documented experience in trace detection, and with successful product offerings.  Potential partners must provide Sandia information demonstrating that the partner has the stand-alone (sublicensing will not be acceptable) resources and expertise to design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional preconcentration/trace detection systems.  Sandia anticipates granting one or more non-exclusive licenses to the LVSP technology to qualified participants, with up-front licensing fees (a portion of which may cover Sandias technical assistance to the partner), royalties, annual minimums, and performance milestones.  The licensee will acquire the rights to several issued patents, patents pending, and drawings of the subject technology.

The subject technology is a hand-portable large-volume sample collection and preconcentration device that, when combined with a chemical detector, is capable of detecting low concentrations of explosives.  The preconcentration device was originally developed for low vapor pressure explosives detection and has successfully concentrated a variety of these chemicals.  It has also been tested with some illicit drugs with success.  Our expectation is that the technology will be similarly effective for the detection of various chemicals and drugs, although it has not yet been thoroughly tested in these application areas.

The preconcentration device features portability, high sensitivity, ease and speed of operation, and adaptability to many detectors.  The device combines both particle and vapor collection into a single portable unit.  For particle collection, a sampling substrate is wiped across the suspect surface and inserted into the device.  For vapor collection, a blower draws a large-volume (liters per second) of air through the sampling substrate of the preconcentrator, which selectively collects the target trace elements.  These now concentrated compounds are then released into a small-volume (milliliters per minute) of gas flow that is delivered to a detector; the type of detector can vary.  The device can be integrated with a portable detection device, or can be used as a separate sampling preconcentrator.  The device can enhance the real-world detection capabilities of many detectors by delivering a concentrated sample to the detector.

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by 8 October 2003 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115. Fax (505) 844-8011. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your firm could best contribute to the commercialization of this technology.

Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide instrument definition and development consistent with the specific technology area defined below in the last section of this synopsis. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the three (3) criteria defined above. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Rosemary R. Baize, Mail Stop 469 Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB, September 3, 2003. Procurement questions should be directed to Tom Weih, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-3878, Carl.T.Weih@nasa.gov. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships.  (1) Energy Dispersive Detectors for use in X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers, Technical Point of Contact: Warren C. Kelliher, 757-864-4172, warren.c.kelliher@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively developing X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers (XRFS) for use on future Planetary and Space Exploratory missions to provide elemental analysis       of various regolith surfaces.  Based on previous experience with the XRFS used on the Viking Mission to Mars, Langley is developing state-of-the-art XRFS components to be used in different instrument configurations for in-situ analysis, remote surface analysis, and subsurface analysis. We are also interested in further development of micro and total reflection XRFS technologies for space applications.	For this specific proposal, Langley is interested in developing new energy dispersive detectors for use in XRFS that are not sensitive to the visible light spectrum, yet still have reasonable sensitivity to the low fluorescence energies of the biogenic elements, such as Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. NASA LaRC is also particularly interested in the radiation resistant, wide bandgap, semiconductor single crystals such as Diamond and Silicon Carbide.  Langley is interested in partners with the capability of growing and doping these crystals and assisting in the evaluation of their use as an energy dispersive detector.

STATEMENT OF WORK
For
LATERAL DRIFT TRAINER

The installation of dynamometers must allow users to manually adjust and determine tensioning of the 4 wire ropes.  All requests for repair must meet the standards for correct installation of the wire rope (and associated hardware) and stopping of the trolley at a predetermined stopping point.  The prestreched wire rope must allow for minimal take-up during tensioning.  The wire rope must be of the correct size to allow free movement of the current trolley to allow a forward speed no less than 5 mph.  Furthermore, a solution must be planned and performed to minimize the movement of the purlins inward toward each other during repeated tensioning so as to extend the life of the trainer and prevent costs of having the purlins removed and reset when they are pulled to far off center."

Replace all wire rope with pre-stretched galvanized wire rope [6x37 (Class) RRL EIPS IWRC] to allow for safe and correct connection to purlins and the dynamometers.  

Install on each wire rope a button swage  of the distance from the high point for a stop plate to stop the forward movement of the trolley. Stop plates and trolleys are provided by the customer.  

Replace current screw pin anchor shackles with correct size for the new installed wire rope.

Replace all turnbuckles ensuring correct size with screw pin anchor shackles and wire rope

Install on each wire rope a Dillon dynamometer (Edx-10k) or equivalent.  This will monitor the tension of the wire rope, and allow for the users to tension wire rope when needed.

Install system to prevent shifting of the purlins during repeated tensioning.

Remove all harness hardware attached to the suspend harness platform and remove all the existing eyebolts used to hang harness hardware.  Reinstall eyebolts using the proper spacers to inline the plane of the eyebolt to the load angle of the harness system when in use.

A mandatory site visit has been set for 04 Sept 03, 10:00 P.M. EST   

Work schedule for the work to be preformed by contractor must be coordinated with and approved by the 479th FTG.  

All hardware must be approved by the Contracting Officer before installation.

<DESC>Sources Sought.      The Headquarters, Air Force Services Agency, Workers Compensation Branch, (HQ AFSVA/SVXBW) is seeking a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) windows-based Workers Compensation Claims Management System (WCCMS).  The AF Workers Compensation Program is self-insured and self-administered in accordance with the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA) regulated by the US Dept of Labor (DOL).  The program provides benefits to approximately 27,000 Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees worldwide.  Since program inception in 1975, nearly 80,000 claims have been processed and current statistics indicate that an average of 1,400 new claims are processed each year.  The AF Services Agency is looking for vendors that can provide a turnkey industry standard WCCMS system that is windows-based, N-tier architecture, and supports a global Internet portal solution to provide base-level access to information and electronic submission of claims data to the program office, improves flexibility and efficiency to streamline the claims management process, and provide flexible user-designed business rules.  The system currently being used is a DOS-based claims management software system, which was tailored to manage, analyze, and monitor workers compensation claims.  Conversion of the existing WCCMS data will be required.  The architecture must be ODBE compliant, interface with Microsoft Windows 2000 Operating System and MS SQL 2000 database environments, and meet Air Force security standards.   All interested parties can request a proposal packet from Jacqueline A. Glosson at  210.652.6931 or via email at jackie.glosson@agency.afsv.af.mil or a copy can be printed using the following directions:

1.	Go to www.afnafpo.com

Glosson, 9504 IH 35 North Suite 370, San Antonio, TX 78233.  All responses shall be received no later than 4:30 P.M., 11 October 2003, Central Time Zone.  The information received will be considered confidential and will not be disclosed without the express written consent of the supplier.  Any information provided will be at no cost to the Government.  This is a nonappropriated fund purchase and it does not obligate appropriated funds of the United States Government.  Nonappropriated funds are generated by the military community through the sale of goods and services and the collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs.  This purchase does not involve federal tax dollars.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared per the format in Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number INL- G/TIP-001 is a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Government intends to award a firm, fixed price contract for the acquisition of a study/report as detailed below in the Statement of Work.    

The following Provisions and Clauses are incorporated into this RFQ by reference and are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  No addenda apply to these Provisions and Clauses.  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

Statements of work 

Background: The State Department issues a congressionally-mandated Trafficking in Persons Report assessing efforts of governments to meet certain minimum standards.  This report is compiled by the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP).  A copy of the most recent report can be found at WWW.state.gov/g/tip/.  In order for a country to be included in this report, a determination has to be made on whether there is a significant number of victims of severe forms of trafficking.  The Department of State defines significant to be on the order of 100 or more victims.  The number of trafficking victims in each country is based on information provided by U.S. embassies, NGO and media reports, meetings with foreign government officials and so on.  The State Department believes there are countries with significant numbers of trafficking victims that are not on the Trafficking in Persons Report because there was not a method to verify information on the number of victims.  The underground nature of trafficking in persons, frequent inability of the victims to identify themselves, and the reluctance of some governments to prosecute cases, only adds to the difficulties in counting victims.  Statement of work: The contractor shall conduct research on the number of victims in seven pre-selected countries -- Australia, Cyprus, Panama, Peru,  Argentina, Azerbaijan, and Eritrea.  The contractor shall work towards gathering information for recommendations on improving the methodology of counting victims.  Contractor will be required to travel to these countries to gather information on trafficking in persons including the nature of trafficking (sex and labor trafficking, and internal and cross border trafficking) and the number of victims.  The research/evaluation will result in a final, written report to the Government that will include all elements of the findings, and recommendations as described above.  Interested offerors must submit a technical proposal detailing how they will accomplish the requirements in the statement of work; qualifications of personnel who will perform under the resulting contract and past performance documentation detailing their experience in conducting similar type work with references included.   Interested offerors shall submit a firm fixed price quotation for the total price of the final report/deliverable.  A summary of the pricing to reach the firm, fixed price shall be submitted.  The Government requires the final report to delivered by March 1, 2004.  The complete solicitation is contained in this announcement.  Applicants will be evaluated on the merit of their technical proposal, on the qualifications of the personnel and on their past performance.  The Government reserves the right to check all past performance information available.  All evaluating factors will carry equal weight.  Award will be made based on lowest priced, technically acceptable.   Interested sources shall submit their proposals and quotes to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow by facsimile, fax no: 202-776-8775 or by email to: Hayes-CrowMP2@state.gov .  Closing date for submission is 9/25/03 by 4:00pm, EST.  Questions regarding the solicitation may be directed to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow by fax or e-mail.

No additional FAR clauses apply.  Interested offerors must submit a completed SF 1449 and sign Representations and Certifications per FAR 52.212-3.  The following provides the Statement of Work:

Background:  There is tremendous debate in the NGO and international community as to whether the legalization or regulation of prostitution contributes to an increase in the number of victims of sex trafficking. Countries have taken different approaches to addressing sex trafficking, for example, by regulating prostitution, criminalizing all aspects of prostitution, or de-criminalizing the victims while criminalizing the conduct of pimps, exploiters or customers, etc.  Statement of work: The contractor shall conduct research on this topic by gathering existing research as well as travel to Sweden, Italy, and the Netherlands to meet with relevant officials and NGOs whose governments have taken different approaches to addressing sex trafficking to evaluate the extent to which increased prostitution leads to an increase in victims of sex trafficking. The evaluation will result in a final, written report to the Government that will include all elements of the findings, and recommendations as described above.  Interested offerors must submit a technical proposal detailing how they will accomplish the requirements in the statement of work; qualifications of personnel who will perform under the resulting contract and past performance documentation detailing their experience in conducting similar type work with references included.   Interested offerors shall submit a firm fixed price quotation for the total price of the final report/deliverable.  A summary of the pricing to reach the firm, fixed price shall be submitted.    The completion time for this research is nine months  from date of award of contract.  The complete solicitation is contained in this announcement.  Offerors will be evaluated on the merit of their technical proposal, on the qualifications of the personnel and on their past performance.  The Government reserves the right to check all past performance information available.  All evaluating factors will carry equal weight.  Award will be made based on lowest priced, technically acceptable.  Interested sources shall submit their proposals and quotes to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow by facsimile, fax no: 202-776-8775 or by email to: Hayes-CrowMP2@state.gov .

Compilation of Best Practices by Governments to Address Demand side of Sex Trafficking and Prostitution.  Background:  The demand side of any market drives the supply side as when the supply is great but there is no demand, the supply dwindles, and it is not worth marketing.  The severe form of trafficking known as sex trafficking fulfills a demand for commercial sex acts.  These commercial sex acts are criminal acts in many countries, and are criminal acts virtually worldwide when the victim is under 18. Enhanced public awareness, strengthened sensitivity and consciousness raising -- including education targeting young boys (men are predominantly the offenders, although there are some women offenders and certainly some women facilitators) may be key components to stemming the demand.  Few countries have directed attention specifically to the demand side of trafficking.  Some NGOs (e.g., ECPAT International) have tried campaigns against commercial sex tourism as one means of deterring such practices while others have examined education in the schools (e.g, Paul and Lisa Program).  The study/research project can be accomplished with interviews and data collection currently available worldwide and within the United States.  The contractor shall be expected to meet with NGOs working with offenders as well as foreign embassy officials.  Statement of work: The contractor shall conduct secondary research to compile a list of best practices internationally and domestically to counter demand for sex trafficking and prostitution.  The research will result in a final, written report to the Government that will include findings on best practices.  The completion time for this research is six months from date of award of contract. Interested offerors must submit a technical proposal detailing how they will accomplish the requirements in the statement of work; qualifications of personnel who will perform under the resulting contract and past performance documentation detailing their experience in conducting similar type work with references included.   Interested offerors shall submit a firm fixed price quotation for the total price of the final report/deliverable.  A summary of the pricing to reach the firm, fixed price shall be submitted.  The Government requires the final report to delivered by March  1, 2004.  The complete solicitation is contained in this announcement.  Applicants will be evaluated on the merit of their technical proposal, on the qualifications of the personnel and on their past performance.  The Government reserves the right to check all past performance information available.  All evaluating factors will carry equal weight.  Award will be made based on lowest priced, technically acceptable.  Interested sources shall submit their proposals and quotes to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow by facsimile, fax no: 202-776-8775 or by email to: Hayes-CrowMP2@state.gov .  Closing date for submission is 9/25/03 by 4:00pm, EST.  Questions regarding the solicitation may be directed to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow by fax or e-mail.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: VOYAGE CHARTER FORCE PROTECTION.

(1)  Owner agrees to US Armed Forces personnel may board the vessel at any time at any location for US national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such US Armed Forces personnel on the boarding party.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to such US Armed Forces boarding party with respect to the identification of crew members or such others as may be aboard the vessel, and to permit the US Armed Forces personnel to search without limitations any and all Vessel spaces for US national security purposes.

(3) Owner consents to the immediate removal of crew members or such others as may be aboard the vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer, or US Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace a such crew member promptly and that such replacement will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charter agrees to bear reasonable costs incurred by the Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(4)  Owner understands and agrees that members of and equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the United States of America may be embarked aboard one vessel during period of the charter.  Owner agrees to provide at owners sole expense, lifesaving equipment for up to 12 personnel in compliance with SOLAS and all applicable regulatory regulations.

(B)  Objectives - 

The course objectives are to provide education to industry covering illegal drug residue avoidance of food products sold for human consumption. The course will cover both meat and milk residue avoidance practices. This training will provide an educational outlook in providing information regarding the meat and milk residue testing processes and residue avoidance practices for all types of food producers. The course will cover record keeping, drug treatment practices, animal identification, and treated animal separation requirements. The course will be conducted on one day due to food producers limited time schedules, potentially the course will only last approximately 2 hours. The course coverage will be on a strict time limit and power point slides are probably the most efficient tool to ensure time accountability. The producer segment will be limited to factors that producers have ability to control, their role in residue avoidance. In addition, there will be additional courses designed to cover the other segments of the food producing industries. For example, educational sessions (of similar duration and timing) for veterinarians, animal dealers/haulers/transporters, auction yards, and slaughter plants.
