Text cannot be extracted from the scanned PDF file.  What is the usual protocol?<br><br>Answer 4<br>No  Word version of the draft RFP will be provided.<br><br>Question 5<br>The RFP states that resumes are not included in the page count.  Are the cover page, Table of Contents, and Cross Reference Matrices also not included in the page count?<br><br>Answer 5<br>Yes, the cover page, Table of Contents and Cross Reference Matrices are included in the page count.   The page count for paragraph L.1.1, Volume I, Technical, Evaluation Task 1, 2 and 3 will be increased from 35 pages to 40 pages.<br><br>Question 6<br>Will the report "Science Application International Corporation (SAIC) Study #RM-09-004, 17 July 2009, Worker Risk due to a Leaking Munition at the Pueblo Chemical Depot - Depot and Construction Workers" used as an example under paragraph 3.4.5.3 of Sample Evaluation Task Three be made available to all bidders?<br><br>Answer 6 <br>Yes, the report will be made available upon request. <br><br>Question 7<br>The PAIS V procurement will be different from the predecessor support contracts as it will provide program, integration, and technical support  services in a maturing part of the ACAT I program; the evaluation criteria tends to reflect work that has been done over the years and does not explicitly tie to the changing nature of the support required.  The Government may want to consider novel approaches and innovative solutions that enhance and improve draw-down efficiencies as an integral part of the evaluation criteria.<br><br>Answer 7<br>Noted.<br><br>Question 8 <br>In a program/ mission with both finishing and emerging components, it is critical for PAIS V contractors to demonstrate performance when transitioning out of a task or a component of the program. The Government may want to consider inclusion of a "transition plan" or more specifically a "ramp up" or "ramp down" plan in the management volume.<br><br>Answer 8<br>It is noted in paragraph L.3.2.1.2 the minimum content for the Management Proposal. <br><br>Question 9<br>The Sample Task Order (STO) 3 evaluation Criteria seems to focus on PAIS V contractor performance risk; the ability of the proposed contractors to help reduce the programmatic risk should be an important factor.  The Government may want consider including the PAIS V contractor's abilities to assist in the reduction of  the overall ACWA Programmatic risk as an integral part of risk reduction evaluation criteria<br><br>Answer 9<br>It is noted in paragraph L.3.1.1.2.1. the Technical Approach. <br><br>Question 10<br>In Section C.3.6.8, the field operating activity (FOA) team to support PCAPP and BGCAPP for training of the work force and troubleshooting of key equipment and processes is not listed under section C.3.3., Field Office Services. Is the FOA to be single team that is responsive to the two sites or it is an embedded resource located at each site?<br><br>Answer 10<br>It is envisioned that the FOA team would be comprised mainly by embedded resources located at PCAPP & BGCAPP.<br><br>Question 11<br>In Section C.3.10.3, the second sentence related to inclusion of public affairs appears to be an internal comment and may not belong there.<br><br>Answer 11<br>The second sentence in Section C.3.10.3.  will be deleted.<br><br>Question 12<br>Section H.1.1. stipulates that contract does not require a DD form 254; but section 8.2 of sample task 3 requires DD254 to access DOD computer system. Is our assumption correct that the final section J of the RFP will have a DD form 254?<br><br>Answer 12<br>A DD form 254 is not required.   All references to a DD form 254 in paragraph 8.2 of each of the three sample tasks will be deleted.<br><br>Question 13<br>Sections H.5 & H.6 indicate that the responses to future Task Order Solicitations will include only cost and schedule. This implies less formal competition (no technical proposal, approach etc.).  Is this correct or will a technical approach be required to compete for future task orders?  A superior technical approach may present better options to the Government that will result in a lower overall programmatic life-cycle cost even though a bidder's specific task response may not be the lowest cost or shortest schedule.<br><br>Answer 13<br>Future task orders will be competed against the evaluation criteria/selection approach identified when solicited.  <br><br>Question 14<br>Will the number of trips be normalized for STO 1 during the cost realism assessment or would the Army consider providing an anticipated number of trips similar to STO 3?<br><br>Answer 14 <br>The contractor will be required to travel in accordance with paragraphs 3.2., 3.2.1., 3.2.4, and 3.5 of the performance work statement for STO 1.<br> <br>Question 15<br>Page 45, section 3.2, directs the contractor to assume 24 trips for 1 person for 4 days to Pine Bluff Arsenal and Deseret Chemical Depot. Is the intent for the contractor to assume 24 trips total, spread across both locations?<br><br>Answer 15<br>For estimating purposes assume 12 trips to Pine Bluff Arsenal and 12 trips to Deseret Chemical Depot.  Paragraph 3.2, page 45, will be changed.<br><br>Question 16<br>Page 45, section 3.2.1 specifies that four FTE will be located at the NSCMP offices five days per week.  Are all of these staff to be located at APG or will they be located across each of the four NSCMP sites (APG, PBA, Huntsville, and DCD)?<br><br>Answer 16<br>The staff are to be located at APG.  The staff will travel to the other sites.   <br><br>Question 17<br>Page 46, section 3.5, directs the contractor to assume 3 trips for 1 person for 4 days to Pine Bluff Arsenal and Deseret Chemical Depot. Is the intent for the contractor to assume spread across both locations (i.e. a total of 3 trips) or is it three trips to each location (i.e., a total of 6 trips)?<br><br>Answer 17<br>For purposes of estimating assume 3 trips to each location for a total of 6 trips.<br><br>Question 18<br>Page 46, section 3.4 of STO 1 requests 0.25 FTE for integration support and analysis. It directs the contractor to assume 500 professional hours for the task. As such, should the contractor assume, for all sample tasks, that the standard for a full FTE is 2000 hours?  This is inconsistent with page 45 section 3.2 that specifies four FTEs at 7600 hours.  How many total hours does the government expect the contractor to use for a standard FTE?<br><br>Answer 18<br>8000<br><br>Question 19<br>Page 96, section 3.5.5, requests the contractor to participate in one, four hour briefing with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. Is it correct to assume that this would be a teleconference, and that no travel dollars should be allocated for this meeting?<br><br>Answer 19<br>No, assume a 2 day trip to the CDC offices in Atlanta, Georgia.  <br><br>Question 20<br>Section C - Performance Work Statement does not contain Public Outreach Support scope yet Section J, Sample Task 2 includes this scope at the field office.  Including public outreach support in the field office tasks has resulted in improved communications and cost efficiencies for the Program.  Given the status of mission at each site, it would be most effective to keep that scope available for the appropriate field office tasks.  Please confirm that public outreach scope will be included in the Performance Work Statement to support the field office public outreach requirements.<br><br>Answer 20<br>Paragraph C.3.3.10 will be added to state, "The contractor shall provide site specific public outreach support as required."<br><br>Question 21<br>Paragraph L.2.2 recommends the use of indices and cross-reference matrices and paragraphs L.3.1.1.1 and L.3.2.1.1 specify the use of indices in the Technical Proposal for the sample tasks and the Management Proposal, respectively. Are these and any front matter such as acronym lists excluded from page count? <br><br>Answer 21<br>The indices, cross-reference matrices, and acronym lists, are counted in the page limit.<br><br>Question 22<br>Section L.2.4 indicates that the offeror's proposal shall be printed in a 12 point font (foldout pages or electronic spreadsheets - 10 point font) with one-inch margins (top, bottom, left and right).  Is it also permissible to use 10 point font for graphics and tables, regardless of whether the graphic or table is on an 8.5x11 page or an 11x17 fold out?<br><br>Answer 22<br>This is acceptable.<br><br>Question 23<br>Draft Solicitation Sections L.2.2, L.3.1.1.1, L.3.2.1.1, and L.3.3 request the use of cross-reference indices with the proposal. Are these indices included or excluded from volume page limits? <br><br>Answer 23<br>The cross-reference indices are counted in the volume page limits.  The page limits have been adjusted in L.1.1., Volume 1. <br><br>Question 24<br>Draft Solicitation Section L.1.1 indicates that Proposal Volume II, Past Performance Factor does not have a page limit. Draft Solicitation Section L.3.3.2.2, however, concludes by stating that "[t]he offeror shall not exceed two (2) pages for each contract cited." Please clarify if L.3.3.2.2 refers to the entirety of the offeror's information for each contract cited or to a specific portion of the past performance data.<br><br>Answer 24<br>Past Performance Factor is Volume III.   Paragraph L.3.3.2.2. limits information for each contract cited to two (2) pages in its entirety.<br><br>Question 25<br>Draft Solicitation Section L.3.5.1.2 states that "[t]he offeror shall submit supporting computations and summaries contained in the cost proposal on CD-ROM using Excel." Should the offeror submit an individual CD-ROM for each Evaluation Task, or should supporting data for Evaluation Tasks 1 through 3 appear on separate discs?<br><br>Answer 25<br>The offeror shall submit a separate disk for each sample task including all computations and supporting data.<br><br>Question 26<br>Draft Solicitation Section L.3.2.1.1 states that Proposal Volume II, Management and Related Corporate Experience Factors shall 'have an index that contains narrative titles which are cross-referenced to the offeror's discussion.' Please clarify what information should be cross-referenced.<br><br>Answer 26<br>The Management Volume should cross reference back to section C, performance work statement, paragraphs 3.2 thru 3.10.<br><br>Question 27<br>Since our company will be proposing Facilities Capital Cost of Money, it is requested that FAR 52.215-17, Waiver of Facilities Capital Cost of Money, be removed from the solicitation.<br><br>Answer 27<br>Both need to be included in solicitation.  The resultant contract will identify one or the other. <br><br>Question 28<br>FAR Clause 52.228-4, Workers' Compensation and War-Hazard Insurance Overseas, relates to insurance requirements for work being performed outside of the United States.  It is our understanding that all work under this solicitation will be performed within the United States; therefore, this clause would not apply.  Please clarify.<br><br>Answer 28<br>The clause will be deleted.<br><br>Question 29<br>DFAR Clause 252.237-7006, Subcontracting, requires Contracting Officer approval of all subcontracting and is prescribed via 237.7003(b) for inclusion in all mortuary services solicitations.  As such, it is requested that this clause be removed.<br><br>Answer 29<br>The clause will be deleted<br><br><br>Question 30<br>If there are Program Management/Project Control/Administrative direct charge labor hours and/or any associated other direct costs above and beyond the labor hours and travel specified in any or all of the individual Task Orders should they be included in the Task Order Cost Estimate or should they be included in some yet to be specified Program Management Task for the overall PAIS V Contract?<br><br>Answer 30<br>All costs to perform the tasks should be included in the estimate for each task order.<br><br>Question 31<br>Paragraph C.3.2.9 addresses providing operations and maintenance support for IPMS but does not include AIPMS. Will IPMS supplant AIPMS?<br><br>Answer 31<br>No.<br><br>Question 32<br>IPMS, addressed in Paragraph C.3.2.9, has been used for CRDLS A001 and A002 report submittal under the current PAIS IV contract. The CDRLS indicated that the preferred method of submitting the Monthly Progress Report and Monthly Progress and Status Report is the latest version of Microsoft Office products in lieu of IPMS discussed in Section C.3.2.9, is that the intent?<br><br>Answer 32<br>Yes, the intent is to do Microsoft office products.<br><br>Question 33<br>Sample Evaluation Task 3 Paragraph 3.4.4 requires the contractor to "maintain, update, or upgrade the existing chemical weapons risk models (information and programming) for BGCAPP and PCAPP."  In order to estimate the level of effort required for this task could access to the risk models be provided with release of the Final RFP?<br><br>Answer 33<br>The risk models cannot be directly provided.  For estimating purposes assume 1.5 FTE's. <br><br>Question 34<br>Sample Evaluation Task 3 Paragraph 3.4.4 requires the contractor to "maintain, update, or upgrade the existing chemical weapons risk models (information and programming) for BGCAPP and PCAPP."  In order to estimate the level of effort required for this task could the Government provide additional guidance as to the requirements that should be assumed for proposal purposes?<br><br>Answer 34<br>The chemical weapons risk models must take into account previous actual chemical demilitarization accident types and rates for equipment and operations at chemical agent storage, operational, and demilitarization facilities with respect to explosive and chemical agent associated hazards and risks.  It must also take into account accident rates and failures of items in industry (e.g. valves, tanks, piping, processing equipment, etc.) in order to build a database of information to draw from in a quantitative manner.  The model then applies this quantitative data in a risk assessment of PM ACWA facility operations to derive quantitative risk based profiles for both workers and the general public from chemical agent exposure and explosive hazards for ACWA operations. The models should be reviewed every six months to incorporate evaluation of new incidents, new techniques, or design changes at ACWA facilities.  In addition the model platform should be evaluated and chosen to allow for upgrades through completion of the ACWA program.<br><br>Question 35<br>To support an evaluation of the requirements for Sample Evaluation Task 3, could the Government provide access to the qualitative and quantitative risk assessments that have been performed in support of the ACWA program over the last five years?<br><br>Answer 35<br>The BGCAPP Screening QRA for Public Risk will be made available upon request. It describes the risk assessment methods used and illustrates the level of detail expected.<br><br>Question 36<br>Sample Evaluation Task 3 Paragraph 3.4.5.3 references SAIC Study #RM-09-004, 17 July 2009, Worker Risk due to a Leaking Munition at PCD.  Could this study be made available to the offerors with the release of the Final RFP?<br><br>Answer 36<br>Yes, the report will be made available to all bidders.<br><br>Question 37<br>Sample Evaluation Task 3, Paragraphs 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 refer to specific travel that is different than the travel required in Paragraph 9.0 TRAVEL. Is the travel in Paragraphs 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 in addition to the specified travel in Paragraph 9.0?<br><br>Answer 37<br>The travel in Paragraphs 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 are not in addition to the travel specified in Paragraph 9.0; Paragraph 9.0 includes all the travel in Paragraphs 3.5.4 and 3.5.5.  Paragraphs 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 provide more detail about the purpose of one visit to PCAPP, one visit to BGCAPP, and one visit to the CDC.  However, Paragraphs 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 only include time spent at the site itself; Paragraph 9.0 also includes time spent traveling to and from the site.In paragraph 9.0 travel will include one (1) person, for two (2) days trip to Atlanta, GA to visit CDC.<br><br>Question 38<br>Paragraph L.3.2.2, Related Corporate Experience, requests the offerors discuss their Corporate Experience related to the Chem Demil Program; however, there does not appear to be a corresponding evaluation criteria in Section M. Could the Government provide the evaluation criteria for Paragraph L.3.2.2, Related Corporate Experience in the Final RFP?<br><br>Answer 38<br>Paragraph M.4.4. Related Corporate Experience Factor will be added to the final RFP.  The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror has demonstrated that it possesses the depth and breadth of corporate experience necessary to perform efforts relevant to program management, integration and technical support that are applicable to the CMA and ACWA chemical demilitarization missions. <br><br>Question 39<br>Paragraph L.3.2.1.2.3, Facilities, requires the offerors to present a description of their facilities. Is it a requirement of the Contract to have a Laboratory capable of handling and analyzing for chemical agents?<br><br>Answer 39<br>No.   <br><br>Question 40<br>Paragraph 5.2 in Sample Evaluation Tasks 1, 2 and 3 require a Final Comprehensive Report to be produced at the conclusion of the tasks. This Final Comprehensive Report is not discussed elsewhere in the Sample Evaluation Tasks. Could the Government elaborate on the elements of the Final Comprehensive Reports especially with relation to Sample Evaluation Tasks 2 and 3? <br><br>Answer 40<br>The elements of the Final Comprehensive Reports especially with relation to Sample Evaluation Tasks 2 and 3 are in accordance with Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) A003, DI-MISC-80711A.<br><br>Question 41<br>The three Sample Evaluation Tasks cover some, but not all, of the services identified as required in Section C "Description and Specifications" of the Draft Request for Proposal (RPF).

Title: NAMRU-D Research Support Services

The contractor shall provide services at NAMRU-D located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  

NAMRU-D is a component of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED).  The contractor shall support the mission of NAMRU-D in maximizing war fighter performance and survivability through world-class aeromedical and environmental health research by delivering solutions to the field, the Fleet and for the future.  The contractor shall support research studies and analyses to understand the human cognitive, and physiological factors associated with military operations in the aviation, underwater, and special warfare environments especially as they relate to motion sickness (e.g., sea-sickness, air-sickness, simulator-sickness and space-sickness), pulmonary toxicology, environmental toxicology, aeromedical standards, hypoxia, fatigue assessment, aviation safety, and neurocognitive / neurophysiologic exposure effects.
  The contractor will support research studies on environmental and occupational exposures, particularly in deployed environments, in order to identify toxic effects before health and operational performance is compromised in the warfighter. This research effort will require the accumulation and analysis of data, computer programming, and statistical analysis. As an integral portion of these research activities, the contractor shall be expected to support and perform daily routine set-ups and maintenance of critical human experimental devices at NAMRU-D. These devices include the Disorientation Research Device (DRD), the Visual Vestibular Sphere Device (VVSD), the Vertical Linear Accelerator (VLA), as well as other aircraft motion and orientation simulators.

Contractor shall support coordination with other Navy commands when necessary to complete the various research programs in place. Preparation of survey materials and psychological assessment materials, conducting literature reviews and preparation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) materials shall also be required. 

The Government envisions a single award ID/IQ contract, in which Task Orders will be issued for specific services. The services required are non-personal in nature and will be performance based.  The contract is will consist of a base and four option years.
 The guaranteed minimum is anticipated to be $25,000.00.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. This requirement is a full and open competition with no set- asides.  A solicitation will be posted on or about 6/10/2011 to the Naval Medical Logistics Commands website at http://www.nmlc.med.navy.mil/DBU-RFP.asp

The Government reserves the right to change any of this information.

<DESC>The FAA intends to negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract with Firm Fixed, Cost-Reimburseable, and Labor-Hour pricing arrangements to provide the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) labor, facilities, equipment, replacement parts, supplies, materials (direct and indirect), fixtures, tools, test equipment, and appropriate technical data to restore and modify Government-owned components of the F420 Wind Measuring System to a completely serviceable condition in accordance with original manufacturer's specifications and applicable FAA standards.  Electric Speed Indicator Co Inc. will be required to perform repairs, repairs and returns (R&Rs), modification / upgrades to serviceable assets, and technical / engineering assistance incorporating all quality control requirements and testing / inspection necessary as required by the FAA prior to acceptance of services performed.
The FAA has made a single source determination insofar that Electric Speed Indicator Co., Inc., Cleveland, Ohio is the original manufacturer of the F420 Wind Measuring System and there are no other manufacturers.  Electric Speed Indicator Co Inc. is the sole holder of proprietary data on all F420 Wind Measuring System parts and will not release detailed information to FAA for fabrication in-house or by others.  As such, the FAA must rely on the expertise and availability of this firm for repair parts and services.  It would not be cost-effective or practical for any other sources to acquire and/or develop manufacturing or repair capabilities for this item given the FAA's repair turn-around-times, repair lead time, and procurement lead time for this system.  A fair and reasonable price will be negotiated by FAA with Electric Speed Indicator Co., for all deliverables under this acquisition.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  
This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.
Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), Paragraph 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures.
Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Cilony Alejandro, Contract Specialist, by 4:00 PM CT (Oklahoma Time) Wednesday, May 25, 2011, via email at cilony.alejandro@faa.gov 
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs in response to this announcement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to VJ Technologies, 89 Carlough Rd, Bohemia, NY 11716 for non-destructive digital x-ray inspection of 116 each Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) lightweight armor (LWA) panels at Assault Craft Unit Five  (ACU-5) onboard Camp Pendleton, CA.  The order will contain an option to x-ray an additional 290 LWA panels at ACU-4 onboard the Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek, VA.  VJ Technologies developed proprietary unique software capable of identifying cracks in the LCAC armor panels.  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the current inspection requirement as it would add significant testing cost and time delays required to develop alternative software that would not be recoverable through competition.
  Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase non-destructive digital X-Ray inspection services from VJ Technologies for this requirement.  Interested Contractors may submit their interest and capability to the agency point of contact at: tim.e.reed1@navy.mil.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Please quote price and lead time.
<p>Source source selection will be base upon the low-price / technically acceptable method.</p>
<p>Provide technical data sheets or documentation in support of your offer.</p>
<p>This is a new twin anode X-Ray source specially designed by PSP Vacuum Technology for the surface science research market. The TX400 can be fitted with a variety of anode materials. It is easily adapted to most UHV systems and can be supplied with direct or differential pumping</p>
<p>Features of the TX400 Twin anode X-Ray source<br />-Great specifications at an attractive price. <br />-Twin anode source with choice of anodes Mg, Al, Ti, Si, Ag, Zr... <br />-Aligned anode ensures reliable operation to 15KV. <br />-Thoriated Tungsten twin filaments for bright emission and stability <br />-Pre jigged filaments for quick and easy replacement <br />-Shaped end caps to bring gun close to sample <br />-50 mm and 100 mm linear retractor options <br />-Differential or direct pumping configurations <br />-Custom length to suit your UHV chamber at no extra cost. <br />-Al foil window isolates sample from anode. <br />-Power supply regulated to better than 0.1% <br />-Power supply operates filaments in both emission and current stabilized modes. <br />-Single multi way filament feed-through. - one clamp for water and HT.</p>
<p>Power Supply<br />The power supply provides the high voltage and filament control to operate the source at power levels up to 500 W. The filaments can be run in either the stabilized current or stabilized emission mode. Safety interlocks are provided to shut off the unit in the event of a water cooling failure.</p>
<p>Voltage Regulation: &lt; 0.005% for specified line variations<br />Ripple: &lt; 0.02% of rated voltage at 0.5% rms<br />Stability: 0.01% /hr after 30 min warm up. 0.05% / 8hrs</p>
<p>Mechanical Details of the TX400 X-Ray Source<br />The source has twin anodes with independent filaments to provide two separate excitation energies. Any combination of anodes can be chosen from Mg, Al, Ti, Ag, and Zr. The anodes are replaceable so spare anodes can be provides with different anode materials. The exit aperture has an aluminum foil window to reduce Bremsstrahlung radiation and to isolate the anode for differential pumping. The anode is water cooled.</p>
<p>Differential Pumping<br />The X-Ray source is mounted on a standard 70 mm OD CF style flange. The source may be pumped directly through the mounting port. It is better practice to pump X ray sources with a separate pump. This completely eliminates contamination for the source and maintains UHV. A differential pumping kit is available for this purpose. This comprises a small pump, bellows connection and pressure equalization valve that are connected to the X-Ray pumping port. In this configuration the barrel of the source is sealed with a sleeve.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT), located in Huntsville, Alabama, gives notice of the contemplated release of Request For Proposal (RFP) W9113M-11-R-0003 for the effort entitled "Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Contract (SETAC) 2010".  These requirements were previously synopsized under Draft RFP W9113M-10-R-0001.  This final RFP W9113M-11-R-0003, including all solicitation requirements, will supersede the Draft RFP in its entirety.  <br><br>This contemplated effort is the fourth in a lineage of SETAC contractual vehicles for these performance-based advisory and assistance services, and will satisfy recurring requirements for systems engineering and technical assistance for USASMDC/ARSTRAT and other associated defense organizations in support of their various air, space, missile defense, homeland security/homeland defense, warfighter, and cyber missions as they are defined by Congress, Higher Headquarters, and the Department of Defense.  The goal of these services is to ensure timely, energetic, and cost effective outcomes in the development of technologies and capabilities for defense against evolving threats; to coordinate all technology base development to maximize benefits for strategic and theater missile defense and air/space technology programs; and to ensure programs are in statutory and regulatory compliance.  These recurring support requirements are categorized into nine functional area requirements:  Programmatic and Business Initiatives; Requirements Definition, Analysis, Integration, and Planning; Concept Development and Assessment; Program/Project Analysis and Assessment; Threat Estimation and Projection; Weapons Lethality, Survivability, Electronic Warfare and Kill Assessment and Effects Estimation; Engineering and Analysis Support to Assess Technology, Models, Simulations and Prototype; Logistics Assessment; and Environmental, Treaty and Security Compliance.<br><br>The SETAC 2010 requirement is anticipated to be executed as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns and awarded on a competitive, multiple-award basis considering all qualified small businesses submitting proposals.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a size standard of 1000 employees.<br><br>It is anticipated that up to five prime contract awards will be made as a result of the solicitation, with one of these awards reserved for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and that each prime contract awardee will be guaranteed at least one task order award with a minimum obligation of $150,000.  The planned business arrangement for this contemplated effort is a multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (MAIDIQ) task ordering vehicle that utilizes Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) task order types.  It is anticipated that this effort will consist of a base ordering period of two (2) years and an optional ordering period of an additional 3 years, and will include a program-level ceiling value of $997,000,000 that will be shared among all prime contract awardees.  <br><br>Potential offerors are advised that performance of these advisory and assistance services may create potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) as contemplated by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.505; therefore, stringent OCI provisions will be included in the solicitation <br>and any resulting contracts, and detailed OCI mitigation plans will be required.  Potential offerors are further advised that in order to be considered for a contract award for this requirement: (1) prime offerors must possess a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability, (2) all contractor personnel performing at the Government's site must possess, at minimum, a SECRET security clearance,  and (3) prime offerors, major subcontractors/team members, and non-major subcontractors/team members proposed to perform on a cost-reimbursement basis, must possess an adequate accounting system. No foreign participation will be allowed either at the prime or subcontract level.<br><br>It is anticipated that RFP W9113M-11-R-0003 will be formally issued and available for download from the USASMDC/ARSTRAT public website on or about 10 June 2011.  The public website is located at http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/smdc/.  The RFP can be accessed within the public website's Business Opportunities link under the title "Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Contract (SETAC)-10".  The direct link to the SETAC 2010 site is http://www.smdc.army.mil/2008/SETAC10.asp.  The estimated proposal due date will be 30 days from the date of final solicitation issuance.   The Government DOES NOT intend to conduct a pre-proposal/industry day conference for this acquisition.<br><br>All communication concerning this acquisition must be coordinated through the Contracting Officer; any communications with anyone other than the Contracting Officer are inappropriate and can result in the potential offeror being excluded from participation in this acquisition. The Contracting Officer for this solicitation is Mr. Stephen Hayes, 256-955-4340, stephen.hayes@smdc.army.mil.  Alternate POC is Mr. Elbert Clarke, 256-955-3420, elbert.clarke@sdmc.army.mil.<br><br>NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.  Questions or correspondence should be directed to Mr. Stephen Hayes, Contracting Officer, via email stephen.w.hayes@smdc.army.mil, with a copy to Mr. Elbert Clarke, elbert.clarke@sdmc.army.mil.

(FAR 52.236-12, Cleaning Up)    The contractor shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing by the COR or his designee, obliterate all signs of temporary construction facilities such as haul roads, work areas, structures, foundations or temporary structures, stockpiles of excess or waste materials, and other vestiges of construction prior to final acceptance of the work.  The disturbed areas shall be graded, backfilled, raked, and compacted.  Areas located in grassed areas shall be backfilled with topsoil, raked free of rocks, and seeded.  Areas located on asphalt or concrete shall be swept clean. Any and all waste products created during performance of the work shall be removed from the project site, packaged in an environmentally approved manner and disposed of OFF-POST at an environmentally approved disposal site.  Fifty percent, at a minimum, of all construction and demolition (CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION (C&D)) wastes shall be diverted and recycled. <br><br>C.1.4.  Environmental Work Statement clause for all exterior work (SWPPP):<br>Through the Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (AZPDES) permitting program, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) regulates the discharge of storm water from construction sites throughout the state including those on military installations. <br>"Construction" refers to actions that result in a disturbance of the land, including clearing, grading, excavating, and other similar activities. It also includes "construction-related activities," areas that support the construction project such as stockpiles, borrow areas, concrete truck washouts, fueling areas, material storage areas and equipment storage areas. <br>The AZPDES Storm water Program requires operators of construction sites one acre or larger (including smaller sites that are part of a larger common plan of development) to obtain authorization to discharge storm water under an AZPDES construction storm water permit. The Contractor is responsible for determining whether its construction site will exceed this minimum threshold with consideration of the definition provided above and if so, obtaining coverage under an AZPDES construction storm water permit.  <br>Obtaining coverage under an AZPDES permit entails preparing and implementing a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) in accordance with ADEQ requirements and submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) for coverage under the applicable AZPDES general permit.   Once ADEQ receives the NOI, ADEQ then issues an authorization certificate to the Contractor.  If a contractor has a sub-contractor working together on the same project, then the contractor and sub-contractor(s) will have to submit a NOI for the same job and separate authorization certificates will be issued to each party. <br>If the Contractor determines that the project will not exceed the minimum threshold and does not submit an NOI and it is later determined that the threshold is exceeded, the Contractor will be required to stop all work until they have completed the above process.  If the appropriate documentation is not provided to the Government prior to the start of construction or once the threshold is exceeded, the Contracting Officer will be notified of the failure to comply with a contract requirement, the ADEQ Enforcement Section will be notified, and other appropriate action will be taken to resolve the matter.  The Contractor and any sub-contractor(s) will be liable for any fines levied by ADEQ.<br>A critical component of the SWPPP is final site stabilization.  This generally involves restoring the disturbed area to at least 70% of its former vegetative state.  After implementing all aspects of the SWPPP, to include final site stabilization, the contractor submits a Notice of Termination to ADEQ, ending coverage under the AZPDES permit.  <br>An example SWPPP can be found at the following website:<br>	http://cfpub1.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/swppp.cfm<br>The Contractor is encouraged to follow the format and content of the sample SWPPP.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to develop a SWPPP that meets applicable requirements; the Government will not review the Contractor SWPPP for compliance with applicable laws.  The Contractor and any sub-contractor(s) shall provide a copy of the ADEQ Authorization Certificate and a copy of the SWPPP to the Government employee performing construction oversight prior to any construction or construction-related activities as defined above.<br>The Contractor is encouraged to follow the format and content of the sample SWPPP.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to develop a SWPPP that meets applicable requirements; the Government will not review or approve the Contractor SWPPP for compliance with applicable laws.  <br><br>C.1.5.  INSPECTION<br>All work is subject to inspection and testing by the Government at all places and at all reasonable times before acceptance, in accordance with FAR 52.246-12, Inspection of Construction.  Government inspections and tests do not relieve the contractor of the responsibility for providing adequate quality control measures, nor does it constitute or imply Government acceptance of the work.  The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not relieve the contractor of complying with the specified requirements, nor is the Government inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the specification without the Contracting Officer's written authorization.<br>C.1.6.  1354 WORKSHEET PREPARATION<br>The contractor shall prepare a DD Form 1354 Information Worksheet near completion of the project and submit it to the Government prior to final inspection and acceptance.

<RESPDATE>062311
<ARCHDATE>09232011
<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, Fax (703) 292-9140, Email pfranzel@nsf.gov
<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is seeking information regarding the availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the re-supply of the U.S. Antarctic Program's (USAP) McMurdo Station. NSF is the U.S. Government Agency responsible for directing and funding the USAP, and manages the entire United States national program in Antarctica, including logistic support activities, so that the program may be managed as a single package.
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>
<p>NSF is interested in contracting for icebreaking services to annually open a channel through first year and multi-year (typically not more than four-year old) 10/10ths sea ice, and the escort of an ice-strengthened tanker and an ice-strengthened cargo ship to the pier at McMurdo Station (77&deg;51' S, 166&deg;40' E). NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement and is also interested in short-term availability. The contract could include annual mobilization and de-mobilization costs and periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60&deg; S of approximately 4 to 5 weeks. After that period the vessel could be off-contract and free to engage in other work.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) using its POLAR class icebreaking ships. However, these vessels are not currently available. More recently, NSF has chartered the Swedish icebreaker Oden to perform the break-in and ship escort. NSF is now exploring potential alternative options for opening the supply channel to McMurdo Station through a reliable long-term arrangement, either with a commercial or governmental provider, or through a multi-national arrangement. <br /><br />NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c).</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The United States Antarctic Program</strong></span></p>
<p>Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported by the United States Government in Antarctica. The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research. For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica.</p>
<p>The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated. U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research. At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and many of them are involved in Antarctic field activities. The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations.</p>
<p>McMurdo Station is the major USAP logistics hub for the support of continental-based science. McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea. It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail. Refer to http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/ail/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Typical Schedule and Operations</strong></span></p>
<p>The icebreaker typically passes 60&deg;S latitude en route to McMurdo on or about 10 January. Departure from McMurdo is at the conclusion of the resupply mission in mid-February (4-5 weeks after arrival). The basic tasks are to open an appropriately-wide and ice-milled channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required.</p>
<p>The actual cargo and tanker ships to be used during the 2011/2012 season have not yet been identified. However, it can be expected that the cargo ship will have a gross displacement of about 15,000 tons, a length of about 500ft and a beam of about 75ft. The tanker will have a gross displacement of about 40,000 tons, a length of about 600ft and a beam of about 90ft. Use of supply ships of similar capacity and size are anticipated over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>The Military Sealift Command (U.S. Navy) provides these vessels for the USAP. The tanker arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about 26 January and departs about 31 January each year. The cargo ship arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about 2 February and departs about 10 February each year. At times the order of arrival of these ships is switched, but the USAP resupply window is ideally between 25 January and 15 February each year.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sea Ice</strong></span></p>
<p>The fast ice in McMurdo Sound in January has typically been between ten and 16 feet in thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo. Historically, this ice is only first-year ice approximately every three to five years. However, ice that developed over the 1998 winter became affixed in McMurdo Sound and, assisted by the presence at the entrance of the Sound of several very large icebergs for a couple years in the early 2000's, it grew to a thickness of more than 23ft and remained firmly in place until 2011. All of the fast ice released dramatically during a 10-day period between 14 and 24 February, 2011; therefore, first-year ice will be present throughout McMurdo Sound during the 2012 USAP icebreaking mission.</p>
<p>Sea ice in McMurdo Sound commonly has a snow cover of between six inches and two feet. Generally, snow depth increases the closer the ice is to McMurdo, in part because the typical path of icebreaking gets closer to Ross Island as the distance to McMurdo diminishes. (Appendix 1 shows McMurdo Sound and the typical icebreaking path.) Pressure ridges are rare in McMurdo Sound sea ice, but occasionally are present when multi-year ice in excess of four-years old constrains the first-year ice of the re-frozen shipping channel.</p>
<p>Appendix 2 contains a listing of the extent of fast sea ice (measured north from McMurdo Station at the time of icebreaker arrival) and the icebreaking vessels used since 1957. Recent archival images may be viewed at: http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/?RossSea/ and http://www.usap.gov/videoClipsAndMaps/satImages/.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission of Information</span></strong></p>
<p>Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its assessment of the availability and reliability of icebreaking services; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted. Except as identified herein, no specific format is required.</p>
<p>Among the factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an existing or to-be-built vessel for icebreaking services would be:</p>
<p>&bull; Intended vessel's actual certified or anticipated ice classification and maximum ice thickness and speed of advance for continuous progress<br />&bull; Society providing ice certification<br />&bull; Vessel's displacement<br />&bull; Statement of availability<br />&bull; Ship's registry<br />&bull; Vessel's or vessels' name and specifications using BIMCO Supplytime 89, Annex A as the format<br />&bull; Name/address of vessel's owner and vessel's operator (if different)<br />&bull; Time remaining prior to any major maintenance activity and dry docking<br />&bull; Approximate price per day, and any extras (e.g., taxes, victuals, commissions, communications, fuels, oils, lubricants)<br />&bull; Expected mobilization and demobilization charges and port of initiation/return<br />&bull; Past performance contact information<br />&bull; Special operating restrictions or conditions</p>
<p>Any vessel operating in Antarctic waters (defined as south of 60&deg;S latitude) must adhere to all MARPOL and IMO regulations, including a prohibition on the carriage or consumption of heavy fuels. Please specify what fuel type will be used by the intended vessel.</p>
<p>It is highly desirable that the vessel have sufficient fuel bunkering capacity to complete the USAP mission without re-fueling south of 60&deg;S latitude. Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the capacity to enable this.</p>
<p>If the vessel must receive fuel during the period of time while operating in the Southern Ocean, McMurdo can provide an all purpose diesel fuel, JP-5. Specifications for this fuel can be found at http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/FEDMIL/dtl5624u.pdf. Respondents are asked to review this fuel specification and comment on its suitability. If another diesel fuel must be used (e.g. MGO or MDO), NSF can have it delivered by the USAP tanker. If bunkering in the McMurdo area is required, please provide an estimate of the quantity of fuel that must be delivered and the proposed ship's ability to perform ship-to-ship refueling. There is no storage capacity for specialty fuels in McMurdo, thus the fuel must be delivered directly from the tanker.</p>
<p>Where fuel is expected to be provided at McMurdo, NSF will establish that fuel's value for credit to the overall cost of icebreaking services.</p>
<p>The Committee of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) has developed ballast water management guidelines. Please comment on your ability to comply with the guidelines (http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/att345_e.pdf).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation. Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to June 23, 2011 is requested. Submissions and other inquiries should be addressed to Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, pfranzel@nsf.gov, via e-mail.</p>

<CONTACT>Howard Nesmith, Phone 870-543-7459, Email howard.nesmith@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Jefferson Laboratories, in Jefferson, Arkansas, is conducting market research to support a Center for Biological Evaluation &amp; Research (CBER) requirement for a Multidetection Microplate Reader. The Division of Product Quality (DPQ), is responsible for lot-release testing before biological drugs are approved for release to the general public. The Multidetection Microplate Reader will be used for specific measurement of thrombin activity of immunoglobulin for intravenous (IGIV) products using a fluorogenic substrate method. This assay is a dynamic test for thrombin generation versus test time. This analysis will ultimately be used to evaluate samples submitted for lot release. The laboratory performing this assay will be operating under International Standard (ISO) 17025 which are general requirements for competence of testing and calibration laboratories. Therefore any equipment operated in the laboratory must conform to the requirements outlined in the standard.</p>
<p>Currently, DPQ is in the process of transferring the Test Method used to evaluate the products described above. During development, the Multidetection Microplate Reader will be the main instrument used in the assay. Once the assay is successfully transferred, the instrument will be used for lot release activity under ISO 17025 requirements, therefore annual preventive maintenance is required to be performed by qualified personnel.</p>
<p>Only new equipment will be considered. Used or refurbished equipment will not acceptable.</p>
<p>Item #1<br />Multidetection Microplate Reader</p>
<p>Automated Dichroic based microplate reader for measurement of Absorbance, Fluorescence Intensity, Time Resolved Fluorescence, Dual Emission Fluorescence, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Z-Axis Focusing (Z-Height Optimization).</p>
<p>The device should be capable of handling 96 and 384 well plates. The speed of the instrument must fall at or below 40 seconds for the whole plate. The assay to be performed requires temperature and dynamic control therefore must provide 37 degree temperature incubation. The ability to control the Z-position (axis) is vital to reading measurements. As the assay is a fluorescent and absorbance based, the reader must have the capability to read both. Reports will be generated and exported in an Excel format to ultimately be read by a OriginPro 8.5 (Origin Labs Corp.) software, which is used to analyze data generated from the microplate reader. The software provided by the instrument must be able to control reading the plates. The assay will be used for lot release activity under ISO 17025 requirements, therefore annual preventive maintenance is required to be performed by qualified personnel. In order to accurately perform calibration and preventative maintenance an IQOQ QC plate with software functions should be included. The device must include an operator/user manual. Types of available training should also be included in the package. The device should be compatible with the existing ISO 17025 Laboratory Test Method used in the Division of Hematology laboratory.</p>
<p>Including the following characteristics:<br />&#61607; Bottom Read VIS<br />&#61607; 380nm Fluorescence Filter, BW+/-20nm<br />&#61607; 430nm Fluorescence Filter, BW+/-35nm<br />&#61607; Ability to measure in wavelength range 230-900 nm for Fluorescence and 230-1000 nm for Absorbance<br />&#61607; Temperature control at 37o C<br />&#61607; Heated incubation to 42&ordm;C<br />&#61607; Shaking capabilities<br />&#61607; Accommodates plate formats from 6 to 384 wells in all detection modes<br />&#61607; Capable to read 96-well and 384 -wells in less than 40 seconds<br />&#61607; One 6 position bar-coded excitation slide<br />&#61607; One 6 position bar-coded emission slide<br />&#61607; Obtain optimal Z-position of wells in real time<br />&#61607; Read absorbance and florescence signals<br />&#61607; High florescent sensitivity<br />&#61607; Generate real time result report in Excel format<br />&#61607; Dynamically display the curve for each well<br />&#61607; Ability to optimize the gain of plate reader for different assay conditions<br />&#61607; Software for selecting measurement parameters and viewing data with a software utility for creating/customizing plate definitions and control via MS Excel<br />&#61607; Calibration devices and software<br />&#61607; Able to complete periodic quality control (preventive maintenance and calibration<br />&#61607; Minimum of 1 Year Warranty</p>
<p>&#61607; Indicate if any maintenance or service plan(s) are necessary and/or available after expiration of Manufacturers' Warranty</p>

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for Purchase, Integration, Implementation and Potential Hosting for a Commercial Item Acquisition System
<SOLNBR>NRC-HQ-11-R-09-0013
<RESPDATE>052711
<CONTACT>Dominique Malone, Phone 3014923613, Email Dominique.Malone@nrc.gov - Joseph Widdup, Contracting Officer/Branch Chief, Email Joseph.Widdup@nrc.gov
<DESC>A. General Information
<p>This is a source sought notice. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting market research to determine the availability of responsible entities that can provide a commercial item acquisitions system (hereafter referred to simply as "acquisitions system"), and the implementation, integration, and hosting of that acquisition system.</p>
<p>The intent of this sources sought notice is gather information to support NRC's market research to identify sources to support informed decisions regarding whether some form of small business set-aside may be appropriate to procure for the required acquisition system and related services. However, the NRC encourages responses from all large and small business interested sources. Small businesses under the NAICS code identified in this notice are highly encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>B. Background<br />NRC has implemented a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product, CGI's Momentum&reg; (hereafter referred to as "Momentum&reg;") for its Core Financial System (CFS), known at the NRC as the FAIMIS CFS. The FAIMIS CFS includes the following modules: Budget Execution, Purchasing, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Purchase Card, General Ledger, Travel Accounting, Fixed Assets, License Fee Billing, and Cost Accounting.</p>
<p>On December 28, 2010, NRC issued Solicitation No. NRC-HQ-11-R-09-0013 for the purchase of commercial item acquisitions system licenses, and the implementation and integration of the acquisition system into CGI's Momentum&reg; federal financial management solution, NRC's FAIMIS CFS. In the solicitation, the NRC required that offerors host their acquisitions system at DOI/NBC with the NRC's CFS located in Denver, CO. Additionally, the solicitation required that the Contractor work with the hosting entity, DOI/NBC, in support of the transition from the NRC to the hosting facility. The solicitation closed on February 21, 2011.</p>
<p><br />On April 27, 2011, NRC was informed that the anticipated hosting site for the acquisition system, DOI/NBC, may not host NRC's current FAIMIS CFS past Oct. 2012). That impacted the acquisition system solicitation because NRC then became faced with the need to identify alternative hosting solution(s) for both the FAIMIS CFS as well as the yet-to-be-procured acquisition system.</p>
<p>C. Objective</p>
<p>NRC's inability to utilize DOI/NBC to host its FAIMIS CFS and its future acquisition system into the future requires additional market research to determine what sources have the capability to provide the products and services required, now to include hosting services. NRC will also use responses and analysis related to this sources sought notice in conjunction with other market research conducted by the NRC to make a determination regarding whether a small business set-aside is appropriate for the acquisition system and related services, including hosting requirements.</p>
<p>D. Solicitation</p>
<p>The solicitation and all subsequent amendments are located on Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-HQ-11-R-09-0013 /listing.html.<br /><br />D.1 Anticipated Amendment to the Solicitation <br /><br />&bull; To NRC is no longer "requiring" that firms host their acquisition system at the&nbsp; Department of Interior/National Business Center (DOI/NBC).<br />&bull; Hosting location for NRC's acquisition system has not been determined<br />&bull; Reporting requirements associated with NRC's FAIMIS Core Financial System (CFS) data warehouse will be deleted from the PWS</p>
<p>Optional Functionality<br />&bull; Data warehouse requirements may become optional<br />&bull; Advanced Procurement Process <br />&bull; Grants Functionality<br />&bull; Requirements to support Department of Energy (DOE) Laboratory Agreements and Interagency Agreements</p>
<p>E. Period of Performance <br />Acquisition System Release 1: October 2013 (FY 14); Release 2: March 2014 (FY 14). Refer to PWS for descriptions of releases.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitation and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate ageny protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountablility Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filling a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing for urgent and compelling reasons or it is determined in writing to be best in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protest must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475. 3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<CONTACT>Debbie Tye, Agricultural Marketing Specialist, Phone 816-926-2557, Email deborah.tye@kcc.usda.gov
<DESC>With the implementation of the Web-Based Supply Chain Management (WBSCM) system for the procurement of supplies used for international food assistance programs administered by U.S. Agency for International Development and USDA-Foreign Agriculture Service, the Government will be using a different contract numbering system for each contract awarded. Previously, each contract was identified by a nine character alpha-numeric, such as "VEP212345", "VEPD12345", "VEPE12345", or VEPK12345". This identified the particular contract action by the Government and, when applicable, this was the contract number that was required to be printed on the packaging pursuant to the marking specifications provided in the pertinent Commodity Requirements Document. In addition, this was the contract identifier for the Government and Contractor for contract administration purposes.
<p>Under WBSCM, the Government will be using the Purchase Order (P.O.) number created by WBSCM as the contract number in order to identify contracting actions. The Purchase Order number is a ten digit number that begins with "42" and is followed by eight additional digits, such as "4200000001". When the contract number is required to be printed on packaging, Contractors should use the Purchase Order number in place of the "VEP2123456", "VEPD123456", "VEPE123456", or VEPK123456" contract numbering type previously used. In addition, Contractors should refer to the P.O. number and the specific line item number in the P.O. when communicating with the Government on contract administration matters. Future solicitation language will also clarify this change.</p>
<p>As further clarification, Purchase Orders issued through WBSCM will contain not only the contract award information, but, also the shipping instructions that had previously been provided in the Notice to Deliver. As a result, there will be no issuance of Notices to Deliver in WBSCM. Please refer to Master Solicitation for Commodity Procurements Part 3, Section A.8 and A.9(b)(ii).</p>
<p>Questions regarding this notice should be directed to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative identified in your Purchase Order.</p>

In addition, this was the contract identifier for the Government and Contractor for contract administration purposes.
<p>Under WBSCM, the Government will be using the Purchase Order (P.O.) number created by WBSCM as the contract number in order to identify contracting actions. The Purchase Order number is a ten digit number that begins with "42" and is followed by eight additional digits, such as "4200000001". When the contract number is required to be printed on packaging, Contractors should use the Purchase Order number in place of the "VEP2123456", "VEPD123456", "VEPE123456", or VEPK123456" contract numbering type previously used. In addition, Contractors should refer to the P.O. number and the specific line item number in the P.O. when communicating with the Government on contract administration matters. Future solicitation language will also clarify this change.</p>
<p>As further clarification, Purchase Orders issued through WBSCM will contain not only the contract award information, but, also the shipping instructions that had previously been provided in the Notice to Deliver. As a result, there will be no issuance of Notices to Deliver in WBSCM. Please refer to Master Solicitation for Commodity Procurements Part 3, Section A.8 and A.9(b)(ii).</p>

<SUBJECT>Dual Band Radar (DBR) Volume Search Radar (VSR) Array Radome Development Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>N0002411RXXXX
<ARCHDATE>07312011
<CONTACT>
<DESC>PURPOSE: The PEO IWS 2.0 Above Water Sensors Program Office is seeking information from industry relating to its need to develop a radome solution to fit the large previously developed S-Band VSR phased array radar to be installed onboard a Navy Aircraft Carrier.  IWS 2.0 is primarily interested in companies with proven solutions (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7+) that can be produced immediately.

BACKGROUND:   A critical item necessary for the successful deployment and function of the VSR portion of the DBR is a radome that protects the phased array antenna from the marine environment, while minimally impacting performance.
PEO IWS 2.0 seeks to identify a new radome design for the purpose of improving radar system performance.
   The intent of this RFI is to gather information from industry to determine potential sources for the design and development of an alternative radome solution for the S-Band VSR shipboard phased array radar.

INFORMATION REQUESTED:  The following information requested is to be submitted by all interested parties with relevant experience and capabilities pertaining to S-Band Array Radomes.

1. The radome is for a large (approximately 13 foot by 13 foot) S-Band phased array antenna for future Navy carriers.
2. Performance parameters will be provided upon request and include, but are not limited to
  a. Operational frequency band
  b. RF transmission loss (in-band and out-of-band)
  c.
 Polarization match
  d. Antenna scan volume impact
  e. Peak and average power handling/incident power (both in active window region and along radome edge)
  f. Transmission amplitude and phase variation and transmission uniformity
  g. Thermal losses
  h. Radar cross section (Note - This is likely to be removed as a requirement)
  i. Environmental coating emissivity
  j. Ice inhibition
  k. Surface temperature monitoring 
  l. Ice load survival
  m. Weight
  n. Edge treatments/transition to ship structure/mounting interface
  o. Vibration
  p. Load bearing/shock
  q. Out of plane deflection
  r. Shear deflection
  s. Overpressure conditions (due to gun blast, nuclear blast, etc)
  t.
 Thermal expansion/contraction
  u. Storage and operating temperature
  v. Solar radiation
  w. Humidity
  x. Precipitation (rain and hail)
  y. Wind, salt spray, wave slap
  z. Electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic vulnerability                                                                                                           
3. Radome concept submissions must include analysis, performance predictions, and any characterization or measurements to demonstrate performance parameters.
4. Since the radome is part of an integrated system with the antenna, performance parameters must be met for the integrated radome-antenna system. Therefore, all submissions should include methodology to ensure that electrical and mechanical performances are met for the integrated system and radome-antenna interactions/interfacing is taken into account.
5.
 Submissions should include vendor electrical and mechanical capability and experience in the areas of 
  a. Antenna/phased array design, analysis, prototyping, characterization and testing
  b. Radome design, analysis, prototyping, characterization and testing

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.<br />(n) Title.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the CCR database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Clause)<br /><br />FAR 52.252-2 - CLAUSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<br />This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Electrocautery Supplies. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project. </strong><br />The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong><br /><br />The major facilities in the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, and Europe include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Regional Medical Command, Heidleberg, GE, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath. <br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg Prime Vendor for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens&amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's Prime vendor program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting Incentive Agreement (IA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is August 2011. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise after consideration of technical requirements, clinical and pricing factors. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically acceptable products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Cora Toledo, Clinical Analyst, Corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Electrocautery Supplies. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,950,754.50. This forecast is based on Medical Product Data Base (MEDPDB) usage data over 12-months of recent usage. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top twenty (20) lines items of the total three hundred and four (304) line items, account for 75% ($1, 472,722.29) of the total volume in sales ($1,950,754.50) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the technical/company requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 20 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFAIQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Cora Toledo, Clinical Analyst, Corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil. </strong>The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFAIQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by the Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by a Designated Senior Clinician (DSC) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO AOR. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/ company requirements outlined below. The five (5) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement:<br />1. Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Electrocautery Supplies products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below are designed to be easy to use, sterile, latex free/safe, disposable and/ or reusable, and offer monopolar and/ or bipolar output.<br />a.</p>
<p>REQUIRED ITEMS<br />PAD GROUNDING ADULT ADHESIVE SPLIT DISPOSABLE with CORD<br />PENCIL CAUTERY CORDLESS DISPOSABLE FINE HI-TEMP STERILE<br />PENCIL CAUTERY HAND CONTROL ROCKER NEEDLE TIP W/HOLSTER DISPOSABLE STERILE with CORD<br />ELECTRODE CAUTERY BLADE 6.5INL DISPOSABLE STERILE<br />ELECTRODE CAUTERY NEEDLE 1.0INL DISPOSABLE<br />ELECTRODE LAPAROSCOPY MONOPOLAR DISPOSABLE L-HOOK WIRE 5MM DIA PTFE COATED STERILE<br />CAUTERY TIP CLEANER<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Electrocautery Supplies</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. Vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (A vendor who does not have a complete product line will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />c. Additionally, the government is seeking full body gel grounding pads. <strong>Failure to have a full body gel grounding pad will not eliminate a vendor from participating in the standardization effort. Vendor must identify whether they can supply full body gel grounding pads. </strong><br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Electrocautery Supplies product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. A vendor without a DAPA number or who has not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Electrocautery Supplies or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. A vendor whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who has not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />(Note: a vendor who fails to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendor MUST provide Electrocautery products that are approved for use by ASA Standards, Guidelines and Policies in all clinical settings, and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Phase II Plan - Selection Process</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Selection Process <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. </strong>Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned. Two (2) samples of each specific disposable product in the sizes listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation, except for Naval Medical Center San Diego, Naval Hospital Bremerton, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, and Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton that will each require four (4) samples of each product in the sizes listed below.</p>
<p>Item to Send Number Each to send per MTF Size Item Description<br />Grounding Pads 2 Adult PAD GROUNDING ADULT ADHESIVE SPLIT DISPOSABLE WITH CORD <br />Cautery Pencil 2 N/A PENCIL CAUTERY HAND CONTROL ROCKER NEEDLE TIP DISPOSABLE/ STERILE W/CORD AND HOLSTER <br />Cautery Pencil 2 N/A ELECTRODE CAUTERY NEEDLE 1.0INL DISPOSABLE</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate the Electrocautery Supplies product samples from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a clinical/patient care setting. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly unacceptable, three (3)- Partially unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a target threshold of 4.0 as the clinically preferred threshold of products for standardization. Vendors scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those Vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately seventeen (17) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: <br />1. The cautery pencil is easily held and used by either hand. ( Non slip grip provides improved control and efficiency) (Clinician Efficiency of Care/ Patient Safety - NPSG 07.0201), OSHA 1910.132 ( c) (Patient and Healthcare Provider Safety) Evaluator will hold the non-slip grip cautery pencil in their dominant, gloved hand. Evaluator should be able to easily hold and maneuver the cautery pencil with control and efficiency, throughout the procedure, in order to avoid patient injury. <br />2. Electrode and needle tip are easily loaded and remain in place without adjustment. (World Health Organization 2003, Surgical Care at the District Hospital, 2.3; Health Devices, 1994). OSHA 1910.1030 (Patient and Healthcare Provider Safety). The electrode and needle tip must be easily loaded and will remain in place without adjustment allowing for safe passing of sharps to prevent injuries in operating rooms. <br />3. Length of cord for pencil and grounding pad is adequate for general procedures. (World Health Organization 2003, Surgical Care at the District Hospital, 2.3; Health Devices, 1994). OSHA 1910.333 (a) (Patient and Healthcare Worker Safety.) Cords will comfortably reach the operative site and minimize the risk of tripping or contamination of the surgical field. Cord length should be approximately 4 to 10 feet in length, long enough to provide adequate length of cord that is not cumbersome while doing the procedure.<br />4. All connectors on pad, pencils, and cords are secure. ( AORN Standards and Recommended Practices for Perioperative Nursing III; 2011; Health Devices, 1994). OSHA 1910.333, 1926.416 (Patient and Healthcare Provider Safety) Direct observation and manipulation of the instrument will help ensure that components are operationally intact and secure connectors help prevent shock or other injuries from either direct or indirect electrical contacts, when work is performed.<br />5. Pad conforms to patient's anatomy for maximum safety and is adequately pre-gelled. (ECRI Institute Health Devices, Jan 1980) (Patient Safety) OSHA 1910.132 ( c) (Patient and Healthcare Provider Safety) Adequately pre-gelled pad will reduce the risk of injury, fight pad burns and increase patient safety.<br />6. The non-conductive holster is easily secured to the sterile field. (World Health Organization 2003, Surgical Care at the District Hospital, 2.3; Health Devices, 1994; ECRI Los Angeles Fire Marshall). (Patient and Healthcare Provider Safety) When not in use, the cautery pencil should be placed in a clean, dry, non-conductive holster. This will prevent inadvertent activation of the cautery pencil that can cause fire.<br />7. Packaging is clearly marked as to content and allows for safe delivery to the sterile field. Global Harmonization Task Force SG1/N020R5 (Medical Device Safety and Patient Safety), Patient Safety and Infection Prevention- NPSG 07.02.01 Packaging must be easy to open and allows safe delivery to the sterile field to prevent the risk of contamination. <br />8. Packaging of the grounding pad is easily identifiable by color code with the size of the pad that is <br />specific for adult, pediatric, and neonate. (Patient and Healthcare Provider Safety) OSHA <br />1910.333, 1910.132. AORN Standards and Recommended Practices for Perioperative Nursing <br />2010. Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. ANSI/AAMI HF18:2001. <br />Electrosurgery checklist. Operating Room Risk Management. 2007; 2 (Surgery 10) ECRI Institute. The grounding pad packaging easily identifies the color coded product with the correct size and quickly visualizes the clearly marked expiration date and lot number. Using an appropriate sized grounding pad reduces the concentration of current and minimizes the potential for electrosurgical injuries.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis</p>
<p>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements Evaluation, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendors will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing must be received at the MMESO Pacific by 5:00 PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Transportation Security Administration<br />1900 Oracle Way, Suite 400 - NEDCTP<br />Reston, VA 20598 - 6105</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program (NEDCTP) intends to procure used luggage/baggage to be used by the NEDCTP proprietary canine teams at multiple locations throughout the continental United States (CONUS).</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NEDCTP exists to deter and detect the introduction of explosives into the transportation system. Explosives detection canine teams are a proven reliable resource to detect explosives and are key components in a balanced counter-sabotage program. The canine teams are acclimated to the unique characteristics of the airport and mass transit systems and are well versed in searching many types of aircraft, mass transit systems, light rail and subways. The TSA-certified explosives detection canine teams combine excellent mobility with reliable detection rates. Through this procurement, TSA seeks to purchase used luggage/baggage with contents for TSA federal canine teams deployed across the continental United States. TSA regulates airports and airlines; therefore, it would be a conflict of interest to solicit donations of used luggage/baggage from either of these entities.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The NEDCTP requires a variety of soft-sided and hard-sided used luggage/baggage with contents that will be shipped on a quarterly basis to multiple CONUS locations. This requirement is for a three (3) year period of performance. During this period of performance, NEDCTP will require a minimum of 310 pieces of used luggage/baggage and a maximum of 25,920 pieces of used luggage/baggage. Based on the projected growth of the program, an increase in the quantity of used luggage is anticipated in the second and third years of the period of performance.</p>
<p>4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/TASKS</p>
<p>The Contractor(s) shall provide soft-sided and hard-sided case used luggage/baggage in a variety of sizes meeting the requirements listed below:</p>
<p>a) Used luggage/baggage must be in good working order with working zippers, undamaged handles and wheels where applicable.</p>
<p>b) Damaged used luggage/baggage where the outer shell is cracked, torn or punctured will not be accepted. However, an exception will be made for the damage to the interior lining or compartments of the used luggage. Cosmetic imperfections such as scuffs, scrapes or discoloration will be accepted.</p>
<p>c) Each piece of used luggage/baggage shall contain five (5) used but not soiled articles of clothing.</p>
<p>d) Each piece of used luggage/baggage shall contain three (3) used toiletry items that would fit in a standard shaving kit or toiletry bag with dimensions of approximately 10.5" x 6.5" x 5". Used toiletry items must be in good condition with no leaking product, dents, ill-fitting caps or cracks. Used toiletry items must be chosen from the following list of items: deodorant, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, facial cleanser, perfume, shaving cream, after shave, wet wipes, hair spray, gel, mousse, makeup, contact lens solution, over-the-counter medicines, anti-bacterial spray, nail polish and suntan lotion.</p>
<p>e) Each used luggage shipment shall consist of an assortment of used luggage/baggage sizes (example of sizes to include: pullman, weekender/overnighter, full size and carry-on luggage). TSA will not accept a shipment containing all the same sized luggage. <br />Contractor(s) will ship used luggage/baggage with contents meeting the technical requirements listed above. Contractor(s) will be responsible for all shipping and handling costs (these costs shall be included in pricing). Delivery instructions will be provided by TSA when delivery orders are placed. <br /><br />Estimated Quantities</p>
<p>Over the three (3) year period of performance, the minimum quantity of used luggage/baggage required is 310 pieces and the maximum quantity required is estimated to be 25,920 pieces.</p>
<p>5. DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>Initial Delivery Order</p>
<p>For the initial delivery order of 1,320 pieces of used luggage, the Government anticipates that the awarded Contractor(s) will each provide a minimum of 310 pieces of luggage shipped to multiple CONUS locations. Shipping locations and points of contact will be provided by TSA at the time of the delivery order award. Contractor(s) will ship the initial delivery order within 15 days of delivery order award. Contractor(s) shall provide a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report for each shipment.</p>
<p>Recurring Delivery Orders</p>
<p>Contractor(s) will provide by delivery order, quarterly shipments of a minimum of 310 pieces of used luggage/baggage with contents to multiple CONUS locations. The Contractor(s) shall also provide additional emergency deliveries upon request by TSA. Shipping locations and points of contact will be provided by TSA within five days of delivery order award. Contractor(s) shall ship used luggage/baggage within 30 days of delivery order award. Contractor(s) shall provide a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report for all shipments.</p>
<p>Information regarding the required quantities of used luggage will be provided in the RFP for each delivery order. Dates for delivery and delivery locations will be indicated on individual delivery orders. Offers must be submitted on the basis of f.o.b. destination only.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance</p>
<p>Legal title to the goods (ownership) transfers from the Contractor to the Government at the time of acceptance of quality, quantity and the condition of tendered supplies. Acceptance is the act of an unauthorized Government agent which formally determines that the supplies submitted by a Contractor satisfactorily discharge the Contractor's duty of performance under the delivery order.</p>
<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance for the IDIQ contracts will be one 12-month base period with two 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>7. GOVERNMENT POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government Points of Contact will be determined at the time of award.</p>
<p>SECTION B. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES</p>
<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated as Attachment 2 to this solicitation:</p>
<p>Incorporated by reference: <br />52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items<br />52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items</p>
<p>Incorporated by full text:<br />52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items<br />52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items</p>
<p>SECTION C. ORDERING PROCEDURES</p>
<p>TSA anticipates placing orders through delivery orders. The delivery orders will be administered by the TSA Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued to the IDIQ awardees on a periodic basis. The Contractor shall also provide emergency deliveries upon request by the TSA COTR. The Government reserves the right to place oral orders in accordance with ordering procedures outlined in FAR 16.505 as appropriate.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 16.505(b), the Contracting Officer will ensure that all awardees receive a fair opportunity to compete for future delivery orders. When there is a requirement for a delivery order to be fulfilled, the Government will issue a RFP to the awardees. A response time will be designated in the RFP. The Government will review all timely and complete responses and award the delivery order to the awardee(s) that represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>For delivery orders, the basis of award for each task order will be stated in the RFP. Delivery order proposals will be evaluated on the basis of either best value trade-off or a best value lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA). When evaluating proposals based on trade-off, the non-price evaluation factors of past performance and technical approach, when combined, will be considered to be equal in importance to price in determining the best value to the Government. When evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the timeliness of previous deliveries and the quality and adherence to the technical requirements listed in the RFP.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make a direct award to any vendor if one of the statutory exceptions at FAR 16.505(b) applies to the situation. Each awardee's past performance will continuously be recorded and evaluated for delivery orders and will be considered in the competition of future orders.</p>
<p>SECTION D. ADDITIONAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1. Funding</p>
<p>This IDIQ does not obligate any funds nor authorize any deliveries. The Government is obligated only to the extent of funds obligated on authorized delivery orders issued under the IDIQ awards. The firm-fixed price per unit is based on a breakdown of all costs and delivery charges to NEDCTP locations throughout CONUS.</p>
<p>2. Accounting and Appropriation Data</p>
<p>Accounting and appropriation data will be provided at the delivery order level.</p>
<p>3. Post Award Conference</p>
<p>The Contractor(s) shall attend a Post Award Conference with the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist and COTR at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. The Post Award Conference will cover the terms and conditions of the IDIQ, partnering and working relationships, contract administration and other administrative concerns. The date of the Post Award Conference will be no later than two (2) weeks after date of the multiple IDIQ contract awards. The Contractor(s) will be contacted by the Contract Specialist to coordinate the Post Award Conference.</p>
<p>4. Contracting Officer</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make any changes, approve any changes in the requirements of this contract, issue orders, obligate funds and authorize the expenditure of funds, and notwithstanding any term contained elsewhere in this contract, such authority remains vested solely in the Contracting Officer. (For further information, the Contracting Officer is a federal government employee who is specifically authorized and appointed in writing under specified agency procedures and granted the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.) In the event, the Contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>5. Contracting Officer's Technical Representative</p>
<p>The principle role of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) is to support the Contracting Officer in managing the contract. This is done through furnishing technical direction within the confines of the contract, monitoring performance, ensuring requirements are met within the terms of the contract, and maintaining a strong relationship with the Contracting Officer. As a team, the Contracting Officer and COTR must ensure that program requirements are clearly communicated and that the agreement is performed to meet them.</p>
<p>6. Disclosure of Information</p>

Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personally-identifiable information must be clearly marked.</p>
<p>Any information made available to the Contractor(s) by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the requirements of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>In performance of this contract, the Contractor(s) assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and information and must ensure that all work performed by its Subcontractor(s) shall be under the supervision of the Contractor(s) or employees of the Contractor(s).</p>
<p>7. Publicity and Dissemination of Contract Information</p>
<p>Publicity releases or commercial advertising in connection with or referring to this contract or effort shall not be made by the Contractor(s) unless prior written approval has been received from the Contracting Officer. The Contractor(s) shall not publish, permit to be published or distribute for public consumption, any information, oral or written, concerning the results or conclusions made pursuant to the performance of this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. Two copies of any material proposed to be published or distributed shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer. A minimum of five full business days' notice is required for requests made in accordance with this provision.</p>
<p>8. Advertising of Award</p>
<p>The contractor shall not refer to contract awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is endorsed or preferred by the Federal Government or is considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services.</p>
<p>9. Major Breach of Safety or Security</p>
<p>(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and compliance with safety standards and practices is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor(s) that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</p>
<p>(b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor(s) that results in compromise of classified information or sensitive security information or sensitive but unclassified information, including contractor proprietary information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.</p>
<p>NOTE: Breach of Security for the purposes of this definition should not be confused with breach of security in screening operations.<br /><br />(c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Contractor(s) shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor(s) shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Contractor(s) shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted.</p>
<p>10. Government Furnished Resources and Information</p>
<p>No portion of this requirement is predicated upon the use of government-furnished equipment unless specifically defined in this document.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Delivery shall be no later than 30 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-51. A redacted copy of the required brand-name justification is included within this announcement.</p>
<p>This is an unrestricted acquisition and the associated NAICS code is 541511 with a size standard of $25,000,000 in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities of less than requested or products other than those requested will be deemed technically unacceptable.<br />CLIN Descriptions:</p>
<p>CLIN 001: Citrix XenApp Platinum Edition Maintenance Renewal with Subscription Advantage, P/N: SUBCPSPLPCSAR, QTY: 100 EA. POP: 1 May 2011 through 30 APR 2012. S/N: LA0000928812-31257.</p>
<p>Redacted Justification: Citrix Subscription advantage platform program supports the Government's telecommuting programs that allow employees to manage their work at an alternate work site, such as the employees home, a telecenter, or other location, to accomplish their work in an effective and efficient manner, all which is essential to the mission. No other platform provides the breadth of Citrix's system management function in maintaining the Agency's compliant environment. When compared to other brands offered in the commercial market, the unique features offered by Citrix's platform provide superior data center security against vulnerabilities and comprehensive management of the network. This eliminates application downtime and increased IT administrator productivity, allowing agencies to meet their mission objectives. The Governments operational requirements, interface requirements, and current operation environment cannot be changed or altered to accommodate an alternate product without incurring additional significant cost that will not be recouped through competition.</p>

General Instructions</strong>
<p>1.0 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48. <br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop managed services. This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). The associated contract clauses and statement of work are included with this synopsis/solicitation are provided with this solicitation. <br /><br />All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email to the point of contact listed in this solicitation. All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below: <br /><br />1.1 The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation. The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.<br /><br />1.2 Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. <br /><br />1.3 The proposal packages must be received on the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater then 5MB in size. Such submissions may be excluded. <strong>Proposals shall be submitted to Scott Stallsmith at scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 6, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br /></strong><br />1.4 Proposals submitted after the time and date specified for receipt of the RFP will be considered LATE in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition. <br /><br />1.5 Written requests for clarification may be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at the title of the e-mail must include "URHD QUESTION". The content of a question may be included in a notification or answer to all Offerors, but if so included will not divulge the source of the question. All questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the closing date of the RFP. <strong>All questions need to be submitted to scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 1, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time. <br /></strong><br />1.6 Small Business Subcontracting Plan<br />Each Large Business Offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9 Alt III (July 2010). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Approach information required below, which applies to both large and small businesses. An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.<br /><br />1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing. <br /><br />1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals. <br /><br />1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP). <br /><br /><strong>1.10 Identify in your proposal any particular security restrictions, deliverables, or any other URHD requirements in the SOW or other associated attachments that would restrict implementation of the Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop here in NGA.<br /></strong><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS-United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timely consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns with the USCG as an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of a informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Forman Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternate to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless the contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, DC 20593-0001, FAX:202-475-3904.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />Request for Information<br />SAF/FMP AFFSO <br />Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) <br />Response Deadline: 27 May 2011; 4:00 PM (CDST)<br />42nd Contracting Office<br />Marcus Abram, Contract Specialist; Anthony Sandoval, Contract Specialist; Jacqueline Threat-Tellis, Contracting Officer<br />Maxwell AFB, AL 36112
<p>Purpose: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IAW FAR 15.201(e). This notice is solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this Request For Information (RFI) and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry on establishing sustainment and enhancement activities for the Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) system by gaining knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications (small business, large business, etc.) The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms, and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for possible future acquisitions. Please do not request a copy of a solicitation because one does not exist.</p>
<p>Request for Information/Questions: The Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/ Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) is an Air Force Programming system designed to support development of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President's Budget (PB). FIRST/FSDM maintains an inventory of the Air Force's force structure (organizations, weapon systems and flying hours) and enables the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) to prioritize and program Air Force requirements. It also provides a historical query and analysis capability of 30+ years of Air Force budget data and submissions. It replaces and enhances the legacy Program Data System (PDS).</p>
<p>FIRST/FSDM features a modern system architecture that is hosted on the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) classified integration framework (IF) utilizing the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). FIRST/FSDM is web-based, utilizing the Oracle 11i Application Suite. Cognos Business Intelligence is used for "what-if" analysis, ad hoc reporting, and reports generation. FIRST/FSDM maximizes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and GCSS-AF Services to deliver a system that provides a sustainable flexible, user-friendly information system.</p>
<p>In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information would be useful:</p>
<p>1. Estimated cost of service<br />2. Estimated transition time to provide the service<br />3. Any inputs concerning the NAICS and SBA size standards that should be considered for any potential RFP? <br />4. Recent (last 5 years) experience working with government IT systems. <br />5. Recent (last 5 years) experience in developing an architectural upgrade strategy to maximize performance and Hardware usage.&nbsp;<br />6. Any other aspects that should be considered by the government as it refines the requirement and potentially develops an acquisition strategy?<br />7. What Performance Metrics could be made available to the government related to usage. <br /><br />If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed below. A site survey cannot be accomodated at this time. <br /><br />Responses: This RFI is prepared for planning purposes only and is not restricted to small business. If the government decides to pursue an RFP, portions of your RFI response may be incorporated into the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Sources are discouraged from submitting any information deemed competition-sensitive or proprietary. However, if sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1) RFI responses must include company name, address, at least one designated point of contact, voice, and fax telephone numbers, and an email address.<br /><br />2) Please include your Business Type, i.e., Small, Small disadvantaged, Women-owned, Hub Zone, Service-disabled veteran-owned, 8(a), large business, and etc.<br /><br />3) All responses shall be provided on white paper outlining the company's responses, not to exceed 7 pages, single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 font.</p>
<p>4) All questions and responses to our request for information/questions shall be submitted, via e-mail, to marcus.abrams@maxwell.af.mil; anthony.sandoval@maxwell.af.mil; and jacqueline.threat-tellis@maxwell.af.mil.</p>
<p>After review of the responses to this RFI, the Government may or may not proceed with an acquisition. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any new information related to this RFI.<br /><br />Primary POC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alt POC<br />Name Marcus Abram&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Sandoval <br />Phone # (334) 953-5227&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(334) 953-6170<br />E-mail: marcus.abrams@maxwell.af.mil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:anthony.sandoval@maxwell.af.mil">anthony.sandoval@maxwell.af.mil</a></p>

<DESC>Special Notice Announcement for Compatibility Check with U.S. Army Enablers for Individual Carbine (IC) Competition Weapon Candidates<br><br><br>

The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Picatinny (ACC-PICA), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM SW), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07860-5000, is announcing a Compatibility Check with the U.S. Army enablers for all potential Individual Carbine (IC) Competition weapon candidates. The purpose of this Compatibility Check is to allow all vendors an opportunity to better prepare their proposals for the IC competition. <br><br>
Manufacturers of potential IC weapon candidates are invited to conduct a compatibility check using their own carbines with the U.S. Army enablers.  Compatibility checks will occur over the next couple of months, with an exact schedule to be provided to each vendor at a TBD date upon the conclusion of the registration period.  Contractors will be assigned a schedule on a first-come, first-served basis, for access to the Army enablers. The Compatibility Check will be held at H.P. White Laboratory, Inc., located at 3114 Scarboro Road, Street, MD 21154. The Government will make the following enablers available for use at the H.P. White Laboratory facility:  M9 Bayonet; M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun Systems; M203A2 Grenade Launcher; M320A1 Grenade Launcher; M23 Blank Firing Adaptor; M68 Reflex Sight w/Mount; M150 Rifle Combat Optic; PEQ-15 (Laser/Light); PEQ-15A (Infrared Aiming Laser); AN/PAS-13; Thermal Weapon Sight; and the AN-PSQ-23 (STORM) (Multi-functional laser system). Each vendor will be allotted an initial time period of eight (8) hours and a follow-up time period of four (4) hours (if needed). <br><br>
This is a non-firing Compatibility Check. Therefore, function firing of the various enablers will not be permitted nor will batteries be provided for operation of the devices.  In addition, vendors participating in the Compatibility Check will not be furnished any ammunition, nor will they be allowed to bring their own ammunition to fire their weapons with any of the accessories, to include the Government-provided M320 Grenade Launcher, M203A2 Grenade Launcher or the M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System.  During the Compatibility Check, vendors will have time to check their attachment and detachment methods and to take any necessary measurements needed with the Army enablers. <br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS: Interested vendors must register to participate by contacting Holly Gregg via email, at holly.gregg2@us.army.mil.  The registration shall end ten (10) business days effective from the first day of this posting and will be scheduled on a first come, first-served basis.  After the Registration Period (23 May to 3 June, 2011) has ended, each vendor will be assigned a time slot to conduct their Compatibility check.   The amount of time for the compatibility check will be the same for all vendors.  Vendors are allowed to bring multiple weapons and three (3) representatives total will be enforced due to limited arms room space.  The costs associated with the usage of H.P. Whites facility during the Compatibility Checks will be provided by the Government.  No Government furnished property will be removed from H.P. Whites facility. Full accountability of the Government furnished property provided for this compatibility check will be maintained. <br><br>
NOTE: The Government will not be responsible for any expenses incurred by a vendors decision to participate in the vendor Compatibility Check (e.g., travel and transportation costs, etc.), nor will the Government be responsible for any damages incurred to a vendors weapon systems and/or equipment or injury to participants as a result of the Compatibility Check.  There will be no Government representation during the Compatibility Checks.<br><br><br>

Reminder: Interested vendors must register to participate by contacting Holly Gregg no later than 3 June 2011, via email, at holly.gregg2@us.army.mil.  For all other inquiries, please contact:  The U.S. Army Contracting Command  Picatinny, Maneuver Ammo Center (ACC-PICA-MA), Bldg. 45B, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, Mail Stop:  Bldg. 10B, Attn: Holly Gregg, or at holly.gregg2@us.army.mil. <br><br>
This is a special notice only and is for planning purposes only. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Georgetown University Hospital, 3800 Reservoir Road, N.W., Washington, DC  20007 for a collaboration on a specialized training of clinical fellows for research in psychiatry of complex medical illnesses.  

The Office of the Clinical Director is part of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program (NIMH-DIRP).  The DIRP conducts clinical research designed to expedite the exchange of information between scientists and clinicians so that basic findings can be moved quickly from the laboratory setting to the treatment of patients at the bedside.  Clinical research, including natural history protocols and clinical trials, is of primary importance to the research mission of the NIMH.  The clinical research portion of the program comprises tenured and tenure-track clinical investigators, staff clinicians, and fellows in more than a dozen clinical Branches and free-standing Sections.  There are approximately 120 NIMH protocols, which accounted for approximately 7,000 inpatient days and 7,000 outpatient visits in FY10.  The mission of the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) is to ensure that subjects participating in NIMH protocols receive the highest quality clinical care.  

The proposed acquisition will provide the Office of the Clinical Director with residents specializing in psychosomatic medicine, a subspecialty of general psychiatry, from Georgetown University in a collaboration providing these residents with access to subjects participating in clinical research in the NIH Clinical Center.

Georgetown University Hospital, under the auspices of MedStar Georgetown Medical Center, is a premier medical research institution.  This institution offers future physicians a superior and supportive environment for learning the science of medicine.  In addition, Georgetown Universitys Psychiatry Department offers particular faculty expertise in psychosomatic medicine in areas that supplement researchers at the NIMH.  Georgetown University can provide residents that are trained in psychosomatic medicine.  The University sponsors a new, highly competitive, advanced clinical training program in the area of expertise for its training partners, the NIMH Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Service which is part of the NIMH-DIRP and Washington Hospital Center.  The residents have previously been competitively selected and accepted for this specialized program.  

The training will provide the OCD with specialized services to assist in the provision of care with the following services:

-Assessment, treatment and follow-up of research subjects with psychiatric disorders in conjunction with ongoing studies in other NIH intramural research programs;
-Implementation of diagnostic plans to complement multidisciplinary treatment plans; and 
-Psychotherapeutic intervention for research subjects in inpatient studies.

In addition, this training offers NIMH an opportunity to work with highly skilled clinicians who can contribute to the research mission of the NIH and its Intramural Research Program.  

Georgetown University Hospital has previously worked with NIMH in collaboration on these specialized training programs and is thus the only source available that will satisfy the agencys requirement.

The period of performance is six (6) months from the date of award.  The place of performance is NIH Main Campus located in Bethesda, MD. 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 2:00 PM E.T., June 3, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2080847 on all correspondence.

<CONTACT>Peggy Smith Peggy.L.Smith1@usmc.mil Peggy Smith at Peggy.L.Smith1@usmc.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide responses to industry questions concerning subject pre-solicitation notice.  Accordingly, the following is provided:

Question (1):  Please confirm that the connection point at the tube tip (where the bite valve detaches from the tube) must be compatible with the USMC filter.
Answer (1):  The female connection point on the hydration bladder shall be compatible with the USMC microbiological filter and currently fielded hydration tube.   

Question (2): Can the test method for measuring resistance to static load be provided?
Answer (2):  The bladder filled to capacity shall be laid flat and compressed at the midline with a 20 in round anvil on an Instron test machine with a 1000 lb cell.
 It shall be set at 500 lb cyclic compression. Mechanical valves that restrict the flow of water to the bite valve shall be open during the test. There shall be no damage or leakage after three cycles at a speed of 0.5 in/min. 

Question (3):  Is it possible to pre-certify an alternative Hydration Bladder System as an equivalent?
Answer (3):  Pre-certification of components within the USMC Pack System will not occur.  Request for Equivalent status is the responsibility of the interested party.

Question (4):  Part number 90817 is currently unavailable as a commercial item. Can samples, drawings and technical information be made available so that competitors can properly determine equivalency?
Answer (4):  The government does not maintain control of the drawings or technical information for P/N Camelback 90817 Antidote Mil Spec Low Profile OEM Reservoir 100oz.
   

Question (5):  Is there a performance basis for the minimum puncture force requirement?
Answer (5): The hydration bladder film shall meet a minimum puncture force of 90N when tested to ASTM F1306-90 with a stylus of 3.2mm diameter moving at a velocity of 25mm/min.

Question (6):  Will submission of a single operation integrated twist shut off mechanism be allowed as equivalent?
Answer (6):  No.  The shut off valve shall be a single operation type either by a level or slide pull action.  

Question (7):  By automatically seal, could you verify that this means that the tube must seal automatically when the bite valve is detached from the tube?
Answer (7):  When the male tube connector is detached from the female connection point on the hydration bladder, the female connection point on the hydration bladder shall automatically seal, preventing liquid from leaking from the bladder.
  When the bite valve is detached from the bite valve female connection point and the shut off valve is in the off position, liquid shall not leak out of the bite valve female connection point.  
Note:  If the bite valve is lost or removed, the Marine shall be able to drink liquid directly from the bite valve female connection point by turning the shut off valve to the on position.  To stop the flow of liquid, the Marine will manually turn the shut off valve to the off position.

Question (8):  Will submission of an angled valve be allowed? If so, will an appropriately shortened tube also be allowed?
Answer (8):  No, submission of an angled valve will NOT be allowed.  The Bite Valve shall be one component and be a straight design.
  The tube length shall be a minimum of 100 cm long.


Question (9):   Is it the USMC's intent to have contract award in FY 2011?  Production start Q1, FY12?
Answer (9):  It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded in 4th quarter FY11.  The required delivery schedule will be provided in the Request for Proposal.

Question (10):  Will the contract include production of the entire FILBE system or strictly the backpack?
Answer (10):  The contract will require delivery of complete USMC Pack system as well as associated spares/replacement components.    The USMC Chest Rig, USMC Equipment Pouches independent of the USMC Pack System, USMC Holster, USMC Corpsman Assault Pack, and Individual Water Purification System will not be included in this contract.

Solicitation (Request for Architect - Engineer Qualifications)

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking architecture or architecture/engineering firm (NAICS 541310) capable of the planning and design of newly constructed and renovated hospitals, large outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, health care and biomedical research, and similarly complex healthcare projects.  The  architecture or architecture/engineering firm must be capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, geotechnical investigation and surveying, seismic design for new and existing buildings.  The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Seismic Design Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators. All members should have experience in the planning and design of new hospitals (incorporating the Planetree Patient-Centered Care model), large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, medical research facilities, or similar complex healthcare projects.

Scope:
This project will correct potentially hazardous seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies, as well as consolidate outpatient programs and clinical research into a state of the art treatment facility located at the VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System's Reno campus. The proposed project will accomplish renovation of approximately 90% of Building 1, with the exclusion of the major utility and life safety improvements which were completed within the last 3 years. The proposed project would provide the following upgrades in Building 1 which is approximately 138,007 square feet.

1. Seismic upgrades to reduce/eliminate the possibility of catastrophic failure of the 60+ year old building should a significant seismic event occur.

2. Correct life safety and infrastructure deficiencies.

3. Substantially improve building energy efficiencies.

In addition, this project will construct up to approximately 100,000 square feet of clinical expansion to correct space deficiencies.  The Research Program would also be increased as part of this project.  The following programs will be impacted and will benefit from the proposed project: Mental Health, Dental, Compensation and Pension, Audiology, Patient Admissions and Testing, Surgical Service, Quality Management, Veterans Service Offices, Warehouse, Voluntary Services, Veterans Eligibility Center, Geriatrics and Extended Care, Dietetics, In-patient Kitchen, Morgue, Laboratory and Pathology Services, Research, Surgical Service, Medical Service, Ambulatory Care (Patient Centered Medical Home), OEF/OIF, and Women's Health Clinic. The expansion has been tentatively located at the east side of Building 12. The exact location will be determined after all access and adjacencies have been analyzed by an Architect to determine the ideal location.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, water reduction,  energy efficiency and low energy building  design; additionally, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manuals.  The project will be required to attain a minimum LEED Silver certification.  Renewable and innovative energy systems will be required as part of this project.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems, etc. will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The design will be required to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of equipment schedules, schematics design, design development, and construction documents (both plans and specifications), medical and research equipment planning, site design, and including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines as well as estimates of construction costs and market surveys with each design submittal.

The estimated price range for this construction project is over $100,000,000.  At this time it is anticipated that the renovation will include approximately 90% of Building 1and construction of a clinical addition which may follow the design-bid-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method, to include integrated design and construction.  The base contract for Pre-design, Schematic and Design Development documents will include options for construction documents, construction period services, additional site visits, and other professional services.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the requisite Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures, additionally cost and scope management capabilities will be examined.  In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation per the VA BIM Guide.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  The design for all parts of this project are required to meet all national, state, and local building codes, regulations, and standards as well as all VA design guides and design requirements.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ .  Where conflicts occur between VA standards and model codes, the most stringent requirement shall govern.

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  A market study to include Project Labor Agreements (PLA) and an estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The phases include Schematic Design 1, Schematic Design 2, Design Development 1, Design Development 2, and Construction Documents.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction at time of award.  More design submission requirements can be found in VA Guide PG-18-15.
