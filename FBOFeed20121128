This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.  Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>This is a large purchase for NSN&nbsp; 4720-01-454-6168. Specifications, drawings or standards are not available from the Government. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only offers based on approved sources under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) 1. Current approved manufacturers are&nbsp;DESIGNED METAL CONNECTIONS, INC.&nbsp;&nbsp; (14798)&nbsp;&nbsp; P/N&nbsp; 147-00052-7&nbsp;and THE BOEING COMPANY&nbsp;&nbsp; (82918)&nbsp;&nbsp; P/N&nbsp; 10-20051-565&nbsp;. This solicitation opens on&nbsp;&nbsp;12/14/12&nbsp;and closes 1/14/13. This requirement is for a quantity of 14 each. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based on combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: Unrestricted.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br /><br />ITEM DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />&nbsp; HOSE KIT, FUEL.<br />&nbsp; *** NO (ARP) ALTERNATE RELEASE PROCEDURE***<br />&nbsp; NOTE: THIS IS A RESTRICTED SOURCE ITEM AND<br />&nbsp; REQUIRES ENGINEERING SOURCE APPROVAL BY THE<br />&nbsp; GOVERNMENT DESIGN CONTROL ACTIVITY.<br />&nbsp; THIS ITEM HAS TECHNICAL DATA THAT IS SUBJECT TO<br />&nbsp; EXPORT CONTROL<br />&nbsp; REGULATIONS, OR THE ITEM HAS NO TECHNICAL DATA BUT<br />&nbsp; IT IS LISTED ON THE<br />&nbsp; UNITED STATES MUNITIONS LIST (USML) OR THE<br />&nbsp; COMMERCE CONTROL LIST (CCL),<br />&nbsp; AND IT IS THEREFORE CONTROLLED FOR EXPORT BY THE<br />&nbsp; INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC<br />&nbsp; IN ARMS REGULATION (ITAR) OR EXPORT ADMINISTRATION<br />&nbsp; REGULATION (EAR).<br />&nbsp; (SEE DFARS CLAUSE 252.204-7008.)<br />&nbsp; DISTRIBUTION OF THE TECHNICAL DATA AND ELIGIBILITY<br />&nbsp; FOR AWARD ARE LIMITED<br />&nbsp; TO THOSE SUPPLIERS QUALIFIED THROUGH JCP<br />&nbsp; CERTIFICATION, OR TO THOSE<br />&nbsp; LICENSED BY EITHER THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE OR<br />&nbsp; COMMERCE; OR TO FOREIGN<br />&nbsp; SUPPLIERS PURSUANT TO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.<br />&nbsp; TO APPLY FOR JCP CERTIFICATION, COMPLETE DD FORM<br />&nbsp; 2345, "MILITARY<br />&nbsp; CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT," FORM IS<br />&nbsp; AVAILABLE AT THE WORLD WIDE<br />&nbsp; WEB ADDRESS:<br />&nbsp; HTTP://WWW.LOGISTICSINFORMATIONSERVICE.DLA.MIL/JCP<br />&nbsp; OR BY WRITING TO:<br />&nbsp; UNITED STATES/CANADA JOINT CERTIFICATION OFFICE<br />&nbsp; DLA LOGISTICS INFORMATION SERVICE<br />&nbsp; FEDERAL CENTER<br />&nbsp; 74 WASHINGTON AVE., NORTH<br />&nbsp; BATTLE CREEK, MI 49017-3084<br />&nbsp; TO MANUFACTURE THIS ITEM, NON-JCP CERTIFIED<br />&nbsp; SUPPLIERS MUST SUBMIT A<br />&nbsp; CURRENT MANUFACTURING LICENSE AGREEMENT, TECHNICAL<br />&nbsp; ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT,<br />&nbsp; DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT OR OFF-SHORE PROCUREMENT<br />&nbsp; AGREEMENT APPROVED BY<br />&nbsp; THE DIRECTORATE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS WITH THE<br />&nbsp; OFFER, UNLESS AN<br />&nbsp; EXEMPTION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ITAR SECTION,<br />&nbsp; 125.4 "EXEMPTIONS OF<br />&nbsp; GENERAL APPLICABILITY," AND/OR EAR PART 740 ARE<br />&nbsp; APPLICABLE.<br />&nbsp; NON-JCP CERTIFIED SUPPLIERS SEEKING EXPORT<br />&nbsp; CONTROLLED TECHNICAL DATA ARE<br />&nbsp; REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE CONTRACTING OFFICER WITH<br />&nbsp; AN APPLICABLE AGREEMENT<br />&nbsp; OR IDENTIFY WHICH ITAR/EAR EXEMPTION APPLIES TO<br />&nbsp; RECEIVE A COPY OF THE<br />&nbsp; EXPORT CONTROLLED TECHNICAL DATA.<br />&nbsp; NOTE: SUPPLIERS ARE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY<br />&nbsp; SUB-CONTRACTORS AT TIME OF<br />&nbsp; QUOTING IF KNOWN.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 127 each to be shipped to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA 17070-5001. FOB destination and inspection at destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at <a href="http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp"><span>http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp</span></a><span> <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">after the issue date of 12/14/2012.</span> Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, and Ability One.. The required delivery is 200 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. </em></strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;Reverse Auction:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;The Contracting officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offers, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;E-Mail Proposals:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposals shall not be transmitted directly to the Contracting Officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC) has a requirement for Power & Privilege: Race Workshops. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from S.L. Robbins and Associates on a sole source basis. The primary objective of the work to be performed is to examine issues of power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion and race and how they affect everyone, regardless of color, at Goddard. The workshop will enable participants to be more aware of and skillful at managing discrepancies related to race, power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion as they carry out their functional supervisory and leadership duties across the Center. It will also increase their capacity to recognize and discuss dynamics of race, power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion within their functional organizations and thus create opportunities for improving understanding, problem solving, decision-making, and teamwork. S.L. Robbins & Associates has successfully developed and previously delivered a Race, Power, and Privilege workshop module for other Goddard Organizations. The workshops design and facilitation effectively enabled participants, regardless of race, to examine and discuss the systemic nature of racial privilege and its impact on themselves and at Goddard. Several Goddard organizations, members of the Centers Management Council and individuals attended the previous S.L. Robbins and Associates workshop. OHCM, EEO and the Diversity Special Assistant (supported by Goddard Management) have determined that all supervisors and influence leaders need to revive the same training in order for the center to fully accomplish the goals of its future planning initiative. The previously delivered workshop required has been modified in order to highlight Goddard specific context, but the foundations of the workshop remain in their entirety. S.L. Robbins & Associates has extensive, unique experience in working with the organizational cultures at the GSFC. They have proven skills and expertise in creating the necessary transformative experience in this culture for brining the issue of racism from a cognitive, conceptual and analytical level to an effective, operational and solution-oriented level. S.L. Robbins & Associates is uniquely qualified to conduct a training workshop similar to the one found to be so effective in the Goddard culture previously and to apply it to the specific needs of OHCM, EEO and the Special Assistant for Diversity. For this workshop to enable OHCM to remain a leading voice in the Centers conservation about race, power, privilege, diversity and inclusion and to fulfill its obligations to the Centers diversity strategy, S.L. Robbins is the only responsible source. No other potential source that possesses the experience, skills, and knowledge necessary to successfully meet the Office of Human Capital Management (OHCM) requirements for this workshop are known to exist. The information provided in the workshop is copyrighted material. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501 (a)(1)(ii). This program was designed based on NASA meeting its strategic goals.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note B.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Ann Arbor Healthcare System, located in Ann Arbor, MI. An Invitation for Bid will be issued on or about March 7, 2012 for construction project 506-310 "Expand East Parking Structure" at the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105. This announcement is a total set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. The VA is seeking a qualified Contractor to furnish all labor, materials, tools, equipment, permits, and supervision necessary to accomplish the work as provided for in the Contract documents, Plans and Specifications, summary of which is provided below:
The EPS Expansion project 506-310 consists of a 4-level horizontal expansion to the north side of the existing East Parking Structure to serve visitors and staff for a net gain of 307 parking spaces. The horizontal expansion to the East Parking Structure shall extend approximately 144 feet north of the existing structure by the same width as the existing structure. The expansion includes three supported levels and a grade level that aligns vertically with the existing floors. Access to all levels shall be provided through the existing ramping system. The expansion structure bays shall align with the 3 bays of the existing structure allowing a convenient extension of the traffic flow along the west and middle bays. The east bay traffic cannot flow straight into the expansion structure due to the existing shear walls along the north elevation that shall remain in place at the lower 3 levels for structural support. At the roof, level where the shear wall is not needed, the traffic flow in the east bay will continue straight north into the expansion structure to provide more efficient traffic flow and to gain additional parking spaces. See all project drawings and specifications for phasing, construction requirements and specific details.

Completion Time: 300-calender days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. Prior to commencing work, the contractor receiving award shall provide proof that an OSHA certified "competent person" (CP) (29 CFR 1926.20(b) (2) with 30-hour OSHA certification will maintain a presence at the work site whenever the general or subcontractors are present. All employees of general contractor or subcontractors on site shall have the 10-hour OSHA certified Construction Safety course.

This construction project is set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms (SDVOSB).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) intends to award a fixed price contract to purchase 12 Mobile Magnetic Particle Units (MMPU), NIIN 01-587-2347, P/N MP-2000S-NAVY, along with a limited logistics package to power the Bench Top Magnetic Particle Units currently aboard CVNs and to replace the stand alone units aboard LHD/LHAs. The 2,000 amp AC or Half Wave-DC (HWDC) item provides for moderate powered Magnetic Particle Inspections (MPI). The unit is used for detection of surface and near surface flaws, and also performs AC demagnetization. The limited ILS package being procured will include a Navy Work Package (WP) technical manual, Maintenance Requirements Card, Engineering Drawings for Provisioning (EDFP) and Hazardous Materials Report including Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on a sole source basis with Test Systems International, Inc. (TSI).
<p>The Government plans to procure 12 MMPUs along with a limited logistics package over the life of the contract. In July 2010, in response to multiple Broad Arrow (BA) messages from the Fleet for obsolete legacy assets, NAVAIR completed an Urgent Need Sole Source procurement of ten units from TSI as an immediate stop gap solution. The current procurement for twelve units is to replace the remainder of the Fleet's inventory of legacy assets. The emergency buy did not include a logistics package, so the Fleet does not have logistics support in place for the existing ten units. soliciting this requirement by full and open competition is not effective as TSI is the only known source with the knowledge and capability to provide a unit that has proven availability to demonstrate reliability and sustainability in a fleet environment without a disruption in schedule or degradation of performance. NAWCADLKE intends to award this contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (C)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.</p>

<SOLNBR>SOL-CI-12-00072
<RESPDATE>101812
<ARCHDATE>11172012
<CONTACT>Kimberly Loesch

<a href="mailto:Loesch.Kimberly@epa.gov">loesch.kimberly@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The US EPA intends to procure on a sole source basis a ThermoFisher Scientific QExactive Benchtop Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (MS), Accela UHPLC system from THERMO ELECTRON NORTH AMERICA LLC.  for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL).  This system shall include electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources, Xcalibur software, gas phase chromatography interface, and all software and accessories necessary to detect and analyze mass spectra from a wide range of endogenous metabolites (i.e., biochemicals) present in a variety of biomatrices (e.g., biofluids, tissues, etc.) with a high degree of resolution, accuracy, and sensitivity.  EPA intends to use the GSA Schedule of ThermoFisher GS-24F-0026L for the main unit and intends to add the following non-schedule items to the resultant order as these items are to be integrated into the main unit in order to meet the need s of the Agency.  These open market items include: Kit, Column SW 10Port VLV, A/S, RoH;  Column Oven 300;  CTC Mount;  Heat Exchanger Low Volume;  Generator, Nitrogen, NM32LA, RoHS; SW, Sieve 1.3 SP2 For Metabolomics On;  EXACTFINDER 2.0;  ISQ Trace 1300 PERF BUNDLE ? 120 V;  Trace 1300 SSL W/BKF Injector Module;  GC/GCMS Start-up Kit;  RSH LIQUID TOOL: D7 57 MM;  RSH LIQUID TOOL: D7 85 MM;  RSH Agitator Adapter for 2ML Vial;  and RSH VORTEXER.
This system is needed to enhance the analytical capabilities of EPA researchers within the CSS National Research Program.   Chemical compounds to be routinely measured within the CCS program often have highly similar molecular mass at very low concentrations in biological matrices so EPA requires an instrument capable of generating spectra characterized by high mass resolution, mass accuracy, sensitivity, and wide dynamic range.  Similarly biological compounds to be routinely measured within a single sample can widely vary in concentration and ionizability such that a large dynamic range and the option for analyses by multiple ionization sources is a critical need.  The attributes of the requested instrumentation are of utmost importance for the success of the research as it will both decrease the ambiguity involved in chemical identification (high resolution and accuracy) and the detection limits (sensitivity), while increasing the comprehensive nature of the analyses (dynam ic range and multiple ionization modes). 
EPA is limited by the amount of benchtop space available in its laboratory facility to house the instrument.  The relatively small footprint of the ThermoFisher QExactive Benchtop Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer system is a critical consideration as laboratory space is minimal and any additional laboratory space is expected to be consumed by sample processing and storage instrumentation.  The ThermoFisher QExactive Benchtop Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer system provides the level of resolution, accuracy, sensitivity, throughput, and dynamic range essential for the detection and discrimination of the types of biological compounds (i.e., biochemicals) being investigated by ERD researchers within EPA?s space limitations.  The fast polarity switching capabilities and rapid rate of detection characteristic of this instrument are required to meet the high throughput nature of the research for which it will be used.  Further, the fast polarity switching offered by the Q Exactive will allow for a reduction in analysis time and solvent use. Both types of ionization (ESI +and ESI -) are needed for more comprehensive chemical detection. The use of fast polarity switching will provide for the acquisition of both types of data on the same sample thereby reducing LC solvent use.  Therefore, the item is also more efficient and will reduce the environmental impact (in accordance with environmental management systems guidelines) when compared to instruments.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The anticipated award date is October 25, 2012.

<DESC>The National Cemetery Administration is soliciting offers under Solicitation No. VA-786-13-R-0033 for the following service:

This is a performance-based contract for cemetery Turf Renovation services at the Dallas/Fort Worth National Cemetery, 2000 Mountain Creek Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75211. The overall responsibility of the Contractor is to plan, coordinate, organize, manage, and perform the activities described herein, which are required to maintain an acceptable placement and aesthetic appearance of turfgrass. 

The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, supervision, professional expertise, vehicles, tools, materials, services, equipment and quality control necessary to provide Turf Renovation services at the Dallas/Fort Worth National Cemetery in a manner that will meet or exceed the requirements to present a clean, neat, professional, and aesthetic turfgrass appearance throughout the Cemetery in accordance with Contract Specifications and the Performance Work Requirement Summary (PWRS).  Services include, but are not limited to work consisting of killing and removing existing turfgrass, rototilling the existing topsoil,  adding or removing topsoil to establish a new finish grade, installing new turgrass sod, and establishing new turfgrass sod, preservation of existing cemetery features (lawns, paving, roads, stones, and markers), restoration of cemetery features disturbed or removed as a result of performing new work, as well as, repairing, replacing, or reinstalling any damaged cemetery property, such that at the end of the day the condition is as good as before commencement of work.  

Work shall be performed in strict accordance with all terms, conditions, specifications, schedules and drawings. Performance shall be in accordance with the requirements, conditions, terms and representations contained in this solicitation, any pertinent OSHA Occupational and Safety regulations, and any State and/or local regulations, laws and codes.

This acquisition is 100% set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, SDVOSB.  The NAICS Code is 5617301.  Size standard is $7Million.  Electronic solicitations will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov on or about November 29, 2012.  Responses to the solicitation are due at noon EST. on December 14, 2012.  Any amendments to the solicitation will also be available at www.fbo.gov.  Offerors are advised they are responsible for obtaining any amendments.  

Proposals will be evaluated on the following 3 factors: Past Performance, Technical Ability, and Price.  

Technical Ability:
	Technical capability will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear understanding of all features involved in performance of the requirements identified in the SOW.  The proposal should not simply restate the Government's requirements, but it should describe, in detail, how the Offeror intends to meet the requirements.

Past Performance:
	Past performance will be evaluated for quality, timeliness (ie recent), and relevance (ie experience in providing services similar in size, scope, and complexity as described in the SOW).  If no past performance information is readily available, the Offeror's past performance will be evaluated as Neutral.

Price:
	The Government will not consider offers that are unreasonably high or unrealistically low.  Price may be compared against the Government Cost Estimate or against the average mean of the offers received to arrive at a competitive range in determining too low or too high offers.  

The Government will make use of research to aid in establishing a more complete picture of responsibility and ability. Some of the research will be done through the following databases; this list is not all inclusive: D&B, PPIRS, SAM, VetBiz and SBA.

Rating scheme: The responsive proposals will be evaluated in two rounds.
The 1st evaluation round will be based on Price. The lowest bidder will not necessarily receive the award. Just providing a price with no substantial information on pricing and/or performance will result in an inferior proposal and it may be considered nonresponsive. The Government will not consider offers that are unreasonably high or unrealistically low.  Pricing may be compared against the Government Cost Estimate or against the average men of the offers received to arrive at a competitive range in determining too low or too high offers.
After the first evaluation round and the creation of the competitive range, there will be a second round of evaluation. In the second round the evaluation factors of Technical Qualifications and Past Performance, will be evaluated.  Overall, Factors 1 & 2 are equal to one another. In the event of a tie, Price will be the deciding factor. 

Information shall be submitted in the manner requested in Section E.2 and Section E.3 FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS.
Failure to submit all documentation required as required so may result in your submission being determined non-responsive and removed from further consideration.

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:Michelet Audige, Maintenance Engineer,  <br> 443-395-1424 Michelet.audige.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Repair and Maintenance of AN/AVS-7(10)B HUD Assemblies and Sub-assemblies <br> This is not a solicitation. This is only an estimate and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below. <br> This is a market survey to locate potential sources of supply for Repair and Maintenance of AN/AVS-7 (10)B with NSN: 5895-01-577-5425, HUD assemblies and subassemblies (flat panel, NSN: 5895-01-5893636, NSN: 5895-01-5893636). The HUD facilitates helicopter pilots to use the Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) as an enhancement to the goggles during flight operations. The HUD collects and displays critical flight symbology and converts it to visual imagery to the pilot over the ANVIS image. The HUD diminishes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army is seeking to identify vendors with the capability to supply an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract over a three year period. The vendors must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system. Potential offerors will be responsible to repair the nonfunctional components received from the government into  ones which meet the most current operational form, fit, and function as called out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days. This effort involves the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time. A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable. The U.S. Army will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort. <br>  <br> Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 13 December 2012, to CECOM LCMC PRD Directorate, ATTN: RDER-PRA-CA (Michelet Audige), Bldg 6007, APG, MD 21005 or email to Michelet.audige.civ@mail.mil: <br>  	Identification of the contractor as a Large or Small business. If a small business, please identify as an 8(a), HUB Zone, Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, or non-disadvantaged. <br>  	 Past performance for these items. The Contractor shall submit their part numbers, NSN, or nomenclature and the date of the last manufacturing effort of the same items for which they have repair experience. Government contract numbers, if applicable, shall be provided. <br>  	The contractor shall cite the quality standard (either Government or Industry) that shall be in place for this effort. <br>  	The contractor must provide information to show that they possess, or shall possess, adequate experience, knowledge, production plant facilities (equipment, tooling, and space) to enable them, or their subcontractors, to support this item. <br> All technical questions should be addressed to Michelet Audige (443) 395-1424, email address michelet.audige.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>  <br>

<RESPDATE>121312
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a stand-alone, direct-write electron beam lithography system to support nanofabrication research and development in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility. The system will be sited in a class 100 cleanroom and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies, ranging from nanolithography novices to experts in the field. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for a stand-alone, direct-write electron beam lithography system. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>NIST currently owns and operates multiple electron beam lithography systems in the CNST NanoFab that are heavily used for a wide range of projects, with the most in-demand system being a JEOL JBX-6300-FS. In order to increase NIST's capacity to serve users and provide continuous service during scheduled or unscheduled maintenance of the JEOL system, while minimizing the cost of retraining users, NIST has a need for a new stand-alone, direct write electron beam lithography system that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. RESOLUTION: The system shall be capable of fabricating a single write line of width 10 nm or less using a commercial electron beam lithography resist.</p>
<p>2. ACCELERATING VOLTAGE: The electron-optical system shall operate with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV or higher.</p>
<p>3. SCANNING SPEED: The system shall operate with a beam scanning speed of at least 50 MHz with position deflectors that are digitally controlled.</p>
<p>4. SUBSTRATE CAPABILITY: The system shall handle substrates from small piece parts up to and including circular wafers of at least 200 mm in diameter.</p>
<p>5. SAMPLE HOLDER: The system shall be supplied with 50 mm, 75 mm, 100 mm, 150 mm, and 200 mm sample holders. These substrate handling cassettes shall be fully compatible with NIST's existing JEOL JBX-6300 and enable cassettes and samples to be transferred seamlessly between the two systems.</p>
<p>6. SAMPLE LOADING: The system shall include a separate, load-locked vacuum chamber, evacuated by a turbomolecular pump, for automated loading and unloading of samples into the instrument, with a capacity of at least 10 individual sample holders.<br /><br />7. MECHANICAL STAGE: The system shall include a stage positioning system capable of less than1 nm placement precision, with stage travel of at least 150 mm in both x- and y-directions.</p>
<p>8. CURVED SURFACE WRITING: The system shall be capable of automatically adjusting and exposing non-planar surfaces with height variations of at least1 mm across the substrate. This component shall be fully integrated with the instrument and allow backward compatibility for use with NIST's current JEOL JBX 6300.</p>
<p>9. SOFTWARE: Existing users of CNST's JEOL JBX 6300 shall be able to operate the system with little or no retraining, and new users trained on one system shall be able to operate the other with little or no additional training. The operating control of the system shall be fully compatible and similar in job definition and pattern formatting to the JEOL JBX 6300, using compiled magazine files (.mgn) to run exposures.</p>
<p>10. MANUALS: All manuals necessary to operate and maintain the system shall be included in both printed and electronic form.</p>
<p>11. REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND AWARD: NIST anticipates issuing a Request for Proposals for the system no later than the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 (first quarter of calendar year 2013), and awarding a Purchase Order for the system no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 (third quarter of calendar year 2013).</p>
<p>12. DELIVERY and INSTALLATION: The delivery and installation of the system in the CNST NanoFab class 100 cleanroom shall be completed in less than 12 months ARO.</p>
<p>13. TRADE-IN AND REMOVAL OF EXISTING SYSTEM: The purchase order shall include trade-in of an existing Vistec VB300 E-beam lithography system, including de-installation and removal of the Vistec system from the CNST NanoFab class 100 cleanroom.</p>
<p>14. SERVICE SUPPORT: An aftermarket support option shall be available that includes a 24 hour response time (within the next business day) with a qualified field service engineer on site at NIST within this time period.</p>
<p>15. PAST PERFORMANCE: All systems proposed shall have a documented history of multiple instrument installations in research-based user facilities located within the United States, and the vendor shall provide references from these facilities in the response to this notice.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333314, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>PURPOSE: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Program Executive Office - Mission Assurance (PEO-MA), is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine sources with competencies to promote information assurance by supporting DISA's cyber innovation initiative for the Department of Defense (DoD) to assess capabilities which can support DoD that exist within the current market place. The cyber innovation initiatives are the DoD Program Executive Office for Information Assurance (PEO-MA) Identity and Information Assurance research and development projects which are meant to prove out and pilot cyber information assurance concepts that fit strategically for deployment as enterprise defense solutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the requirement is to provide the DISA PEO-MA with the ability to rapidly and effectively implement and manage a mobile device policy management capabilities solution based on policy constraints such as location. The "Policy-Based Mobility"(PBM) pilot will acquire and evaluate a set of mobile device detection system(s), possibly one or more, consisting of wireless sensors, server and management software package, and services to manage through geospatial position as a PBM attribute within DoD environments.</p>
<p>The effort will use mobile device detection/management solutions consisting of wireless sensors, server, management software package, and services to demonstrate and evaluate the usability of the various Contractor products and support service offerings. The Contractor shall provide a technical solution set consisting of mobile device detection/management system(s), wireless sensors, management software package, associated license(s), and training, installation and support services.</p>
<p>DISA seeks industry partners who can respond to these objectives by delivering additional, enhanced capabilities, e.g. leveraging DoD Identity and Access Management (IDAM) capabilities for access to DoD Enterprise web-services via controlled mobile device interfaces.</p>
<p><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the PBMD effort. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>All interested contractors (both large and small) are requested to provide written response to the questions below. A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, market maturity and technical capabilities within the Large and Small Business Community to provide the required capabilities.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for Painting the Gate Chamber Equipment, Colebrook Lake Dam, Colebrook, Connecticut.  This announcement is to determine the interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business and Small Business concerns as described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 238320.  The project is planned to be issued on or about February 2013 and is expected to take about six months.  The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00. <br>  <br> This project consists of painting the equipment contained within the gate chamber at the Colebrook River Dam to include six gate stems, three air exchange tubes, one spiral staircase and two sump pumps.  The existing paint coatings on these items have partially failed.  There are areas where the paint is peeling, blistering and rusted.  The Contractor shall remove the failed paint areas by abrasive blasting but leave the intact paint areas in place.  Existing paint is lead-based, the Contractor shall employ worker safety precautions.  The gate chamber is considered a permit-required confined space due to one exit/egress point.  The gate chamber is accessible only through by taking an elevator down into the tower, and then descending through the chamber using a spiral staircase.  The gate chamber is at the base of the service tower of the dam and is subject to high humidity levels and no air flow.  This will necessitate the Contractor installing an air exchange system in addition to the supplied air systems utilized by the workers.  The only source of outside air is the doorway at the top of the service tower, approximately 200' feet above the chamber.  The chamber is approximately 30' x 24' x 33' high, and does contain a roof hatch and Gantry crane that the Contractor may use. <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work components stated above.  Firms must submit past demonstrated experience with abrasive blasting of lead-containing paints, applying paints in confined spaces and experience with designing and installing air exchange systems.  Subcontractors may be used to demonstrate this past experience.  This experience must have been performed within the last five years.  Responses are due by December 19, 2012.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Kimberly B. Pumyea.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY TO IDENTIFY MITIGATION BANKS IN THE LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN AND VICINITY BASIN <br>  <br> This notice is for Sources Sought only.  This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or invitation for bid (IFB).  Solicitation, specifications, and drawings are not available.  The Tracking Number for this Sources Sought Announcement is W912P8-13-SS-0002.  The NACIS code for the proposed acquisition is 562910.  The Product Service Code is F113.  The Government will use responses to this Sources Sought notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions regarding the availability of businesses capable of performing this work.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District, solicits a capability statement from all qualified businesses.  <br>   <br> PROJECT INFORMATION:   <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN), is evaluating compensatory mitigation alternatives to compensate for unavoidable impacts to certain habitats caused by the construction of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS).  CEMVN seeks to identify mitigation banks in the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity (LPV) basin with available credits of certain habitat types which could be purchased to mitigate for unavoidable impacts from construction of the LPV HSDRRS.  This information will be used to evaluate, for the respective habitat types, the potential use of mitigation bank credits as an alternative to a CEMVN-constructed mitigation project in a Programmatic Individual Environmental Report (PIER). <br>  <br> Habitat types requiring mitigation in the Lake Pontchartrain basin include brackish marsh, intermediate marsh, wet bottomland hardwood, dry bottomland hardwood and swamp on the floodside of flood risk reduction levees.  Dry bottomland hardwood impacts could be mitigated with wet bottomland hardwoods.  A forthcoming Programmatic Individual Environmental Report (PIER) will consider, along with CEMVN-constructed alternatives, a mitigation bank alternative for those habitat types for which eligible banks exist.  Individual banks will not be evaluated nor disclosed in the PIER; only the use of mitigation banks in general will be analyzed and disclosed.  If, after consideration of all alternatives, CEMVN decides to move forward with use of mitigation banks for a given habitat type, a formal solicitation such as an RFP or an IFB would be utilized to solicit bids, and, if appropriate based on consideration of relevant factors, including costs, CEMVN may purchase mitigation bank credits to fulfill the compensatory mitigation requirements for that habitat type.  <br>  <br>   <br> It is incumbent upon a prospective mitigation bank to meet all of the following qualifications for eligibility.  To be considered as an alternative to satisfy the HSDRRS compensatory mitigation requirements for any particular habitat type, the mitigation bank would need to:  <br>  <br>  	be approved by CEMVN and in full compliance with its Mitigation Banking Instrument (MBI), its other legal instruments (such as its conservation servitude and its financial assurances) and the standards set forth in 33 CFR Part 332;  <br>  	have a service area that encompasses the impact(s) being mitigated and be physically located within the Lake Pontchartrain Basin as defined by the following boundaries:  in Louisiana, northeast of the Mississippi River, south of I-12, and west of the Chandelier Islands;  <br>  	provide habitat type(s) that match the habitat type(s) being mitigated (except that bottomland hardwood wet habitat may compensate for bottomland hardwood dry habitat impacts); <br>  	have mitigation credits as assessed using a version 1.0 of the Wetland Value Assessment Community Model available by January 15, 2013 to compensate for the impact(s) to the particular habitat to be mitigated; and <br>  	have a duly-recorded perpetual conservation servitude/easement. <br>  <br> IMPORTANT:  To be considered for use as compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts resulting from HSDRRS construction, banks must meet all eligibility requirements by January 15, 2013.  In the event CEMVN determines, based on changes to the scheduled IER release date, that this deadline should be extended, notice of such extension will be issued.  <br>  <br> At this time, CEMVN estimates that the following Average Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) are needed to mitigate for each habitat type.  These preliminary estimates are subject to change.  A prospective bank's ability to provide adequate AAHUs must be based on Wetland Value Assessment Swamp Community Model and Bottomland Hardwood Community Model version 1.0 dated May 20, 2011, using an intermediate sea level rise scenario and a 50 year project life in these models.  <br>  <br> At this time, CEMVN is seeking information on mitigation banks for the following habitat types (estimated AAHUs required per habitat type are subject to change prior to formal solicitation): <br>  <br> Flood side Bottomland Hardwood - Wet: 102 AAHUs <br> Flood side Swamp: 108 AAHUs <br>  <br> All interested mitigation banks that meet the above eligibility requirements are invited to submit a Capability Statement consisting of appropriate documentation demonstrating eligibility and should include:  <br>  <br> 1) Name, address, telephone and fax numbers;  <br> 2) Map showing bank location; <br> 3) Credits (expressed in AAHUs and in acres) available for each habitat type, with specific reference to whether the credits can mitigate for flood side and/or protected side impacts, or for banks pending MBI approval, provide the estimated number of credits that would be available by January 15, 2013;  <br> 4) Proof of approved Mitigation Banking Instrument or date of expected approval;  <br> 5) Proof of recorded perpetual conservation servitude/easement or anticipated date by which such a conservation servitude/easement would be recorded;  <br> 6) Indicate whether the bank has been approved by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources - Office of Coastal Management pursuant to LAC 43:I.724.F to provide mitigation credits for adverse impacts within the Louisiana Coastal Zone or indicate date of expected approval.    <br>  <br> IMPORTANT: The page limit for the capability package is 5 pages/12 pitch Times New Roman.     Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Corps in assessing availability of eligible mitigation banks and in evaluating use of mitigation banks as alternatives to CEMVN-constructed projects in the PIER.  Regardless of participation, in order to be considered for use to compensate for HSDRRS impacts, banks must meet all eligibility requirements (listed above) by January 15, 2013.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Statements that do not meet all requirements or which are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking small business sources for a supply with construction installation project entitled: Lower Granite Additional Spillway Weir.  The installation will occur at the Lower Granite Dam in Garfield County, Washington.  This will be a firm-fixed-price supply contract with construction installation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 332312 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.   <br>  <br> This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify businesses with the capability to accomplish the work.  This is not a solicitation.  Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside this requirement.   Please do not respond to this notice unless you will be responding to the solicitation. <br>  <br> 1) A capability statement expressing interest in this requirement, describing your company and its capability to complete a project of this scope, magnitude and complexity. Include a statement detailing any special qualifications and certifications, applicable to the scope of this project, held by your firm and/or in-house personnel.  <br>  <br> 2) A statement or list of your firm's current or past technical experience similar to or the same as the summary scope of work and construction magnitude for this requirement. Include a brief description of each project scope, schedule, and dollar value.  <br>  <br> 3) A statement or list of your firm's current or past performance similar to or the same as the summary scope of work.

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00PM on December 12, 2012. <br>  <br> Summary of Scope of Work: <br>  <br> To improve out-migrating fish passage at Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River, an Adjustable Spillway Weir (ASW) will be fabricated and installed.  The ASW will be a steel structure installed in a spillway bay that effectively raises the crest elevation of the spillway, allowing juvenile salmon and steelhead to pass the dam near the water surface under lower accelerations and lower pressures than conventional spillway gate openings, providing a safe and efficient passage route over the dam.  The ASW will incorporate a mechanical method to adjust the height of the weir crest allowing a variable discharge rate.  The system will also include some means of shutting off/turning on flow.  It is anticipated that the total weight of the component structures will be in the range of 180 to 230 tons.  The government expects to award a contract in August or September of 2013 and require the ASW to be fabricated, installed and operational by mid-March of 2014.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to the State University of New York at Buffalo for the retrieval and analysis of frozen blood&nbsp;specimens collected as a part of the Buffalo Cardio-metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) study. SUNY-Buffalo is the only source for these frozen blood specimens, which were collected from 2004 to 2009 from police officers enrolled in the BCOPS study. The frozen serum from study participants will be analyzed to measure three lipid biomarkers: apolipoprotein-A1, apolipoprotein-B, lipoprotein (a); and four metabolic markers: parathyroid hormone, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), and total triiodothyronine (T3). Measurement of these novel biomarkers will permit the examination of associations with 1) police-specific stressors (i.e. shift work, psychological stress) in a known high stress occupational group, and 2) subclinical Cardio-Vascular Disease (CVD) in a population known to have adverse levels of CVD risk factors. Additional information about this effort is found in the attached Statement of Work.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /></span>NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS AS THIS WORK WAS ISSUED AGAINST AN EXISTING AGENCY CONTRACT AND IS NOW COMPLETED.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 50 is to deobligate $32,763.19 in funding in support of Work Assignment 0-200. The period of performance for Work Assignment 0-200 was from March 3, 2011 through December 31, 2011. The objectives of Work Assignment 0-200 were detailed in Modification 9. The objectives of this work assignment have been previously posted in www.fbo.gov. Total American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding under this contract is $2,111,868.91.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.3)<br />1. Contracting Agency and Activity. The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey, Sacramento Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. This document sets forth the justification and approval for use of one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984.<br />2. Nature of Action Being Approved. The U.S. Geological Survey, Earthquake Science Center, requests award of a non-competitive procurement to Kinemetrics for multi-channel, strong motion Rock Series Granite recorders.<br />3. Description of Supplies or Services. Equipment consisting of seven Kinemetrics Rock Series Granite recorders (Four 36-channel, three 24-channel) to monitor the performance of structures during seismic shaking. The Western Earthquake Hazards Team (WEHZ) requires this equipment to fulfill a contract between the Veterans Affairs (VA) and the WEHZ to install seismic recorders in VA hospitals that are in seismically high or very high zones. <br />Since the 1960s the USGS has had an ongoing agreement with the Veteran&iquest;s Affairs (VA) to maintain and install strong motion instrumentation at their hospitals and facilities. Many of their hospitals are in seismically prone areas and indeed have suffered severe shaking from some of the major earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas over the last 30 years. They are required by law to instrument these facilities so that the ground motion that their buildings are subjected to is known. <br />Many facilities have sensors already but most sites are not instrumented in a way that the actual building performance can be assessed during a major earthquake. The VA has a seismic hazard commission and they have recommended that their important hospitals in seismically high and very high zones be fully instrumented in order to properly assess the likelihood of structural damage during shaking from a major earthquake. Many of the areas where the VA has major hospital facilities are identified as having a significant probability of a M6.7 earthquake in the next 30 years. The USGS Earthquake Hazards Team in Menlo Park has contracted with the VA to provide this instrumentation, installation, and maintenance for an initial period of three years.<br />In each building individual sensors are placed around the floors to determine the motion of each floor. Differencing the motion in each floor provides the strain in the columns holding the structure up. The sensors are then wired to a central recorder. Many of the buildings will require 24 or more single channel accelerometers. Each accelerometer is low-noise, low-power, and has stable characteristics over tens of years. The recorders (the subject of this purchase) need to be capable of sampling up to 36 channels simultaneously with a nominal 24 bit ADC. It needs to be very internet aware, and open source in order for us to integrate the current systems that we are working on. We are building an alarm system that will be installed in each building that monitors the amount of movement that building has undergone (assuming an earthquake has occurred) with respect to design values. The alarm system is an additional piece of software that uses the signals from the installed accelerometers. <br />4. Estimated Dollar Value. The total cost of the award is estimated to be $171,576. Purchase Request 0040059075 for the 36 channel recorders is for $109,584; combined with Purchase Request 0040043667 (item 0010) for the 24 channel recorders for $61,992. <br />5. Statutory Authority. The proposed action may be awarded without full and open competition under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source is available and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.<br />6. Rationale Supporting Use of Citation in No. 5. The Kinemetrics Rock series recorders offer features that are not available in any other product. The following is a list and an explanation of why each features or group of features is important.<br />1. The highest sample rate available on the Rock Series Granite recorder is 2000 samples per second (sps). This gives a bandwidth to 1000 Hz, which is important for detecting and locating damage in a building. For example if seismic waves travel at 3 km/s in the building then the waves travel 3m in a millisecond. That is about the distance between floors. To locate damage at a particular floor or between a floor would require sample rates at 1000 sps or greater. Only the Kinemetrics Rock system provides for the high sample rates without compromising sample rate selection in other data channels.
<p>2. The Rock software that is the operating system for the recorders has numerous unique features that make the Kinemetrics system more flexible and useful in a situation where building performance is being monitored and alarms are being declared. Such as:<br /><br />a) Multiple data streams.</p>
<p>This allows us to have multiple records from a single recorder at different sample rates and with different characteristics such as,<br />i) A fail-safe, locally recorded, permanent record of a triggered strong motion data (e.g., 200 sps)<br />ii) A ring buffer (e.g., 30 days) of continuous, high-sample rate data (e.g. 2000 sps), grabbed on-demand over the Internet (e.g., for structural research: potentially, one could locate the acoustic emissions from fractures in welds in the steel frame of the building)<br />iii) A telemetered (e.g., Internet) continuous data stream to the regional seismic networks.<br />iv) A telemetered (e.g., Internet) state-of-health data stream to the regional seismic networks<br />v) Similar telemetered data streams to the USGS PI's for the VA project<br />vi) Similar telemetered data streams to the on-site VA building engineering staff and VA management</p>
<p>b) Synthetic data streams.</p>
<p>For the VA project, we want the instrumentation to be able to generate real-time alerts if the building is shaken out-of-plumb during an earthquake. At a minimum, this will require real-time integration of velocity or acceleration to displacement.</p>
<p>The Kinemetrics OASIS software has built-in modules that can generate a velocity data stream from an acceleration data stream, and a displacement data stream from a velocity data stream. These data streams can be used interchangeably with the sampled data streams (e.g., the A/D data from the accelerometers). The Kinemetrics Rock system allows us to add software which we write to the Rock system to add capabilities to the system. No other vendor has such capability.</p>
<p>c) Customized and/or off-the-shelf.<br />The Kinemetrics Rock-based systems software, Rockhound, is user-programmable and extensible. Rockhound is based on the modern Java programming language, running on the Linux open-source operating system. Custom modules can be written in Java and integrated into the system. For example, ISTI has a module to integrate a Rocks system into an Earthworm seismic network. Custom transfer functions can be programmed to generate any data stream, which can then be used for triggering alarms, for example. For the VA project, we plan to develop a transfer function that will generate the (true/false) out-of-plumb signal for a building, which will cause the immediate notification of the VA building engineers that a structural failure has occurred.</p>
<p>d) Multiple Rockhound systems can operate together. Modules are available to replicate the data streams from one Rockhound system to another. Each system can then independently process the data in real-time. For example, the data stream can be split off to a second Rockhound system that can drive a real-time status display in the building engineer's office, without affecting the other data streams being telemetered, for example, to the regional seismic networks.</p>
<p>e) Secure data transmissions.<br />The Department of Interior requires that computers be secure. Secure data transmission satisfies part of that requirement. Because Rockhound sits on top of Linux, numerous techniques are available to secure data transmissions. One other vendor currently offers FTP as the method for transferring data over the Internet, which is not a secure protocol. (Neither the user ID/password authentication transaction or the data transmission are encrypted.)</p>
<p>f) Simplified maintenance. <br />The Kinemetrics Rock-based systems can be managed using a standard web browser. RefTek systems require a proprietary Windows or Palm program.</p>
<p>g) The Kinemetrics Rock-based systems are very flexible, and can be configured for virtually any combination of data channels (either an actual ground motion signal or a synthetic signal) and data destinations. The Rock OS defines a protocol for retrieving data and state-of- health information remotely as well as a user interface. The NSMP is very familiar with the user interface and significant software was been written based on the Rock protocol to remotely and automatically retrieve SOH and data. We do not have the resources to rewrite this software to talk to another system. Other systems are not similar. This software is our own and cannot be modified by someone else.</p>
<p>3. The channel wiring system for these recorders is completely compatible with the Kinemetrics Episensor that we have about 1000 already procured. It is essential that these recorders work seamlessly with the other devices we already have in order to ensure complete compatibility and communication. <br />7. Other Information. <br />The USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park has contracted with the VA to provide this instrumentation, installation, and maintenance. The project has been funded with a series of one year agreements, but has been ongoing since 2009. We have presently installed granite recorders in about 20 structures of which about 12 are VA hospitals; as well as the Factor Building at UCLA and the Federal Building in San Francisco. The government would incur undue hardship in cost and labor to learn a new system and maintain two different systems.<br />Each vendor has a unique method for communicating with its equipment (browser or ftp, for example), retrieving data, formatting data, and handling state-of-health information. A substantial investment is made in the computer programs that handle all if these processes. We have made this investment with the Rock-series recorders and the government would incur undue hardship in cost and labor to learn another system and continue to maintain two systems.<br />8. The Efforts to Identify Additional Sources Including the Market Research Conducted.<br />Equipment for monitoring the response of buildings to seismic shaking is made by Kinemetrics, Inc., Refraction Technology, Inc. and Geosig. However, the recorders must have certain high sample rates and have operating system features that allow us to add algorithms to it so we can calculate building performance in realtime. Only equipment from Kinemetrics has all of these unique features. No other vendors provide equipment with these required features. <br />Refraction Technology (Reftek) have adapted a recorder (RT-130) for the purpose of recording multiple channels in a building. The Reftek system does not have as many channels as the Kinemetrics Rock Series Granite recorders, as high sample rates, and as flexible an operating system particularly in terms of the ability for us (as users) to add modules to it. The equipment from Reftek did not meet the requirements deemed essential for this purpose with respect to sample rates and the extensibility of the operating system, and security. The operating system does not interface with the current Rockhound OS that we have a significant investment in.<br />There is not enough information on the Geosig systems in order to know if they would be able to meet our needs. However, from what we do know, they do not have the capability to use the specialized Rockhound Operating System in which we have a significant investment in. As well, their sample rates do not match our required rates that can be met by the Kinemetrics systems.<br />This acquisition will be synopsized in FedBizOpps as required by FAR 5.201 on or around September 4, 2012.</p>
<p>9. Future Plans to Permit Competition.<br />We continually work with other companies to try and integrate their systems and develop new ones in order for them to meet our needs. We plan on experimenting with other systems out there within the next few years to see if they provide a good solution for us.</p>
<p>10. Recommendation and Certification from Program Office <br />Based on the above, I recommend this acquisition be conducted on the basis of other than full and open competition. I certify that technical data which form a basis for this justification that are the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel are complete and accurate.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for QTY: (6) 3" diameter prime/production grade, on-axis, (0001) oriented (Si-face) semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) wafers with chemical mechanical polish (CMP) on the Si-face and at least an optical polish on the C-face. This combined synopsis/solicitation was prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number for this requirement is FA8601-12-T-0360 using FAR Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61, 20 Nov 2012.</p>
<p>This solicitation document is Full and Open Competition under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334413. Size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The AFLCMC/PZIO Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirements:</p>
<p>Requirements for the SiC Wafers, QTY (6):</p>
<p>1. Prime/Production grade means single crystal over the whole wafer with no grain boundaries and micropipe density less than 30 cm-2.<br />2. Wafers in round shape with the diameter of 3 inches (75 mm). <br />3. On-axis means surface parallel to the (0001) plane by 0.15 degrees or less.<br />4. Semi-insulating means a resistivity of 100,000 ohm-cm or higher over the whole wafer.<br />5. CMP is required on Si-face (0001) in addition to optical polish (on both faces) to reduce polishing damage to the wafer surface.<br />6. SiC comes in a variety of crystal structures called polytypes. Either 6H or 4H is acceptable.<br />7. 3C SiC is often grown on Si wafers. This material is not acceptable because the Si wafer cannot be made semi-insulating. <br />8. Only bulk wafers (a whole piece of SiC wafer with thickness larger than 350 microns) are acceptable. Thin layers of SiC on other substrates are not acceptable because of potential reactions between the substrate and the furnace environment where the wafers will be used.</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (May 2011). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>

Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p><br />A CONTINUING RESOLUTION, also known as a "CR" is legislation enacted by congress that continues funding for specific ongoing activities if the fiscal year appropriation has not been enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>"Due to the Continuing Resolution, funds are presently available through March 27, 2013 (H.J. RES.117). The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond March 27, 2013. If funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance beyond the above cited date, the Contractor will receive notification in writing by the Contracting Officer."</p>

<DESC><p>U.S. Department of Transportation<br />Research Innovative and Technology Administration (RITA) <br />Research, Development and Technology Office, RDT-50<br />1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE <br />Washington, DC 20590</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), being issued on behalf of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting information and descriptions (White Papers) for activities to validate initiatives in support of the U.S. DOT Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information (CRS&amp;SI) technologies program for transportation infrastructure development and construction. At the level of the PRIME offeror (Applicant), competition is restricted to universities. Proposed SUB-Recipients may, however, be any kind of organization or individual, commercial or otherwise. Interested and eligible offerors may submit separate White Papers on one or more of the focus areas described in this announcement. Each White Paper on each focus area must not exceed fifteen (15) pages, excluding any appendices (cost match documents, partnership letters etc. not to exceed 5 pages) and must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. The paper shall be typed, double-spaced, using 12-point font, ARIAL, and printed on 8 1/2" x 11" paper. Separate White Papers must be submitted for each proposed project/focus area and multiple projects/initiatives cannot be combined into a single White Paper.</p>
<p>SCOPE: The CRS&amp;SI technologies program is authorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) (PL 109-59) &sect; 5506. SAFETEA-LU authorized funding for this program. The U.S. DOT RITA manages the CRS&amp;SI technologies program. RITA intends to award multiple Cooperative Agreements from this BAA. All awards made are subject to availability of program funds.</p>
<p>This SAFETEA-LU program focuses on major national initiatives and validation of CRS&amp;SI technology applications which deliver smarter and more efficient methods, processes and services for transportation infrastructure development and construction. The program awards will be competitively selected from individual/consortia teams of university research entities working in partnership with industry and state agencies, and meeting the technical and cost sharing requirements of this announcement.</p>
<p>Commercial remote sensing products include remote sensing technologies and data from above-ground platforms - e.g. satellites, aerial vehicles etc. Spatial information technology products include technologies and data from Geospatial Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems and other related services. The proposals should focus on CRS&amp;SI technology products applicable to transportation infrastructure development and construction.</p>
<p>These focus areas are chosen based on DOT priorities for CRS&amp;SI technology applications for user services that have the potential to produce a high return on investment, in terms of saving costs and improving the efficiency and practices of infrastructure development, planning, construction and condition assessment procedures. Therefore, in order to ensure safe and efficient movement of people and freight within the national transportation infrastructure system, this program is soliciting projects dedicated to reduce inefficiencies, improve system performance, and assess infrastructure condition through implementation of applied research. Specific focus areas include:</p>
<p>&bull; Risk Assessment &amp; Evaluation: network level risk assessment and evaluation of transportation infrastructure associated with natural calamities such as floods, storms, hurricanes, earth quakes etc.;<br />&bull; Post-hazard Response: network level inspection and evaluation technologies for bridges, large culverts, tunnels, sign structures, etc. that provide quantitative data for planning, maintenance, and management;<br />&bull; Planning, operations, maintenance &amp; program development: infrastructure systems to include waterways, highway facilities, freight, public transportation, intelligent transportation systems and railroads; and<br />&bull; System deficiency detection &amp; damage prevention: pipeline systems;</p>
<p><br />The proposed approach addressing any of the focus areas must pursue all of the following objectives:</p>
<p>1. Apply and validate CRS&amp;SI technologies to collect data and provide a framework for analysis in studies and projects related to infrastructure development design, planning and construction;</p>
<p>2. Apply advances in space-based technology applications to increase efficiency and safety, reduce congestion and shorten the time required to develop multimodal transportation options;</p>
<p>3. Apply concepts of CRS&amp;SI technology integration and products to monitor the condition of constructed infrastructure systems and provide quantitative data to reduce/supplement components of current visual inspection procedures;</p>
<p>4. Develop and apply decision support systems using CRS&amp;SI data and visualization techniques to effectively monitor/assess the condition of new/existing infrastructure systems;</p>
<p>5. Develop tools/products and effectively disseminate the results to relevant transportation user-communities such as academia, private sector and public sector agencies; and</p>
<p>6. Develop and execute a comprehensive project outreach program to effectively inform and disseminate project results and products to relevant transportation user-communities such as academia, private sector and public sector agencies;</p>
<p><br />WHITE PAPERS: RITA is soliciting White Papers that address one or more of the focus areas outlined in this announcement (see above). A proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least half (50%), in accordance with SAFETEA-LU Section 5101 (a)(1) and (b), of the proposed project's cost to be considered. In other words, the grand total dollar amount of an Applicant's proposed cost-sharing contribution to the project must be equal to the total dollar amount of the Federal funding sought by the Applicant. Each White Paper on each focus area must not exceed fifteen (15) pages, excluding any appendices (cost match documents, partnership letters etc. not to exceed 5 pages) and must include sufficient information to determine the probability of achieving the objectives of the focus area and to evaluate the following areas (All evaluation factors are of equal importance):<br /><br />1) Technical approach and plans for validating the concept for transportation application;<br />2) Objectives addressing the focus area;<br />3) Background of the performing consortia team in related areas of technologies and space based technology application; <br />4) Proposed partnerships between cooperating consortia of university centers, industry and state agencies; and<br />5) Proposed cost and cost sharing contributions to perform the proposed project;</p>
<p>Please utilize the following outline in the generation of your White Papers:</p>
<p>1) Concept of Proposed Research<br />2) Approach and Research Plan<br />3) Team Background<br />4) Partnerships <br />5) Budget (Federal + Cost Share)</p>
<p><br />EVALUATION AND SELECTION FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION: Based on evaluation of the responses received, the U.S. DOT may select one or more focus areas for awards and may choose to fund selected areas through Cooperative Agreements. As stated above, half (50%) cost sharing is required from proposing consortia teams to perform the tasks. Cost sharing may include direct, indirect and in-kind cost contributions and can be made collectively from the consortia of university research centers, industry and state agencies. Proposed partnerships and cost sharing arrangements need not be finalized in the White Papers submitted in response to this announcement; but proposed partnerships and cost-sharing arrangements will need to be finalized and presented in detail in any full proposals that RITA may hereafter request from the authors of the best White Papers submitted. The period of performance for completing each project and delivering results must not exceed 24 months. A panel of federal agency experts will review all White Papers received for responsiveness to the areas specified above. Each offeror submitting a White Paper meeting the criteria of this BAA and deemed worthy of further consideration will be notified of an opportunity for a detailed oral presentation.</p>
<p>CONTACT INFORMATION: In all correspondence, please reference the BAA number. Two hard copies and one electronic copy of each White Paper shall be submitted. Hard copies shall be submitted via overnight delivery system to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Mr. Tran Dinh Phu <br />CEO / General Director<br />Saigon Water Supply Corporation<br />Office #1<br />Cong Truong Quoc Te, District 3<br />Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam<br />Phone Number: +84 8 8227427<br />Fax Number: +84 8 8241644<br />Email: <a href="mailto:Sawaco_Tapmu@Vnn.Vn">Sawaco_Tapmu@Vnn.Vn</a><br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance for the Saigon Water Corporation (SAWACO) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Strategy and Implementation Plan in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Grantee, SAWACO, was established in 1874 to manage HCMC water supply operations and is a government-owned enterprise operating under the HCMC Peoples' Committee. In 2005, SAWACO's current structure was established as a holding company with subsidiaries. The technical assistance was requested by SAWACO to improve its ICT systems to enhance management and operational efficiency in the Ho Chi Minh City water supply system.</p>
<p>The technical assistance would help enhance information management and the existing ICT strategy by: offering an objective assessment of the technical environment at SAWACO and then recommending an ICT architecture including ICT applications, data, technology, and network parameters; defining policies, standards, and procedures for ICT governance and decision making; recommending an organizational structure for supporting ICT; and providing an ICT Implementation Plan with a schedule and budget. In turn, the ICT Implementation Plan would focus on evaluating and recommending systems such as SCADA, information management, GIS, billing and accounting systems, and asset inventory and management systems. By helping SAWACO improve its operations, business and strategic planning, the assistance would help it to meet its potable water supply goals for both residential and industry users to meet HCMC's demand.</p>
<p>The purpose of the technical assistance is to help SAWACO improve its ICT systems and practices to enhance management and operational efficiency in the Ho Chi Minh City water supply system in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $593,660 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in Vietnamese directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, January 18th, 2013</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full text:<br />--52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -Commercial Items, (February 2012) is incorporated by reference. It is amended to read: Submit signed and dated offer to Shanickiau Fowler email shanickiau.fowler@altus.af.mil and Lori Clinton lori.clinton@altus.af.mi no later than noon CDT,&nbsp;7 Dec 2012. Bidder must attach pricing to the excel spreadsheet titled "Attachment 2: Bid Sheet).</p>
<p>--52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items:<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1. This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures. For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between past performance and price will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>2. Offeror shall propose on all Contract Line Item Number (CLINs) 0001 thru 0009, 1001 thru 1009, 2001 thru 2009, 3001 thru 3009, and 4001 thru 4009, via attachment labeled "Attachment 2: Bid Schedule". Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.<br />3. Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>4. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price: Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the schedule by the proposed unit price for each CLIN to confirm the extended amount for each. All CLIN extended amounts for the base and all options years will be totaled for evaluation purposes. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness subject to the processes described in paragraphs d, e and f. Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate, if applicable.</p>
<p>b. Technically acceptable: technically acceptable will be defined for this solicitation for washers as all washers used on this contract must be listed on the Energy Star commercial washers list located at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=clotheswash.display_commercial_cw.<br />Technically acceptable for the dryers must be commercial grade deemed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>c. Past Performance: The contracting officer will seek relevant and recent (within the past 3 years) performance information on all technically acceptable offerors based on (1) references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. "Past Performance Survey" attachment 3 will be used to obtain present and past performance information. Relevant information includes performance of work efforts involving lease and maintenance of washers and dryers.</p>
<p>The offeror shall send the "Past Performance Survey" to a minimum of three references but no more than five overall. If more than five past performance surveys are received prior to the solicitation due date, the first five received by the Contracting Officer will be used to assess past performance. Additionally, if less than three references are submitted by the solicitation due date an "unknown confidence rating" will be given.</p>
<p>The offeror not the government is responsible for ensuring their references complete the "Past Performance Survey" and send the survey directly to the 97th Contracting Squadron, Altus AFB, OK before proposal submission deadline. A minimum of three references shall be received but no more than five overall.<br />The offeror shall complete one each of the attachment labeled "Reference Sheet" for each reference and submit at least a minimum of three reference sheets but no more than five overall to the 97th Contracting Office, Altus AFB, OK before the proposal submission deadline.</p>
<p>The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall confidence assessment rating of exceptional (blue), satisfactory (green), marginal (yellow), or unsatisfactory (red). Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive an "unknown confidence" rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. However, a rating other than unknown confidence may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing, a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts. When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond.<br /><br />RATING DEFINITION<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br />d. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and is judged to have an overall substantial confidence performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated substantial confidence, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated substantial confidence for past performance. An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be the most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria. If no proposals are rated substantial confidence, an integrated assessment will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror determined to be the most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.<br />e. If a lower priced technically acceptable offer is determined to have an unreasonable discussions may be required.<br />f. The contracting officer may determine at any point in the process to open discussions. If the contracting officer determines discussions are necessary, all offerors will be evaluated on past performance and price. The competitive range may then be limited to the number of proposals that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offers. Discussions will be conducted, Final Proposal Revisions requested, and the source selection authority will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />g. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.<br />h. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Clarifications conducted to resolve relevance of the past performance information, adverse past performance information, or minor clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br />i. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Therefore, each initial offer must address information in accordance with the paragraphs above and should contain the offerors's best price and past performance reference list. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>Past Performance submissions will be rated for relevancy using the below chart.</p>
<p>Very Relevant Present/past performance efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this RFP. <br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. <br />Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires. <br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333911 with a small business size standard of 500.00 employees.This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids.The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2012-12-13 16:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.FOB Destination shall be Montrose, CO 81401 <BR> <BR>The Bureau of Reclamation requires the following items, Meet or Exceed, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Provide two (Total) identical air compressors to replace two Sullair LS-16-75L WCWC compressors. Compressors must meet or exceed the following Specifications 	- 75HP 3/60/480volt heavy duty variable frequency wiht variable speed drive that adjusts output to meet continuous air demand          - Rotary Screw Compressor          - 100 PSI nominal air pressure          - Operating range from ~80 PSI to ~105 PSI          - 325 ACFM Capacity or better per each compressor          - Compressor room dimensions not to exceed 16? x 16? with 12? ceilings (approximate)          - Oil Flooded          - 8,000 hour compressor lubricant          - Biodegradable lubricant          - Operating noise level at 72db or below          - Intake air filter efficiency of 99.99% per SAE J726C          - Water Cooled          - Modern electronic control that provides:              - Automated lead/lag for equalizing run time              - Adjustable load/unload set-points              - Remote monitoring/control              - Alarming to include air filter trouble          - Complies with NEMA 12 and other applicable standards          - 5 year warranty covering air end, motor, air/fluid receiver, fluid cooler and after cooler
This is for the supply only. The Bureau is responsible for the removal of the existing compressors and installation of the new units.
Additional application information - The two compressors provide redundant supply to Station Service Air; i.e. each compressor can provide full demand independently. The station service air system has one 140 cf receiver tank. The largest demand use of the compressors is air admissions into a hydroelectric turbine during certain water flows to reduce vibration caused by cavitation. The variable frequency/variable speed compressor should minimize cycling while supplying the continuous demand which is close to (but less than) the capacity of each requested compressor independently. Other uses of station service air include various tools and processes including pressurizing lubrication systems, water, and sewage, basic pneumatic tools for 4-6 workers. The compressor room has water hookups for the existing water cooled Sullair LS-16 air compressors. The room is clean and free from excessive air-borne particulate., 2, EA; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9WdCBM%2Bp7XrfQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

Question 1 Can we get the schematic for the current Achtley 211A servo valve, command voltage needed and any specific accuracy requirements? Answer 1 Servo valves are not part of this procurement, specification 14 in the Statement Of Work (SOW) is included only to specify that the servo valve footprint must be sized for Atchley 211A servo valve ports.  The list of components required to be provided are listed in the SOW table at the front of the document.  The manifold includes all components listed in Figure 1.	Also note that were not looking for loose components to be delivered with the manifolds.  Per specification #10, all valves and components shall be provided and installed in the manifold. Question 2 Is on-site installation/integration a requirement? Answer 2 No on-site installation or integration is required. Question 3 This solicitation is for the manifold assemblies, however, Item No. 10, states that All cartridge valves and components shall be provided and installed in the manifold prior to delivery.  Will NASA be providing these valves? Or do you want us to provide a quote to include the price of the valves as well? Answer 3 Manifolds shall be provided with valves and components called out in figure 1.	Those valves and components shall be installed prior to delivery. *****NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED***** The due date for responses is extended to 4:00 pm CST 11/30/2012 Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>During the process of finalizing the LISC OM&amp;S RFP, a review of the Centers of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) designations indicates that more than one organic depot may be capable of performing tasks necessary for LISC OM&amp;S.&nbsp; Thus, more than one organic depot could potentially be utilized to meet the LISC OM&amp;S Public-Private Partnership (PPP) requirements established in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).&nbsp; The most recent version of the LISC OM&amp;S draft RFP stated that Offerors may only utilize one organic depot in developing their proposals: Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC).</p>

<p>The Government requests that&nbsp;interested potential Offerors for the LISC OM&amp;S effort provide a short (one page or less should suffice) response to this Public-Private Partnering issue.&nbsp; Please provide the response via email to Andrew Doud (Andrew.Doud@us.af.mil) no later than 4:00 pm (1600) Pacific Time on Wednesday, 5 December 2012.</p>

There is no solicitation available at this time.     Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes are 517210, 517410 and 517919.  Respondents to this announcement must identify their business type (i.e., large, small, small and disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned small, HUB Zone certified small, or service disabled veteran-owned small business) in their response.   <br>   The Government is seeking a Managed Service Communications vendor to provide a network and services which will support PEO C3T assets, allowing them to send and receive information in tactical situations.  The Government provides a Strategic Communications Hub connected to a commercial integrated broadband IP satellite solution provider which extends the capabilities of the Department of Defense's core network.  The Government provides Baseband services including  Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router, Secure Internet Protocol Router, Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, CENTCOM Regional Intelligence Exchange System, Commercial and Net Equipment, Tactical Communications Platforms, Mobile Broadband Global Area Network Access Capabilities, SATCOM Terminals (Large, Very Small Aperture Terminal, Hand Held), Highly Mobile Communications, Very High Frequency, Ultra High Frequency, Ku, Ka, C, X, L, Land Mobile Radio, Mobile satellite services ( e.g., Satellite Phones, Secure Personal Digital Assistants, Cell Service Development.   <br>   To meet mission requirements, the Government requires a cost effective turn-key solution which includes:   <br>   1.

An immediate and effective way to restore essential communications when they have been interrupted or lost.   <br>      <br>   There is an additional consideration with respect to Information Assurance (IA).  To ensure that Sensitive Information is protected, the Government adheres to Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) (DoDI 5200.4).  The Government adheres to the National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation process (NIACAP) for all Federal Departments and agencies.  Typically a service provider must demonstrate past performance of the deployment of a global IP VSAT architecture that included an Authority to Connect (ATO) to a DISN Leading Edge Services (LES) without waiver and DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG) Authority To Operate (ATO) on SIPRNET.  In addition to the above, the implementation of Department of the Army Regulations such as the Army Regulation 25-2, November 14, 2003, Information Assurance (AR 25-2) will augment the requirements of the DITSCAP.  This includes a capability to support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES).  The Government provides a security plan addressing each network, hardware and software item of the DoD 8510.1-M, DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) Application Manual as part of its quotation, that addresses in detail its security solutions for supporting the security requirements. This requirement includes past performance of executing the Facility Security Clearance (FCL) process and of network operations and customer care in a cleared facility.   <br>      <br>   The contractor will be responsible for service assurance, delivery, availability/integrity of the network, as well as 24/7/365 proactive monitoring of the network. Proactive monitoring of the network must include a staffed Network Operations Security Center (NOSC). The contractor will also be responsible for operating a reactive trouble management and help desk capability. This capability will be a facility that provides full time (24x7x365) reactive trouble management and help desk functions. The contractor will manage this capability as a single point of contact tier 1 and tier 2 customer care and technical support staff operation. In order to be considered the contractor must provide technical, operational and support staff with current active secret or top secret clearances.   <br>      <br>   The contractor must be capable of providing both network services and user services.  Network services shall include satellite reach back, LMR, cellular, wired and wireless Ethernet and radio gateway. User services shall include SVoiP, VoIP, VTC, email, chat, white boarding, common operating picture (COP), incident command system, web portal and directory services.     <br>      <br>   The period of performance is expected to be a five (5) year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.            <br>      <br>   In conjunction with the above referenced services, the Government anticipates outleasing facility space pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.   2667. This facility space would be used to house contractor equipment which will be required for the provision of services.   <br>      <br>   Firms capable of performing the described services are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience in writing.  Responses shall be limited to 5 pages and should include, as a minimum, (1) evidence of relevant past experience; (2) related projects and/or existing systems, etc; and (3) business size as described above.      <br>      <br>   This sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the requirement that the respondent's white paper address estimated costs for each task identified in this Sources Sought Announcement.   <br>  <br>  <br> Synopsis:   <br>    <br> This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal. All information received will be used for planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote.  The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.  <br>    <br> The United States (U.S.) Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Aberdeen, MD, 21005 intends to extend the period of performance on Contract W15P7T-06-C-T004 by an additional six (6) months, from 31 March 2013 to 30 September 2013.  The extension will ensure program continuity and critical mission support while allowing the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated with a follow-on procurement.  The extension will provide for the following services in support of the AN/TPQ-53 radar system:  program management; reliability improvement and management; maintainability improvement and management; repair activities; command center support; field service representatives (FSRs); training for FSRs; operations and maintenance training, system support package updates; diminishing resources/obsolescence management services; test support; software support; and spares during production, deployment, testing and fielding.  Interim Contractor Support (ICS) is required for 32 accelerated Initial Production AN/TPQ-53 radar systems to ensure the sustainment of the systems prior to development and implementation of the formal supportability concept.  The Contractor is required to support up to 12 deployed IP and LRIP AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems in Afghanistan.  The Contractor shall be required to support the remaining delivered IP AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Germany.  <br>    <br> The AN/TPQ-53 radar is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from rocket, artillery and mortar systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps and will ultimately replace the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radars; fully supporting brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 radar will interoperate with future battle command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-53 radar will be capable of being deployed as part of the indirect fire protection capability system of systems to provide a sense and warn capability for fixed and semi-fixed sites.  The AN/TPQ-53 radar will provide a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating rocket, artillery and mortar firing positions.   <br>    <br>    <br> Responses to Sources Sought Announcement:    <br>    <br> Interested sources must comply with the following requirements:   <br>    <br> Identification of contractor as a large or small business and type (HUB Zone, 8(a), Women-Owned, or Non-Disadvantage).  <br>    <br> Provide Past Performance data on the aforementioned services in support of production and deployment. Provide back-up information to demonstrate availability of adequate production facility and resources (experienced personnel with training acquired and years of experience with manufacturing and/or repairing item(s), necessary equipment and tooling, space etc.) to successfully perform and satisfy the Government's requirements.  <br>    <br> Provide current quality standard certification and quality standard that would be in-place for contractual efforts; specify when certification was obtained and revalidated if applicable.   <br>    <br> Provide capability statement with supporting detailed technical, logistical and managerial back-up data to demonstrate parts of the requirement in which interest lies in. Also indicate whether item(s) or service of interest will be manufactured and/or performed in the Continental United States (CONUS) or Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) and if so, specify location of production facility.   <br>    <br> Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper that is no more than 20 pages in length.  In the white paper, the contractor shall clearly identify which of the aforementioned tasks they are qualified to perform and shall address the technical approach, and schedule constraints associated with each of the tasks.  The contractor shall clearly identify assumptions on which the response is predicated.  As a minimum, identify any required GFE or Government furnished information (GFI) on which the effort is predicated; and all required Government support anticipated.  Also identify and discuss plans and risks associated with reuse, or dependency on any other awarded contract.  <br>    <br> All responsible sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort by 1700 hours (Eastern Standard Time) on Monday, 03 December 2012 to ALL of the following Government personnel via email:  <br>    <br>  Marc Concilio (Contract Specialist), Marc.A.Concilio.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Evan Schlisserman (Contract Specialist), Evan.M.Schlisserman.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Lawrence Holton (Contracting Officer), Lawrence.J.Holton.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Monique Cranshaw (Contracting Officer Representative), Monique.Y.Cranshaw-Sanders.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Paul Stultz (Technical Lead), Paul.C.Stultz.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Paul Barsamian (Technical Lead), Paul.A.Barsamian.civ@mail.mil  <br>    <br>  No hard copy or facsimile submissions will be accepted.    <br>

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>A) The offeror shall provide the government, with its offer submission, written verification from the GSA schedule holder that an agreement exists that validates the offeror's right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA schedule holder, if other than the offeror; and,  B) By proactively complying with this offer term, sellers accept that the government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee.  Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government. <BR> <BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>[Prescription:  Include this clause in Purchase Orders for non-commercial items.]   The prospective contractor shall complete the electronic annual representations and certifications, FAR 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2006) at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (see FAR 4.1102).  The Offeror shall submit to the Contracting Officer a copy of the completed representations and certifications with its offer. The prospective contractor shall update the representations and certifications submitted to ORCA as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete. The representations and certifications are effective until one year from date of submission or update to ORCA. <BR> <BR>[Prescription:  Include this clause in solicitations and contracts that require on-site contractor personnel; otherwise, do not include.]  (a) Personnel provided under this contract shall not be under pending charges and shall have not been convicted of any felony within the last 10 years, or any misdemeanor within the last 5 years (excepting minor motor vehicle infractions for which the individual paid a fine or posted collateral in the amount of $300 or less), which would indicate violent or disruptive conduct, dishonest conduct, untrustworthiness or unreliability which could reasonably affect performance on the contract or pose a security concern with respect to access to Library buildings or grounds, property or collections.  Note that the term "convicted" would include a disposition of "probation" or "probation before judgment."   (b) Should any person employed by the contractor to perform work under this contract be convicted of any of the aforesaid offenses, the contractor agrees to remove the individual from the contract performance and return all Library building and stack passes issued to the individual.  The contractor also agrees to remove any individual under pending charges for any felony or misdemeanor with the exceptions noted above until such time as the final disposition is known.   (c) Upon request of the Library, the contractor will identify personnel to be assigned to work under the contract and submit a FD-258 (contractor fingerprint chart) and any other necessary administrative forms provided by the Library so that a background check may be conducted.  The parties agree that the Library has final authority to determine the suitability of contractor personnel who perform work under this contract.  Nevertheless, the fact that the Library may conduct background checks on assigned contractor personnel does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide qualified, reliable personnel of sound character and conduct. <BR> <BR>The prospective contractor shall complete the electronic annual representations and certifications, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications ?Commercial Items (Feb 2009) at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (see FAR 4.1102).  The Offeror shall submit to the Contracting Officer a copy of the completed representations and certifications with their offer.  The prospective contractor shall update the representations and certifications submitted to ORCA as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete. The representations and certifications are effective until one year from date of submission or update to ORCA.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. <BR> <BR>(g) Invoice.

(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR)
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <BR> <BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

All offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be eligible for award.  Firms that recognize and can produce the required item described above are encouraged to identify themselves.  Firms are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by accessing the website www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/ and looking under Qualification Procedures for Aviation Requirements.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency.  The closing date annotated is an estimated date and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of release for solicitation; however, the solicitation will not close prior to the date stated above.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Patrick C. Martinez, Phone 2023146247, Email Patrick.Martinez@NTSB.gov
<DESC><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency with the primary mission of investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation-railroad, highway, marine, and pipeline-and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p>The NTSB has a requirement for telecommunications support for telephone service at the NTSB Headquarters located at 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20594. This requirement is conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)-Soliciting from a single source. The NTSB intends to issue a non-competitive award to&nbsp;Southwestern Bell, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T. &nbsp;The period of performance of this requirement is from October 1, 2012 - September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>Southwestern Bell&nbsp;currently provides this service via existing Southwest data lines. The technical risk would be significant if the NTSB were to change contractors for this requirement. If the NTSB were to change contractors, there could be loss of service to both the NTSB and many of its clientele during a transition as new data lines are installed and configured. These are telecommunications circuits which, in many cases, use hard-coded sending and receiving software. The cost to change contractors and to recode software would not be cost effective or in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p>Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice must include the following: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and/or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These capability statements shall be no greater than 5 pages plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included.</p>
<p>The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submission. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Parties must submit information within five (5) days of publication of this notice. The NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiry will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to <a href="mailto:Patrick.Martinez@ntsb.gov">Patrick.Martinez@ntsb.gov</a>.</p>

Request For Information

It is the intent of the Navy Strategic Sourcing Department to issue a solicitation to provide for a breadth of services to cover a broad set of needs, the capability to support various cost structures, scalability, functionality for sharing best practices, and communication tools for the vendor community. The Professional Analysis and Support Services (PASS) solution will provide Navy and Marine Corps customers, with a responsive, efficient, and reliable means of obtaining professional contractor support service to meet operational objectives. This contract is intended to be a Proof in Concept which, if successful, will be deployed on a larger scale for future iterations.
 The contract will provide direct labor and management to perform specific non-personal services as defined in the individual task orders. Services will encompass a diverse array of professional services within the following functional areas:

 Standard Program Management Services
o Comprehensive Standard Program Management Services
o Project/Program Management Services 
o Financial Management Services
o Information Technology Support Services
o Administrative Support Services

 Logistics Management Services 
o Logistics Support Services
The PASS solution establishes a consistent acquisition vehicle to meet the objectives and recommendations identified by the Strategic Sourcing Commodity Team.
 A consistent acquisition vehicle will enable many of the benefits outline in the strategy and will help capture data for strategy refinement going forward. Potential benefits of a consistent acquisition vehicle will be:

 Cost savings through increasing competition amongst an expanded vendor base;
 Reduction of administrative requirements and increased speed of execution through a repeatable process;
 Consistency of acquisition process to guide and help Industry and the Acquisition Workforce;
 Increased spend visibility by collecting data to assess and continually refine strategies going forward;
 Ability to house tools and templates and integrate them into the acquisition process;
 External communication tool to form a consistent point of contact for the vendor community.

This requirement will be solicited and awarded using the policies and procedures of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. A commercial Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) with Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) provisions is intended and will be synopsized and awarded competitively.
 The Navy intends to award multiple contracts resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offerors whose proposal is determined most advantageous considering technical merit, past performance, and price. The Government anticipates the award of competed task orders in response to the Governments requirement in accordance with FAR 16.505. Task orders will provide fair opportunity to all interested contract holders for the applicable suite. At the ordering level, the Contracting Officer may issue either CPFF or FFP type orders. The ordering period shall consist of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods. 

This office is seeking guidance from Industry in the following areas:
1.
 Market Segmentation  Through the Strategic Sourcing Process, the commodity team defined Standard Program Management Services to consist primarily of the following four functional areas; Project/Program Management Services, Financial Management Services, Information Technology Support Services, and Administrative Support Services. Is this an accurate reflection of market segmentation as defined by industry? If not, how could it be more accurately reflected? 

2. Draft Performance Work Statement  Attached is a sample PWS for Comprehensive Standard Program Management Services. Does the draft Performance Work Statement accurately reflect the breath of services required in the various functional areas while allowing for the flexibility for individual requirements to be met? Please provide any suggestions for improvement.

3.
 Labor Categories  Attached is a spreadsheet, DRAFT  Prime Pricing Model with preliminary list of labor categories and their minimum qualification requirements identified in attachment PASS Labor Category. Is this an all inclusive list to accurately reflect the breath of services required? Please provide any additional labor categories or suggestion for those that should be removed. Please also provide the suggested minimum qualification requirements for proposed labor categories.

4. Acquisition Strategy  Please provide any comments or suggestions on the general acquisition strategy identified above. What steps could the Government take to improve the strategy or incentives industry participation?

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS NOW CHANGED FROM SOLE SOURCE TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
SYNOPSIS CONSTANT VOLUME SAMPLING AND BAG SAMPLING UNIT UPGRADES

In Accordance with Far Part 12, Commercial Items, the U.S. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), located in Ann Arbor Michigan is seeking to procure Upgrades to their Constant Volume Sampling (CVS) and Bag Sampling Unit (BSU). 
The current CVS/BSU in Heavy Duty Cell 1 was acquired in the late 1990s and the hardware and control software are no longer supported by Horiba.

The small business size standard is $14M.  Teaming arrangements, joint ventures and mentor-prot g e arrangements must be in accordance with the Small Business Administration and approved prior to submission of proposals.  Small Business firms are reminded under FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (Part C), that by submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the offeror/contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a service contract at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.<br><br>PROJECT INFORMATION:  Using best value acquisition procedures and in accordance with FAR part 15, the intent of the Government is to award one Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract consisting of one base year and two (2) option years with a total maximum dollar limitation of approximately $3,000,000.00 including options.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum dollar limitation.  The minimum guarantee will be $1,500.00.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  To determine best value, the Government's proposal evaluations will consist of, but not be limited to, evaluation of the offerors technical and management capabilities as well as price.  Potential offerors are reminded to pay particular attention to the Evaluation and Award Criteria set forth in Section L and Section M of the solicitation.  Technical proposals will be evaluated for 1) Expertise and Past Experience; 2) Experience and Qualifications of Personnel; 3) Location of Firm and Ability to Meet Work Schedule; 4) Past Performance; and 5) Price proposals.  The Government intends to award without discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br><br>Work consists of core drilling, soil sampling, and laboratory testing.  The intent of the work is to determine the type, nature, and characteristics of the subsurface materials at existing and proposed project sites under investigation by the United States Government, principally the U.S. Army Engineer District, Galveston, Corps of Engineers, Galveston, Texas.

<DESC><p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The objective of this contract is to provide Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Architectural Engineering services are required to support the Department of Defense Medical (DoDM) program Medical Facilities A-E Services (MFAES) requirements throughout the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS). Huntsville Center is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Medical Facilities Mandatory Center of Expertise and Standardization (MX), and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide medical expertise and the highest quality medical and medical research facility life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and foreign governments. The A-E contracts are intended to provide a variety of A-E services to include but not limited to: planning, survey, energy conservation and analyses studies, and other investigations/studies; comprehensive interior designs; development of Request For Proposal (RFP); and design services related to new construction, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of various medical facilities, including related infrastructure systems, medical equipment planning and components worldwide. The design of complex healthcare related facilities and laboratories is an integral part of this requirement. The CEHNC Design Manual (CEHNC 1110-1-1) and Unified Facilities Criteria for Medical Military Facilities (UFC 4-510-01) detail the specific design standards and processes associated with this acquisition for planning, design, construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria. In addition, the UFC Antiterrorism Force Protection Standards must be followed. The A-E firms must be able to provide design considerations for facilities related to healthcare planning. Work may include preparation of design tools, design criteria documents, studies, cost estimates (parametric and quantity take off), interim life safety plans, commissioning plans, facility demolition plans that include hazardous waste identification and removal procedures, concept designs, final designs, construction phase services, and technical review of designs prepared by others. Contractors must have the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.

<p>In order to accomplish this objective, the Huntsville Center proposes to award Unrestricted, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) with a portion of the awards reserved for small business concerns. The intent is to award contracts to six responsible firms, three large and three small businesses (SB). However, the Government reserves the right to award more, less or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The awards will be for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders (TOs) will be negotiated. The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MFAES requirement is anticipated to equal approximately $249,000,000 over a potential duration of five (5) years.</p>

However, if the TO is not reserved for SB firms they will still be considered for award with the entire unrestricted suite. In accordance with FAR 52.219-14, at least 50% of the work is required by employees of the prime contractor on a contract reserved for small business.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction design-build contracts or any TO that relate to any A-E TO awarded under this contract.

<p>In accordance with FAR Part 16.505(a)(8)(ii) and DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.</p>
<p>Studies and designs will be prepared in the English and/or metric system of measurement. Cost estimates will be prepared on IBM-compatible personal computers using Corps of Engineers' Computer Aided Cost Estimating System: software provided by the Government, M II Cost Estimating System, or similar approved software. Design drawings will be produced in a format fully compatible with the latest versions of Microstation and AutoCAD at time of contract award. Knowledge and experience with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and other sustainable design &amp; energy conservation legislation is desirable.</p>
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for the basic IDIQ contract are listed below in descending order of importance (first by primary criterion and then by each sub-criterion)." Criteria (1) through (5) are primary. Criteria (6) and (7) are secondary and will only be used as a "tie-breaker" among firms that are essentially technically equal. Price will not be used as a criterion.</p>
<p>1. Specialized Corporate Experience and Technical Competence: The firms shall provide examples of three to five complete projects by either the prime firm or key subcontractor that demonstrate relevant experience in medical facility designs for the following sub-criteria. For projects that led to construction (such as a design for construction or renovation), the construction must be complete. Construction complete is defined as having achieved the Beneficial Occupancy Date (BOD). The prime firm and key subcontractors (i.e. any subcontract which equals 10% or more of the prime contract) should have experience working together. The prime shall submit letters of commitment signed by key subcontractors. The prime shall also submit letters of commitment for key personnel not currently employed by the prime or key subcontractor(s). SUB CRITERIA: (1) Recent experience (i.e. performed within the past ten (10) years for Large and Small Business, from the release of this announcement) of the firm in design of New and /or addition/alteration of Medical facilities, laboratories (research, animal, clinical, Bio Safety Labs (BSL), dental clinics, medical clinics, renovation of existing medical facilities, support functions of medical facilities (power, water, steam), medical storage facilities, and medical transition spaces. Projects completed at Department of Defense, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Energy and federal government medical facilities will be considered more relevant than projects outside of the federal government. These examples should also demonstrate the design firms' ability to incorporate Evidence Based Design principles into medical facility designs, as well as Sustainable Design Development (SDD) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) concept into medical facility designs to achieve federally mandated standards and energy goals. (2) Demonstrate experience in the development of Interim Life Safety Measures and Infection Control Risk Mitigation design elements for medical facility renovation or additions. (3) The firm shall demonstrate experience in developing Requests for Proposals (RFPs). (4) Design quality management approach. Specifically, how will the firm maintain the quality of the design, cost control and what system is in place to assure the design quality is maintained. Provide a comprehensive description of how the Quality Control process will be executed including designation of the primary professionals who, apart from the key personnel design team members, will be responsible for quality review. UFC 4-510-01 and CEHNC 1110-1-1 details the specific requirements associated with this acquisition.<br />2. Professional Qualifications: The submitting firm must demonstrate that they are permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture and/or engineering work in at least one state, territory, or jurisdictions of the United States as required by FAR 36.601-4(b). The firm shall identify the professional qualifications and credentials of key personnel in the disciplines shown below that will be necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services. The lead architect or engineer in each discipline must be registered or certified to practice in the appropriate professional field and must have medical facility planning and design experience. The Government will consider the qualifications, experience, and training of licensed, registered, and/or certified key personnel. The evaluation of personnel will consider education, certifications, training, registration, length of time with the primary firm, overall and relevant experience, and specialized experience as required above. In addition, if a subcontractor to the primary firm, how long worked together and what part did they play in each of the relevant projects the firm provided as examples of their experience. Resumes shall be provided in Section E for the following key personnel: Project Manager (Architect or Engineer), Architect, Electrical Engineer, Mechanical Engineers (with specialized experience in HVAC, Plumbing and Medical Gas), Cost Estimator, Structural Engineer, Fire Protection Engineer (may be Mechanical Engineer with Fire Protection Certifications), must be registered or certified to practice in the appropriate professional field. Resumes shall be provided in Section E for the following personnel that are not required to be registered or certified to practice in their fields: Medical Facility Planner, Communications Professional, Security/Force Protection Specialist, Commissioning Specialist, Interior Designer, Industrial Hygienist, Hazardous Materials Specialist. The resume for each of the above key personnel shall be provided in Section E must identify (1) at least one state, territory, or jurisdiction in the United States in which their registration is current and include their individual license number and (2) their qualifications and credentials that are relevant to the satisfactory performance of the services required herein. A resume shall be provided for the lead Cost Estimator who should have construction cost estimating experience. A resume should be provided for a LEED Accredited Professional (AP), which may be one of the personnel identified above. Any key personnel who are not currently employed by the prime, consultant, or joint venture identified in the SF-330 must provide a signed letter of commitment that must accompany their resume. The firm must state any key personnel who will have dual responsibilities. The Government will consider the qualifications, education, overall and relevant experience, and training of key personnel and longevity with the firm of the key management and technical personnel.<br />3. Past Performance: The firm shall provide three to five references that best represent the past performance of the prime firm and any key subcontractors on recent (i.e. completed within the past ten (10) years for Large Businesses and Small Businesses from the release of this announcement) contracts for Medical facilities or projects relevant in size, scope and similarity to the services being procured under this synopsis with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. These projects should be relative or the same projects submitted under Criterion 1. Projects may include those with the Federal Government, State or local Governments, or commercial customers. Each contract reference contacted will be evaluated to determine if it is relevant and recent, and if so, the quality of the firm's past performance will be assessed. Risk ratings shall be completed for each Past Performance element. Past Performance Risk Ratings assess the risks associated with the firm's likelihood of success in performing the requirements stated in the synopsis based on the firm's demonstrated performance on recent contracts. <br /><br />Attached to this solicitation is a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment 1). The submitting firm is responsible for forwarding the questionnaire to each past performance reference submitted under this synopsis. Firms should complete Blocks 1-4 of the PPQ and the client/customer complete Blocks 5-8 and the evaluation survey. The client/customer should return the PPQ to the firm to be submitted with the SF330.</p>
<p>The Government will also query the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and other sources for all prime firms to assess performance risk. Performance evaluations for any key subcontractors may also be considered. The Government may elect to consider any credible information obtained from other sources in addition to those identified by the firm if adequate information is not available in PPIRS. In the event that adverse past performance information is obtained from other sources, the firm will have the opportunity to respond to any adverse information received which it had not had a previous opportunity to comment. If sufficient past performance data cannot be obtained from the questionnaires, PPIRS, other sources or the firm has no past performance record, the firm will be given an "Unknown Risk" or "Neutral" rating.<br /><br />4. Capacity: Firms competing shall demonstrate capacity or an effective organization structure, project team and quality management plan to accomplish up to an estimated five task orders simultaneously, with values ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000 each, in a one year period of time for the unrestricted respondents and three task orders simultaneously, with values ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000 each, in one year period of time for the restricted small business respondents. <br />5. OCONUS &amp; CONUS Capability: Capability to perform work Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) and throughout the Contiguous United States (CONUS), District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions. Firms should demonstrate their capability to perform work in multiple geographic locations. Greater consideration will be given to the A-E firms with the capability to perform work in diverse locations rather than only having experience in one geographic area. <br />Secondary Selection Criteria<br />6. Small Business Participation: Extent of participation of small businesses in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort. Firms competing shall provide detailed plans for small business subcontractors. The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition will be evaluated. The plan should detail the firm's best effort of proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof. <br />7.

This project builds transient billeting that replaces deteriorating housing currently used by 80 CJSOTF personnel at Camp Brown.  Existing housing is inadequate for continued use and this project supports CJSOTF personnel including the transition and enduring missions.  <br>    <br>   	FY12 Administrative Building at Camp Brown on KAF: Construct a 1075m  concrete masonry unit (CMU).  This project provides an administrative facility equipped with workspace for 37 administrative personnel who support CJSOTF operations throughout Afghanistan.  This new facility will provide the consolidation of staff by relocating them from use of multiple substandard buildings.  The consolidation process will increase efficiency of the support staff at Camp Brown.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Additional Requirements:  The contractor must be licensed to conduct business in Afghanistan.

The performance period will be 330 days from issuance of Notice to Proceed (NTP).  The magnitude of this construction project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C.  2805, the proposed price for each distinct project, inclusive of options items, cannot exceed the UMMC threshold of $1.75M.  Proposals exceeding the threshold are un-awardable.  <br>    <br>  Central Asian States (CAS) Initiative:  One of the factors in which offerors will be evaluated against is their level of participation in the US Government's Central Asian States Initiative program (reference Section 801 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-084), Temporary Authority to Acquire Products or Services Along a Major Route of Supply to Afghanistan).  More weight will be given to those offerors who support the initiative by purchasing materials from the specified CAS countries.

, Chantilly, VA 20151-2273 US
<DESC>To provide a fully functional and operational training center for USAID's employee's USAID requires the brand name A/V equipment that integrates with the current USAID training center infrastructure.
<p>An A/V design package was provided by USAID's A/V contractor Design Firm. It contained a total A/V solution that took into account products that would be compatible with the existing A/V equipment within the USAID inventory and also be compatible with USAID's A/V cabinetry.</p>
<p>Basically, in designing a fully functional turn-key A/V solution, contracgtor selected component parts that are compatible with one another in order to ensure 100% reliability of the system.  While some of the parts appear to be simple, their dimensions, wire connectors, weight bearing capacity and other features make them critical components of a functional system.  Replacing these parts would have a ripple effect and other more sophisticated components would have to be switched.  This will result in a system not compliant with USAID's existing systems and cabinetry.</p>
<p>With respect to the cabinetry, Middle Atlantic offers A/V cabinets that are finished in wood panels that can be matched to most solid wood furniture and for that reason are desirable and costly.  These cabinets have pre-drilled grommets and pre-installed fans that cool the A/V equipment.  In addition to the previously mentioned effects on the technical components, replacing parts would force the replacement of the Middle Atlantic cabinets or require prohibitive alterations to the cabinets, which would also void the warranties.</p>
<p>Essentially, the A/V solution was designed with specific products in mind and any alteration could negatively affect the A/V system's functionality and jeopardize the product warranties. USAID will coordinate the integration of its newly purchased training center furniture with the A/V equipment to complete it new training center</p>
<p>Market Research was performed by USAID's A/V contractor design firm. The products selected were the only available products that could meet the requirements for USAID's A/V solution. The market research substantiates the products being essential to the A/V solution.</p>
<p>Cost savings are realized by using identical components and reducing the burden of maintaining multiple technologies.</p>

<DESC>The Norfolk District requires the support of a private contractor to perform emergency surveys and data processing to determine the possible impacts to navigation from Hurricane Sandy. The Norfolk District intends to utilize the contractor to supplement surveys done by its government survey teams, thus enabling the District to identify critical shoaling or other obstructions to navigation channels that may exist in a timely fashion so as to complete the District's responsibilities and not negatively impact navigation or potentially damage life or property. The contractor will perform emergency surveys as directed by the District's Navigation Support and Surveying Section (NSSS). The scope will be limited to performing only emergency surveys necessary to complete the Norfolk District's responsibilities for determining possible impacts to navigation from Hurricane Sandy.
