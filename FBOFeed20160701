<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source

<CONTACT>Kelsie M. Cooley, Phone 9375224581, Email kelsie.cooley@us.af.mil
<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Stryker Spine instruments and implants system for a multi-level PLF surgery.<br /><br />The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard for NAICS 339113 is 750 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is Buffalo Supply Inc., 1650 Coal Creek Dr. Ste A, Lafayette, CO, 80026-8867. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Tuesday, 5 July 2016, 1:00 P.M. EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the Stryker Spine instruments and implants system for a multi-level PLF surgery. The Stryker Spine System is the only system that the Ortho spine Surgeon is trained on for this type of spinal surgery.
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov. <br /><br />Any information should be e-mailed to kelsie.cooley@us.af.mil no later than Tuesday, 5 July 2016, 1:00 P.M. EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered. <br /><br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "Stryker Spine System." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Pediatric Oncology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis the services for the manufacture of a GMP lot of Lentiviral vector CD19/CD22 bi CAR gene for clinical use from Lentigen Technology Inc.; 910 Clopper Road, Suite 200 S; Gaithersburg, MD 20878. <br /><br />The response close date of this notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 352413 and the business size standard is 1,250 employees.
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price, type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance: delivery will be twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI, CCR is committed to bringing new cutting edge therapies to children with leukemia. The POB has been instrumental in treating children with T-lymphocytes (white blood cells from the patient) that have been modified with retroviral gene vectors. It currently has an open clinical trial for T-cells modified with a CAR specific for the leukemia tumor antigen C019.</p>
<p>The gene vector for CD19-CAR was produced by the NCI Surgery Branch. The POB's recent research has identified that another leukemia tumor antigen, CD22, is also a high value target and have validated activity in an ongoing clinical trial in the POB. Importantly loss of CD19 has been observed as a mechanism for leukemic resistance. The POB has developed a CAR construct that targets both CD19 and C022 and is based on the C019 and CD22 single targeting CARs used in clinical trials in the POB.</p>
<p>This requirement is for the production of GMP-grade, fully tested lentiviral CD19/CD22 bispecific CAR vector. The creation of gene vectors, and especially what the POB entails here, a GMP grade, high-titer vector that can be qualified for subsequent clinical use, is not normally a commercial enterprise. Lentigen Technology, Inc. has a track record of consistently producing such vector in a clinic-ready manner. The overall objective of this proposal is to provide the NCI CCR POB Investigators with GMP compliant production and testing services. Material will be produced under Standard Operating Procedures to be compliant with FDA regulations for the eventual generation of Phase 1/11 clinical material.</p>
<p>Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:<br />The Contractor shall provide the Investigators of the NCI CCR POB with a lentiviral vector CD19/CD22 biCAR gene following cGMP standards. Material must be produced under Standard Operating Procedures to be compliant with FDA regulations for Phase I/II clinical material.</p>

<RESPDATE>071116
<CONTACT>Kevin Alvarez , Contract Specialist, Email kevin.alvarez@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Fenwal, Inc., 3 Corporate Drive Suite 300, Lake Zurich, IL, 60047-8930, to provide an Amicus apheresis machine to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Hematology Branch (HB).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Hematopoiesis, the development and differentiation of stem cells into multiple types of blood cells, occurs throughout life and its dysfunction is associated with low blood counts or leukemia. The lab's research focuses on understanding the process of hematopoiesis in vivo, as well as on optimizing and improving the safety of gene transfer into primary hematopoietic cells for therapeutic purposes. The lab's goals are synergistic: insight into the control of hematopoiesis is required to successfully manipulate and genetically modify hematopoietic cells; conversely, genetic marking of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells has provided novel insights into lineage relationships, stem cell dynamics, and stem cell numbers in vivo that are applicable to gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, and other clinical interventions.</p>
<p>For over twenty years, the laboratory has had the privilege of utilizing a rhesus macaque transplantation model. The facility is one of only a handful worldwide able to successfully support non-human primates through stem cell transplantation. This model provides unique and highly relevant insights into hematopoiesis and has resulted in successful optimization of gene and cell therapy approaches later translated successfully into human clinical trials. The proposed acquisition will give the lab enhanced ability to perform small volume apheresis procedures that are high risk and require careful balance between hemodynamic fluid and anti-coagulation monitoring.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure an Amicus apheresis machine that will allow the lab to continue performing research for protocol H-0136R3 (Gene transfer into non-human primate hematopoietic cells). In order to release primitive CD34+ hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow into peripheral blood an apheresis must be performed.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following equipment:</p>
<p>&bull;	Amicus Device for MNC and TPE<br />&bull;	Amicus Mononuclear Cell Kit (MNC) (x6)</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>Through the market research performed, we have determined that Fenwal, Inc. is the only vendor currently offering an apheresis machine that meets all of the capability requirements of the Hematology Branch. Moreover, the branch up until now has used a Fenwal, Inc. apheresis machine to perform procedures under a clinical protocol. It is imperative that the lab purchase a similar machine in order to maintain continuity and the integrity of their data.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-88 (June 15th, 2016).</p>

<CONTACT>Kevin Alvarez , Contract Specialist, Email kevin.alvarez@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Thomas Dean Stephens, 1701 6th Street NW Apt A, Washington, DC, 20001-2448, to provide the services of a theoretical biophysicist to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The lab has theoretically proved that the current conventional theoretical framework is incapable of depicting the dynamics of complex membrane shape-changes involving the large membrane curvature and intertwined tubules structures such as those in ER and Golgi. This is because the current theories always assume certain symmetry of the membrane shape, which is always violated in reality. On the other hand, without assuming symmetry, degrees of freedom in the numerical simulation will be significantly increased. For a typical case of membrane trafficking with a linear dimension of microns, the degree of freedom can easily ramp up into the millions. However, as the lab has tried out, and realized last year, the current commercial finite element solvers are incapable of handling this many degrees of freedom. To truly describe these membrane-shape changes and discern physical mechanisms, which are central themes of the lab's research program, it requires a custom-made finite element algorithm and code. In order to develop such an algorithm and code, the lab must employ the services of a theoretical biophysicist to assist with computational research.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure the services of a theoretical biophysicist to work in computational research in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics. These services will give the lab an enhanced ability to compute the evolution of membrane shape-changes, and can potentially address long standing questions in the field by providing a unified framework about fundamental physical mechanisms of the complex membrane shape-changes in the mitochondria membrane, phagocytosis, and other membrane trafficking processes.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide services of a theoretical biophysicist to assist with computational research. This work will be performed 8 hours a day, five days a week, from 07/20/2016 through 04/19/2017, excluding Federal government holidays.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that this is a follow-on to an existing contract and Thomas Dean Stephens is currently providing the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics with these services. Due to his specific experience and expertise with the projects outlined above, only this specific contractor would be able to complete any significant fraction of the work within the project interval. If another contractor were to take over, there would not only be a lapse in services in order to train the new contractor on the processes and procedures of the lab, but there would be an expensive and duplicative investment in training. This loss of productivity and substantial duplication of costs is unacceptable to the Government.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $15.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-88 (June 15th, 2016).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 5.201 and 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and delays in service make competition impractical. Award is subject to Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approval. <br />This sole source acquisition will ensure research data consistency. The NIEHS intends to award a Purchase Order to FUJIFILM VisualSonics Corporation, at 21919 30th Drive, SE, Bothel, WA 98021, to acquire a Vevo 3100 Imaging System. <br />The North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. It has been determined that FUJIFILM VisualSonics Corporation is the only known responsible source capable of providing the required equipment and no other equipment will satisfy the agency's requirements.<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a Vevo 3100 ultrasound system. This system is specifically designed for rodents- and has a high enough resolution to obtain accurate images of the smaller rodent hearts, kidneys, uterus, and minute tumors which cannot be detected using a standard veterinary or human ultrasound device. The Vevo 3100 system's advanced capabilities make it unique in its ability to provide state of the art high resolution imaging with high-frequency linear array transducers operating over 20 MHz and designed specifically for small animals. High-frequency ultrasound provides high spatial resolution images up to 30 micrometers which will prove to be very beneficial to the researchers working with small animals. The Vevo 3100 system will replace a Vevo 770 due to obsolesce. Acquiring the Vevo 3100 will ensure no lost time- among researchers- in data collection for ongoing and future studies, related to existing data collected with the Vevo 770. Furthermore, because the data collected to date has been collected using Vevo 770, the same platform must be used in the future to be able to compare data from past studies. This can only be accomplished with software of the same manufacturer. Otherwise, data integrity and analysis is compromised. Accordingly, the determination has been made that FUJIFILM VisualSonics Corporation is the only vendor able to meet the requirement, as detailed above.<br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received within eleven days of this posting. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish capability to fulfill this requirement. NIEHS will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Please email responses with the solicitation number in the subject line to James E. Bryant, Jr., at bryant5@niehs.nih.gov.<br />Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

<SUBJECT>Reducing the Improvised Explosive Device Threat: An Integrated National Strategy for Reducing the Threat from Chemical Explosive Precursors. - INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<SOLNBR>PSC070116-NAS
<RESPDATE>071516
<CONTACT>Michele Namoski, Contract Specialist , Phone 301-443-3337, Email SHELLEY.NAMOSKI@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1 The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services, on behalf of the Department for Homeland Security (DHS), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a cost reimbursement order for each agency, under the PSC Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), for a study on "Reducing the Improvised Explosive Device Threat: An Integrated National Strategy for Reducing the Threat from Chemical Explosive Precursors."
<p><br />The Infrastructure Security Compliance Division (ISCD) was established in response to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act of 2007 (Public Law 109-295), which provided DHS with the authority to regulate chemical facilities that present a high level of security risk. In accordance with the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS), 6 CFR Part 27, ISCD's primary role is to secure our Nation's high-risk chemical facilities, mitigating chemical facility security risks through the systematic regulation, inspection, and enforcement of chemical infrastructure security requirements. In CFATS, ISCD works to execute a vital Ammonium Nitrate (AN) Security Program that aggressively promotes collaborative security planning with industry stakeholders. The AN Security Program proposes regulations to reduce the likelihood of a terrorist attack involving the use of ammonium nitrate, a chemical explosive precursor, in improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Several U.S. Government Presidential directives and reports including the Homeland Security Act of 2002, National Strategy for Homeland Security, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 19, have identified the need and set forth requirements for the U.S. to prepare for terrorist threats and attacks against the homeland. These threats and attacks include the use of other chemical explosive precursors, such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium nitrate, in homemade explosives or IEDs. <br /><br />In 1998, the Academy's National Research Council (NRC) published a study entitled Containing the Threat of Illegal Bombings: An Integrated National Strategy for Marking, Tagging, Rendering Inert, and Licensing Explosives and their Precursors. This study resulted directly from a Congressional mandate to the Department of the Treasury (DOT) in the Antiterrorism Act of 1996, which called for DOT to work with the National Academy of Sciences on this topic. In that study, conducted in the aftermath of the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, a "short list" of chemicals and precursors of highest priority concern was developed and recommendations were made for limiting and controlling their availability for potential illegal use. The results of the study were later incorporated in a DHS rulemaking on CFATS in 2007. <br /><br />Today, 18 years later, the threat-space of IEDs has changed significantly, including changes in availability of materials and know-how and changes in the primary actors of concern and their motives and methods. The knowledge has also increased with the collection of data on bombings that have occurred since the 1998 study. Further, the DHS is responsible for the development and application of relevant knowledge, technologies, tools, and science applications to protect the nation from terrorist threats and attacks, as well as man-made and natural disasters. Congressional Appropriators and the Office of Management and Budget have provided funding to research IED precursor chemicals in relation to its prospective AN Security Program. <br /><br />The NAS/NRC is an independent, not for profit organization that works outside of government to provide unbiased and authoritative advice to decision makers and the public. For more than 140 years, the National Academies have been advising the nation on issues of science, technology, and medicine; ever since an 1863 Congressional charter signed by President Lincoln authorized this non-governmental institution to honor top scientists with membership and to serve the nation whenever called upon. The NAS/NRC unique approach to studies ensures that Federal Agencies receive independent and authoritative advice. Checks and balances exist at every step to protect the integrity of the reports and to maintain public confidence in their findings. They have the unique ability to assemble the Nation's most eminent scholars and other experts, who are appointed by the President of the Academy to provide their expertise without compensation on committees and boards, which render advice and guidance of the highest quality and unparalleled objectivity to address national issues of high priority. <br /><br />Accordingly, the NRC is uniquely qualified to provide the measure of expertise, independence, and objectivity necessary to meet the Department of Homeland Security's requirement for a study&nbsp;tentatively entitled "Reducing the Improvised Explosive Device Threat: An Integrated National Strategy for Reducing the Threat from Chemical Explosive Precursors." &nbsp;In this study, the NRC will analyze the current landscape with respect to the availability and usage of the chemical precursors to explosives used in IEDs. Subject Matter Experts including, but not limited to the nation's foremost scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts to address the scientific and technical aspects of IED precursor chemicals. The NRC will update the list of precursors of greatest concern based on knowledge of current and future threats and current and projected commerce in these chemicals, and will provide a risk-informed strategy for controlling illegal use of chemical precursors. Specifically The committee shall 1.) Extend the work described in the report entitled "Containing the Threat from Illegal Bombings: An Integrated National Source for Marking, Tagging, Rendering Inert, and Licensing Explosives and Their Precursors" which was published in 1998. Specifically, the work will update and expand on the information presented in Chapter 5 of the report, "Limiting Criminal Access to Explosives and Precursor Chemicals." 2.)

<DESC><p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone (CCAM-RDI), Fort Eustis, VA, intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", with L-3 Aviation Communication &amp; Surveillance Systems, LLC (CAGE Code 1WYD3), 19810 N. 7th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85027, to purchase eight (8) Electronic Standby Instrument System (ESIS)GH-3900-series Displays, Part Number 501-1851-01, for the MH-60 Black Hawk Helicopter into an already-approved Common Avionics Architecture Suite (CAAS) cockpit configuration.</p>
<p>REASON AUTHORITY CITED<br />L-3 Aviation Communication &amp; Surveillance Systems, LLC, owns the proprietary rights for the ESIS Displays. L-3 Aviation Communication &amp; Surveillance Systems, LLC is the original equipment manufacturer and only authorized vendor able to sell and modify the ESIS Displays. L-3 developed the ESIS Displays at private expense and has no interest in selling these rights to the Government at this time. The Government does not own sufficient rights to the data to allow open competition. No other type of hardware or component can satisfy the government's need due to the unique configuration of this air data computer that is (a) designed into the CAAS and (b) qualified and approved for use under a Department of the Army (DA) Air Worthiness Release (AWR). In addition, award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities statements or proposals received prior to the closing date set in this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>Request for Information</p>
<p><br />Advancing Economic Development in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) via Commercial Use of Limited Availability, Unique International Space Station Capabilities</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will take action in this matter. NASA is investigating options and approaches to expedite commercial activity in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Specifically, NASA is looking to increase private sector demand for space research and expand on the work of Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), the manager of the ISS National Laboratory. NASA is not only interested in technical solutions to advance these goals, but also in contract or agreement structures that potential offerors would see as beneficial to advance private sector demand for low Earth orbit research. NASA does not have unique funds for this activity. Respondents are also requested to address International Space Station (ISS) resource access along with commercial market demand and private funding considerations. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation or an update to an existing solicitation is developed from this RFI it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>This RFI is being used to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability in order to advance economic development in LEO. NASA will use the results of this RFI to guide development of a possible future announcement of opportunity appropriate to the Agency's objective of fostering a self-sustaining commercial marketplace in LEO. NASA is seeking industry ideas to stimulate economic development through the use of unique ISS capabilities such as unused common berthing mechanism (CBM) attachment ports, non-standard attachment sites or any other capability which can be used in a way not previously envisioned. NASA is also interested in operating approaches.</p>
<p>In April 2016, NASA issued a Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, an omnibus announcement covering all aspects of basic and applied supporting research and technology for human space exploration and robotic precursor activities. The April release of the NextSTEP-2 BAA included Appendix A: Habitat Systems, which is focused on developing long duration, deep space habitation concepts, resulting in ground prototype units. The NextSTEP BAA is seeking proposals specifically for deep space that could also advance commercial LEO habitation capabilities. Unlike NextSTEP-2, this RFI is strictly seeking information on potential commercial LEO activities which leverage the ISS as a platform, regardless of the application to deep space human exploration objectives.</p>
<p>Unique Capabilities which are Available:</p>
<p>Some capabilities on the ISS are available for immediate use while others may currently be in use but can be made available. Unique capabilities that could be made available include:</p>
<p>&bull; Currently available</p>
<p>&nbsp;o Common Berthing Mechanism ports, if the user provides equivalent capability to maintain ISS functionality</p>
<p>&nbsp;o Trunnion Pins</p>
<p>&nbsp;o Other unique interfaces or capabilities of the ISS as suggested by the offeror</p>
<p>&bull; Available in the future</p>
<p>&nbsp;o Common Berthing Mechanism attachment site at Node 3 Aft</p>
<p>Funds Available to Enable the Partnership(s):</p>
<p>NASA's budget does not include any dedicated funding to enable partnership(s) for use of these limited availability, unique capabilities. However, if warranted, ISS budget may be available to cover the ISS integration work required to enable use of these capabilities.</p>
<p>Information Requested from Responders:</p>
<p>NASA is interested in understanding the following information from responders:</p>
<p>&bull; Unique ISS capabilities the responder is interested in with a description of proposed use.</p>
<p>&bull; Need dates and minimum durations that the capability would be required.</p>
<p>&bull; How this activity will advance economic development and private sector demand for research in space. Results of market studies, if available.</p>
<p>&bull; Suggested approaches for NASA to evaluate the plans for achieving and maintaining an appropriate balance between the responders' commercial objectives and the Agency's broader objectives of advancing economic development and private sector demand for research in space.</p>
<p>&bull; Minimum criteria to be met in order to retain on-going use of the capability and timelines for terminating use of the capabilities if ongoing evaluation indicates the use of the capability is no longer meeting the minimum criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; How the offeror plans to fund and sustain their asset on ISS. What is the business case to sustain the asset after ISS end of life?</p>
<p>&bull; How the offeror plans to obtain crew or cargo transportation, if required? If the offeror expects to obtain these or other resources through NASA or CASIS, please indicate the magnitude of resources expected.</p>
<p>&bull; Suggestion of ways NASA can incentivize a partner to stimulate economic development in LEO with minimal to no unique NASA direct investment.</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of specific barriers to proposed commercial use of these capabilities.</p>
<p>&bull; A discussion on how this activity would intersect with the CASIS role to foster use of the National Laboratory and how CASIS could best support your efforts. http://www.iss-casis.org/About/AboutCASIS.aspx</p>
<p>Activity Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>Responders are invited to provide suggestions on what terms and conditions are beneficial for industry and NASA for these partnerships.</p>
<p>Specific Requests:</p>
<p>&bull; Describe your preferred transaction type (Space Act Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, no-cost contract, other) with rationale.</p>
<p>&bull; Specify any government furnished equipment, facilities, and/or services that would be needed by the responder to enter into an appropriate transaction for use of the unique capability requested.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify fund raising and development milestones that the responder would need to achieve to meet their part of the activity. Include the dependencies between any critical government commitments (equipment delivery, facilities usage or services such as unique analysis) that are required to enable the responder to meet these milestones.</p>
<p>&bull; Specify any specific intellectual property clauses, marketing or advertising agreements, or other conditions that are required to enable the responder to meet their part of the activity.</p>
<p>&bull; Suggest any variances or changes to the ISS Code of Conduct needed for the future partnership. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2013-title14-vol5/pdf/CFR-2013-title14-vol5-sec1214-403.pdf</p>
<p>Company Information:</p>
<p>&bull; Company name, point of contact name, phone number, e-mail address.</p>
<p>&bull; Major economic development activities underway related to stimulating a commercial marketplace in LEO, if any.</p>
<p>Response Preparation and Transmittal:</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. It is not a procurement, commitment to procure items or services, or request for proposals. NASA will not reimburse any costs incurred for preparation or submission of information in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>NASA reserves the right to share all information received in response to this RFI throughout NASA and to use all information submitted in response to this RFI in NASA's formulation of one or more partnerships for or related to the stimulation of economic development activities in LEO. NASA does not wish to receive any competition sensitive data that requires protection. However, if it is necessary to submit competition sensitive data to answer any of the questions in this RFI that data should be clearly segregated and marked as sensitive. Although information contained herein represents current program content and acquisition planning, it is subject to change.</p>
<p>Questions and responses shall reference this RFI. Interested parties should submit a response of no more than 20 single-sided pages indicating their interest as described herein. A cover page may be added in addition to the 20 pages.</p>
<p>Point of Contact:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Semiconductor and Dimensional Metrology Division (SDMD) provides leadership in conducting research&nbsp;in the areas of dimensional, nanometer-scale, surface, and acoustic pressure metrology, accelerometry, silicon Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), power electronics, nanoelectronics, and flexible/printed electronics.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The atom based laboratory is developing the capability for fabricating atomic scale devices based on atomically precise lithography and selective dopant placement. The preparation chamber in one of the ultra-high vacuum systems is being modified to incorporate a thin film deposition system for monitoring and controlling the Si sublimation epitaxial overgrowth to encapsulate the dopant layer of phosphorous in silicon. The deposition system will also help us to perform epitaxial growth experiments to optimize parameters for quality overlayer growth. To meet this objective, NIST is seeking sources capable of providing a silicon sublimation source to evaporate silicon from an intrinsic silicon filament.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Flow and Imaging Cytometry Core Facility (The Facility) provides technical, collaborative and new application research and development support to NINDS and other intramural investigators in both basic and clinical research programs requiring the use of highly multiplexed and high-throughput conventional flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, preparative fluorescence-activated cell sorting and in situ cytometric imaging techniques.<br /> <br />The Facility has a current and future need to expand the scope of its established and continuously evolving flow cytometry bioassays by providing seamless cross-platform compatibility with comparable in situ cytometry bioassays used in field based microscopy applications and tailored to support highly multiplexed 2D and 3D immunohistology and systems biology research projects that are not amenable to using tissue dissociation and single-cell suspension preparations required by flow cytometry techniques. Acquisition of a state-of-the-art 20-color confocal, 30-color wide-field fluorescence and full-color bright field digital slide scanner with integrated software optimized for high resolution multiplexed 3D imaging of thick tissue slices and intact specimens (including whole mouse and rat brains) processed with tissue clearing methods and for 2D imaging of thin serial tissue slices for array tomography applications and large specimen scans (including monkey and human whole brain sections), will enable seamless use of these technologies in porting the existing multiplexed bioassays currently developed for flow cytometry applications to be fully compatible with 2D and 3D immunohistology imaging applications, as well as facilitate future development of new multiplexed in situ imaging bioassays tailored to continuously evolving investigator interests and needs. The Facility currently supports over 120 basic and clinical research projects in 42 NINDS and other intramural programs across 14 NIH intramural institutes and centers and the acquired confocal and wide-field fluorescence and full-color bright field imaging scanner with fully integrated and automated software for image acquisition and analysis will be an invaluable shared resource to all NINDS and other intramural investigators planning to carry out their systems biology, 2D and 3D histology, array tomography, whole brain imaging and in situ cytometry experiments at this Facility.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY The Government is currently conducting market research to gather information and identify potential sources for the requirement identified below. A solicitation is not available at this time, and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.
<p>National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, in support of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), seeks potential vendors in examining stock structure of harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in Southeast Alaska through environmental DNA (eDNA)<br />NOAA is to conduct a genetic study of the regional population structuring of harbor porpoise within Southeast Alaska using eDNA extracted from seawater samples. This study will expand on the results of a pilot study conducted in this area during 2015 to explore the feasibility of using eDNA samples to genetically detect harbor porpoise. The proposed genetic investigations and expected results of the study are provided below. Various collaborators will be involved in this project including staff members from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, and individuals responsible for the collection of the samples. The contractor will be responsible for coordinating with ongoing research efforts and contribute to all aspects of study design, sample collection strategy, development of taxon-specific genetic markers, genetic sequencing and data analysis.<br />The Marine Mammal Laboratory (MML) requires that the contractor further optimize genetic markers suitable for use with low detection eDNA samples targeting highly variable regions of the harbor porpoise mitochondrial genome. The contractor must be familiar with stringent protocols for handling samples that typically yield very low quantity/quality DNA, and a variety of molecular genetic procedures including Sanger sequencing, and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). The contractor will be required to draw upon established collaborations with NWFSC to ensure consistency with the quality controls implemented during the pilot study.<br />In addition to mitochondrial markers, the contractor is expected to explore possible nuclear genetic markers that may be informative for population genetic structuring analyses and identification of hybrid porpoise. Laboratory protocols shall be consistent with those currently employed at NWFSC and SWFSC. A researcher whose experience in this field is known by both Agency staff and independent cetacean researchers in Alaska is necessary to expedite this research and ensure the overall success of the project. <br />A better understanding of the structure and definition of harbor porpoise populations in Alaska is key to reliably interpreting existing and future data on by-catch, abundance, and trends in this region. Genetic studies exploiting novel sources of porpoise DNA offer the best means of obtaining such information within a relatively short time-frame. This work will lay the foundation for further assessments. <br />This contract will require 5.5 months of a salaried position for a Ph.D. research scientist with expertise in both cetacean ecology and molecular genetics. The contractor will generate molecular genetic data as detailed above. This contract will involve collaborative research among researchers at MML, SWFSC, NWFSC, and the Vancouver Aquarium research group. <br />Please provide the following information as requested:</p>
<p>1) A statement that you believe that your firm has the capability to meet these requirements and perform these services. Please include relevant experience and other pertinent information that demonstrates your ability to complete the requirement.</p>
<p>2) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;</p>
<p>3) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is a small business, HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned or SBA 8(a) program certified;</p>
<p>All information received in response to this notice shall be treated as Business Sensitive or confidential to the responder, exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The response date for this request for information is no later than COB July 08, 2016. No collect calls will be accepted. All responses may be submitted via e-mail to Diana Romero, Purchasing Agent, at diana.romero@noaa.gov. The phone number for the Purchasing Agent is (303) 497-3761.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in July.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for July is July 1, 2016 to July 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the new RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   <br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and certain counties in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in July 2016.
<p><strong>HOW TO OFFER:</strong> The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p><strong>The Open Period:</strong> for July is July 1, 2016 to July 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p><strong>OCCUPANCY:</strong> Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br /><strong>DELINEATED AREA:</strong> Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br /><strong>LEASE TERM:</strong> Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>This special notice is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) portal located at http://www.nac-dotc.org. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command's Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM ARDEC) will sponsor an Armaments Collaboration Industry Day tentatively scheduled for 20-21 Sept 2016 to provide detailed conceptual approach, technical information and requirements associated with the development of Platform-Agnostic (PA) Multi-Role Armament Systems (MRAS). It is intended for these next generation systems to be suitable for full spectrum of operations in Land, Sea, and Air Warfare. System requirements will encompass weapon performance, fire control (aiming/ tracking /guidance/navigation), munition selection and loading, programmable munition fuzing and terminal effects, launch and propellants, networked fires, and training. Emphasis will be placed on defeating the widest spectrum of threats as opposed to platform-centric point solutions. This initiative is intended to establish a holistic integrated armament systems approach that provides the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and SOCOM (and potentially NATO) with advanced multi-mission capabilities without compromise or dependence on legacy compatibility. The desired end state will also yield a reduction in logistical burden, investment, and sustainment costs across DoD. Our purpose is to sponsor and build an armaments collaboration community that will result in ongoing two-way open communications among all of the stakeholders and provide Warfighters with next generation weaponry for unprecedented overmatch in all battle environments. The key focus of this first meeting in the armaments "Collaboratory" will be to exchange information and ideas in order to foster collaboration and teaming across Government, large businesses, small businesses, nontraditional Government contractors and academic institutions through technical breakout and one-on-one sessions.
<p>Areas of primary interest for technology insertion and systems solutions include: agile armament systems for kinetic and/or non-kinetic target defeat; extended range/multi-role weapons and munitions; directed energy weapons (DEW); and non-lethal weapons. Enablers will include: advanced sensors and fuzing; improved warheads; explosive formulations; novel Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) solutions; and technologies for Area Access/Area Denial (A2AD). All information presented during the Industry Day will be Distribution D.</p>
<p>This Armaments Collaboration Industry Day will inform attendees about the Government needs for an integrated Multi-Role Armament Systems and will be seeking conceptual and technological input from industry. The event will take place at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, or possibly a local venue depending upon the estimated number of attendees. The Government is contemplating including emerging requirements in the FY18 Request for Prototype Proposals (RPP) that will be issued through the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) for the National Armaments Consortium (NAC). A NAC membership will be required to respond to such RPPs. However, for this Industry Day, attendance is open to all U.S. Contractors and not limited to members of the NAC. Additionally, RDECOM ARDEC cordially invites representatives from the armaments communities of the other Services. We request that participants are able to represent the viewpoints of their respective organizations at an appropriate technical, leadership, and management level. More information on the DOTC and NAC can be found at www.nac-dotc.org.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to gain initial interest from industry and to assist with the planning phases of the event. Businesses/Organizations interested in attending should confirm through the following website http://surveys.ati.org/TakeSurvey.aspx?PageNumber=1&amp;SurveyID=ml1I6p5&amp;Preview=true, no later than 5pm EST, 10 August 2016 or as soon as possible with the following information: organization name, first and last name of individual attending (all attendees must be U.S. citizens), telephone number, e-mail address and mailing address.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7490-00-NIB-0049<br />Name:		Shredder, Cross-Cut, 17 Sheets, 10" Throat<br />Description:	Cross-cut shredder capable of shredding 17 sheets at a time through a 10" throat. Capacity is 14,000 sheets per day. Shredder has Level 4 security rating. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7490-00-NIB-0049<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	HSM 1030; HSM 1823, b32c; hsm1803, b26c</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than July 18, 2016 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with General Oceanics (GO), Inc., 1295 NW 163St, Miami, FL 33169 for one Autonomous Underway PCO2 Measuring System and spare parts for the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, FL.
<p>Background<br />Atlantic Oceanic and Meteorology Laboratory/Ocean Chemistry and Ecosystems Division/Ocean Carbon Cycle group requires the purchase of a GO-8050 autonomous underway pCO2 system to measure the partial pressure of CO2 of seawater and atmospheric air on board ships of opportunity. The Ocean Carbon Cycle group is one of five US partners (along with the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS)) to perform these measurements all over the world's oceans. Monitoring the pCO2 of the oceans is crucial for the understanding the role of the oceans has in global warming and for predicting, through modeling, the impact that human activities may have in the future on climate. These measurements are have been made by this group for almost two decades and are part of a unique dataset built by installing this instrument on board several ships of opportunity. Currently, the OCC grouph has 5 ships outfitted with this instrument, which has a estimated shelf life of about 5 years. It is essential that the data be continuously collected with a minimum of time gaps and to achieve this, we need to be able to replace aging systems. The only system which is less than 5 years old was purchased in 2014. The system purchased before last was bought in 2011 and is already 5 years old.</p>
<p>In addition to a full system, spare parts are also require various in order to keep older systems running properly. These systems are installed in very harsh environments, which are not kind to electronics and scientific equipment. These spare parts include equilibrators, pressure regulators, flow switches and pumps, among others.</p>
<p>A Sources Sought notice was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on June 17, 2016 and closed on June 27, 2016. No responses were received.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification<br />This scientific instrument is the result of a community effort to produce the best pCO2 system available. The principles were laid out by a group of leading scientist specialized in this type of measurements and a prototype was built. Once the concept had been tested, General Oceanics (GO) was contacted to build it commercially.</p>
<p>There are no other companies, which could provide a pCO2 system capable of measuring pCO2 with the same precision (+/- 2ppm for seawater and +/- 0.2 ppm for atmospheric air) and which could perform autonomously for several months while being regularly and automatically calibrated by 3 or more standard gases, regularly and automatically back-flushed with fresh water and alternate between seawater and atmospheric pCO2 measurements.</p>
<p>The purchase of the this system is supported by the necessity of compatibility with the five other systems previous procured, which are all from GO. Not only the data quality (the highest in the scientific community) will be comparable to the data collected from the systems already in the field but also, replacing the current systems with this new one with require no change in infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Government's mission is to monitor the surface pCO2 levels in the North Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico region to determine trends and variability in the oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide. The data ultimately feeds the models that allow the science community to make estimates on the earth global carbon budget, which is essential to global warming predictions. The data collection relies on 4-5 ships strategically chosen. If the equipment is not procured, the Government takes the risk of losing a significant percentage of the regional and temporal coverage, thus introducing significant errors in the ability to predict the system and affecting the information provided to the government to fight global warming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: small;">The Library of Congress owns and operates four (4) SAMMA robotic digitization platforms at the NAVCC in Culpeper, Virginia. One robotic system is dedicated to the digitization of VHS media using JVC BRS-DX822U VTRs. This robotic system (VHS Robot) requires a reconfiguration to use a different VTR due to the low availability of the JVC BRS-DX822U and the complexity of repairs on that machine. The VHS Robot will continue to be used for VHS digitization. The current VHS platform has a low availability for replacement playback decks and a high rate of failure.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) are continuing the process of modernizing and upgrading its television and radio broadcast and production systems in its Washington DC headquarters. The BBG requires support from contractors specializing in all aspects of television and radio broadcast systems, studio set design and fabrication and lighting design; and acquisition, installation and technical integration services. The majority of tasks assigned will be less than one million dollars. These tasks may be independent, or may augment other major projects in progress. It is anticipated that a significant amount of the work will be performed in the Washington, DC metro area; however the agency has bureaus within the continental United States that may need similar services.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE
<p>(a) The objective of this solicitation is to obtain broadcast technical services and equipment on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) - Task Order / Delivery Order (TO/DO) basis from qualified small business contractors based in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Although the primary supplies (e.g., equipment, sets, and systems) and services (engineering, design, training, logistics, or acquisition) required under this contract relate to television and radio production and on-air broadcasting, it must be noted that various portions of VOA's television and radio facilities consist of state-of-the-art, information technology (IT) based integrated digital broadcast systems.</p>
<p>(b) This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the types of task areas that will be referenced within each individual TO/DO. Each TO/DO will have its own unique SOW that will specify the work to be performed, the location or locations of the work, the schedule for completion of work, the deliverables, the acceptance criteria, and any special requirements related to that specific TO/DO. Each TO/DO will be competitively bid among the firms awarded this IDIQ Contract, and the Government will issue a Firm-Fixed-Price TO/DO prior to commencement of work on that TO/DO.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Part 1 - Description
<p>The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has a requirement for a High Performance Ion Mobility Spectrometer (HPIMS) that Utilizes both Electrospray and Thermal Desorber Sources and Sampling Interfaces.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quote (RFQ) using FAR Parts 12 and 13 procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-88. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. .  The associated small business standard is 500 employees.  This is for a small business set-aside.</p>

<p>The total price for the base and four option years is $____________.</p>
<p>Part 3 - Description/Specifications</p>
<p>3.1 Background</p>
<p>We request funds to purchase a high performance ion mobility spectrometer (HPIMS) that is capable of interfacing with both a direct/electrospray (ESI) ionization source and a thermal desorber sampling introduction system for the rapid analysis of complex drug products and biopharmaceutical drug products. Surveillance testing is one important component of the FDA quality drug monitoring program.  American consumers may be exposed to pharmaceutical products that have been counterfeited, contaminated, or mislabeled as a result of the globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and the large availability of drug products sold on the internet.  Current USP and laboratory testing methods are often laborious and time consuming to perform.</p>
<p>The ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) instrumentation currently utilized by DPA was developed for security screening applications it has several drawbacks limiting its use as a rapid screening tool for the identification of adulterants or substandard pharmaceutical products.  First, because the system uses thermal desorption for sample introduction, only volatile and semi-volatile compounds with low boiling points can be introduced into the spectrometer.  Consequently, thermally labile compounds, non-volatile compounds and biological samples cannot be analyzed using the current configuration.  Second, IMS instruments used for security screening are designed to target low molecular weight (MW) molecules.  At high MW, the samples are not volatile enough to be introduced into the IMS system.  Lastly, decomposition of labile molecules can occur during thermal desorption sample introduction.  Decomposition can generate complex ion mobility spectra and reduce the system sensitivity.  Thus, only a small percentage of drug molecules can be analyzed using the current IMS systems with thermal desorption methods for sample introduction.</p>
<p>The HPIMS unit requested can be configured with both a direct/electrospray (ESI) ionization source and a thermal desorber sampling introduction system.  The ESI source can be used to introduce and analyze a wide variety of drug products that vary in volatility and MW. Small drug molecules as well as large antibiotics and protein therapeutics have resulted in ion mobility signals useful for identification when using an IMS instrument configured with an ESI source.  In addition, this particular unit can also be configured to emulate the commercially available IMS instruments used in the security screening industry by swapping out the ESI source for a thermal desorber sample introduction accessory.  The Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis (DPA) within the FDA has already developed rapid screening methods utilizing a thermal desorber system to screen dietary supplements for undeclared drug ingredients and would like to continue using these methods moving forward on the new instrumentation.  Use of these existing methods would save the agency money by not requiring new method development and would also allow for immediate use of the instruments for sample screening.  <br /> <br />Acquisition of an HPIMS system that has the ability to utilize either a direct/electrospray (ESI) ionization source or a thermal desorber sampling introduction system will significantly improve FDA's ability to respond to these analytical challenges.  Routine screening of pharmaceutical products and dietary supplements using this methodology will increase the confidence in the quality of the drug supply chain by increasing the number of products tested in addition to providing the FDA with the required data to remove harmful products from the marketplace.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS) <br />To acquire an ion mobility spectrometer system capable of interfacing with both a direct spray ESI source and a thermal desorber sampling introduction accessory to improve our ability to monitor the quality of drug products. In order to differentiate between FDA-approved drug products and potentially-hazardous imported drug products, a sensitive analytical method for their characterization must be developed. Purchase of this system would allow for the development of rapid, reliable, sensitive and inexpensive screening methods to examine the quality of a wide array of imported drug products.  ESI sampling introduction would allow us to expand our current screening capabilities to include protein drug products and biopharmaceuticals. The objective of this project is to purchase a high performance ion mobility spectrometer capable of interfacing with both an electrospray ionization source (ESI) and a thermal desorber sampling introduction system. This statement of work covers the purchase of a high performance ion mobility spectrometer (HPIMS) as well as the direct electrospray ionization source, built in computer with touch screen interface, data acquisition and analysis software, installation, training and three years of warranty.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIH-NICHD-16-110 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $15.0M. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes &amp; Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure testing services of non-human primates (Male Cynomolgus Monkeys).
<p>Within the NIDDK intramural program, both the exploration of basic science and the application of knowledge are pursued. The inventions that have come from the program range from research tools such as antibodies and animal models, to diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine concepts. All but research tools require substantial investment of time and additional funds in order to be marketed. NIDDK has so far established a template of in vitro and limited in vivo tests. The laboratory of Ken Jacobson (LBC/MRS) has started with thorough in vitro testing and is progressing to in vivo testing. The first tests in animals start with bioavailability. The non-human primate tests are sought to approximate how the compounds might be expected to perform in humans.</p>
<p>The NIDDK Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, Molecular Recognition Section is advancing novel drug candidates through safety bioavailability and efficacy testing. This non-human primate study is needed for the continuation of these drug candidates evaluated in the following NIH publication: Chen Z, Janes K, Chen C, Doyle T, Bryant L, Tosh DK, Jacobson KA, Salvemini D. Controlling murine and rat chronic pain through A3 adenosine receptor activation. FASEB J. 2012 May; 26 (5):1855-65</p>
<p>"Clinical management of chronic neuropathic pain is limited by marginal effectiveness and unacceptable side effects of current drugs. We demonstrate A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonism as a new target-based therapeutic strategy. The development of mechanoallodynia in a well-characterized mouse model of neuropathic pain following chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve was rapidly and dose-dependently reversed by the A3AR agonists. Our findings provide the scientific rationale and pharmacological basis for therapeutic development of A3AR agonists for chronic pain."</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to award a purchase order for Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Drug candidates; "A", "B" and "C", in Male Cynomolgus Monkeys Following Intravenous and Oral Administration. The evaluation includes blood studies and observations indicative of nausea (emesis), decreased or increased appetite, digestive effects (loose stools, diarrhea) and any behavior changes occurring after dosing. The data will be transmitted via electronic format within 5 months of the end of the study. The study will involve 9 Male Cynomolgus Monkeys, testing is a week for each dosage route (IV/Oral), with a week of washout between each route. Testing and result transmittal will be complete within one year of the award.</p>
<p>Offerors who are capable of providing at a minimum, fifty-one percent (51%) of the required/actual services of this solicitation must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer.

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) applies to this acquisition with the following addenda:</p>
<p>(a) The following shall be used to evaluate quotes: (i) technical capability; (ii) past performance and (iii) price. Technical capability and past performance combined are significantly more important than price. Vendors with no record of past performance will be assigned a neutral rating for this factor. <br /><br />(i) Technical Capability: The Government will evaluate the vendor's technical capability submission in order to determine their understanding of the requirements of the SOW and the vendor's experience in performing the work specified, as well as their personnel qualifications, experience and capability to perform all the requirements of the SOW.</p>
<p>(ii) Past Performance. Quotes will be evaluated to assess the contractor's past performance history. Vendors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will be given a neutral rating for that factor.</p>
<p>(iii) Price. Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. While price is not the most important factor, its importance in this procurement will not be overlooked. The degree of its importance will increase commensurately with the degree of equality among non-price evaluation factors. For evaluation purposes, the entire 60 month ordering period for services will be evaluated. Also, see the following paragraph (b) "Options", regarding evaluation of the option period pursuant to FAR Clause 52.217-8. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers by adding the total estimated price for all five of the ordering periods comprising the 60 month ordering period. The Government will further evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the price for FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, to the total base and option periods price to derive an offeror's overall evaluated price. Accordingly, the unit pricing of each of the 12-month ordering periods shall be deemed fully evaluated for use by the Government should it elect to exercise FAR Clause 52.217-8, which is applicable to this solicitation and any subsequent award, and which may be exercised at different times, more than once, for a total period not to exceed six months. The price to be added for the purposes of this evaluation for FAR clause 52.217-8 shall be based on one half the quantity for the fifth ordering period multiplied by the evaluated price(s) for that period.</p>
<p>The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices for each of the ordering periods are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of option(s) shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1.0 Organization</p>
<p>1.1 Organization: The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC), is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship for living marine resources.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Objective: The ability to rapidly detect both microalgae that produce harmful toxins &amp; the toxins themselves is a growing national &amp; global need to ensure safe seafood and water. On the west coast of the US, increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) has resulted in increased closures of recreational &amp; commercial shellfish beds for harvest (Moore et al. 2009. Harmful Algae 8:463). Collecting &amp; analyzing water samples with higher resolution than feasible with manual methods permit a greater level of protection by serving as an early-warning system. NWFSC has obligated to position a robotic water sampler &amp; analyzer at an off-shore location for early detection of HABs at the Washington coast (NOAA award #NA14NOS0120149, entitled "Operational Ecological Forecasting of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Pacific Northwest Using an Environmental Sample Processor"). The robotic device, developed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, is the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP).</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested. A written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as RFQ # ABMC16PS0048. <br />The American Battle Monuments Commission, located in Arlington, VA has a requirement for the completion of Professional Interpretive Program (Personal Services) Evaluations for the American Battle Monuments Commission.<br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561110 and the size standard is $7.5MIL.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.
<p>Requirements-</p>
<p>Primary Work Tasks <br />This contract will focus attention on Professional Evaluation of Personal Service Interpretation Programs. It does not include Non-Personal Services or Exhibits at this time.<br />1.	Pre-visit evaluation of Interpretive Programs (Front End): In order to establish a   basic appreciation of the work taking place in each cemetery to be visited the contractor shall:<br />a.	Use email and telephone to evaluate the presence of Interpretive Themes;<br />b.	Use email and telephone to evaluate the use of Interpretive Themes, Goals, and Objectives;<br />c.	Using email and telephone, check for use of Interpretive Program Outlines;</p>
<p>2.	Evaluation of Interpretive Programs (Formative):  In order to glean desired information in each cemetery to be visited, the contractor shall evaluate each Interpreter at every cemetery visited to;</p>
<p>a.	Evaluate the quality of interpretive programs on the ground;<br />b.	Evaluate the use of Interpretive Goals, Themes, and Objectives;<br />c.	Using commonly accepted Interpretive Best Practices, evaluate interpretive presentation techniques by all Interpreters at all cemeteries visited and rate them as: <br />i.	Poor;<br />ii.	Acceptable;<br />iii.	Intermediate;<br />iv.	Good, or;<br />v.	Excellent.</p>
<p>3.	Post-visit evaluation of Interpretive Programs (Summative):<br />On return to the office, for each cemetery visited:<br />a.	Review  evaluation notes;<br />b.	Review Interpretive programs from film or video;<br />c.	Include mitigating circumstances<br />d.

<p>We believe that these are clear cut and measurable tasks.  Three standard ABMC evaluation forms are attached for use by the contractor.</p>
<p>By providing professional evaluations by an outside source, the contractor will assist in helping the ABMC ensure that future training, auditing, and coaching decisions at cemeteries and monuments are informed by sound data.</p>
<p>Interpretive Program Evaluations would be undertaken for Personal Service Interpretation Programs (Walks, hikes, guided tours, School Interpretation programs, Children's programs, etc.)</p>
<p>Work to be performed<br />Work would be performed at:<br />&bull;	Henri-Chappelle American Cemetery;<br />&bull;	Netherlands American Cemetery, and;<br />&bull;	Ardennes American Cemetery.</p>
<p>These three cemeteries are located relatively closely together so travel and lodging costs can be more easily controlled.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition DOJ-UST-16-0059 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-70). This acquisition will be processed as a fixed price requirement and is a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 511210, and the small-business size standard is $35.5 Million.
<p>The USTP routes the preponderance of their purchase requests and orders on paper. These purchase requests and orders are manually entered and processed using agency-specific financial systems, processes, and data definitions. Within this environment, the absence of common agency-wide Requisition Management Solution makes it difficult for USTP to process in a timely manner. The Department of Justice intends to move an enterprise wide Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) and Financial Management Service (FMS) Internet Payment Platform (IPP) - Treasury's electronic invoicing solution available to Federal agencies unfortunately USTP is at the tail end of the implementation.</p>
<p>A short term solution required to meet the immediate needs of the agency. To address this need an electronic purchase requisition and order creation (share point based) is proposed for agency to procure. The solution shall utilized Microsoft SharePoint which provides the masses of out-of-the-box functionality, enabling the organization to quickly create internal intranets and/or external facing partner portals to accomplish the task at reasonable price. In addition to this standard functionality, it also serves as a platform to develop and deploy custom content and functionality. Upon submission, the SharePoint workflow engine manages the review process for the rapid approval and real-time transaction creation. See attached DOJ-UST-16-0059.</p>
<p>There is no Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating assigned to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT: Arthur J. Altmeyer Building Renovation, Woodlawn, MD<br />BUILDING TYPE: Federal Office Building<br />HISTORIC STRUCTURE: No<br />CLIENT AGENCIES (PRIMARY): SSA<br />SIZE: 205,540  GSF<br />BUDGET: Estimated Construction Cost at Award is $100,000,000 - $120,000,000<br />FUNDING: Available
<p>GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: Per GSAM 536.602, the overall architect/engineering design team must demonstrate that at least thirty five percent (35%) of all required A/E contract services will be accomplished within the Baltimore, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE: No set-aside used. However, in accordance with Public Law 95-507 and FAR 52.219-9, should a large business receive award, the firm shall be required to provide subcontracting opportunities to small business concerns inclusive of those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the performance of this contract. As part of its commitment to the socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government for this procurement, the U.S. General Services Administration (Mid-Atlantic Region) has established the following subcontracting goals: <br />&bull; 36.5% for Small Business<br />&bull; 5.0% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), <br />&bull; 5.0% for Small Women-Owned Business, <br />&bull; 3.0% for Small HUBZone Business, <br />&bull; 3.0% for Small Veteran-Owned Business, and <br />&bull; 3.0% for Small Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented designers and architects to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 to 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED certified.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building is located on the north side of the SSA Woodlawn Campus at 6401 Security Boulevard, Woodlawn, MD 21235. The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building and attached Auditorium were constructed in 1959. The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building is comprised of ten occupied stories, a 30 foot deep mechanical space basement and a two-story penthouse on the roof. The basement mechanical space houses the boilers and chillers for the majority of the campus. The building is primarily used as office space for Senior SSA personnel and includes a series of private offices and open office configurations. Most of the building systems are original.</p>
<p>The project will consist of removal and replacement of the exterior cladding, interior finishes, MEP systems, stairs and elevators, stripping the building down to the existing reinforced concrete frame. The primary shafts (the stairs, elevators and other building systems risers) will be re-configured to suit modern requirements and a revised layout. It will incorporate sustainable design principles, efficient space planning, innovative technologies, and contemporary interior design to transform the building into a model workplace that is responsive to the existing building architecture. GSA intends for the building to fully vacant for the duration of the design and construction project. The mechanical plant in the basement will remain operational through-out the construction. The project will also consist of modernization of the 12,392 GSF auditorium connected to the Arthur J. Altmeyer Building. The delivery method for this project will be a Construction Manager as contractor (CMc).</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the construction of new interiors and related building systems. The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification, and customer agency requirements.</p>
<p>SELECTION PROCESS <br />This is a request for qualifications (RFQ) of A/E firms/lead designers interested in contracting for this work. A Lead Architectural Designer is required. The A/E firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The lead designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.</p>
<p>A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Area of the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. The A/E firm will address the contractual relationship with the lead designer and project team in Stage II.</p>
<p>The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested lead designers and associated A/E firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design and leadership capabilities of the lead designer and design firm. In Stage II, shortlisted lead designer-A/E teams will submit the qualifications of the proposed integrated design team and be interviewed.</p>

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product:<br />Listed Countries of Origin:<br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1) Technical Proposal Risk<br />2) Past Performance/Performance Risk<br />3) Price<br />An award will be made based on the best value proposal that is determined to be the most advantageous to the government, with appropriate consideration given to the price and non-price/cost factors.<br />1) Evaluation Factor 1: Technical</p>
<p>Subfactor 1:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience with Mental Modeling Technology<sup>TM</sup> to establish risk-based communication strategies.</p>

<p>Subfactor 4:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience with MedRespond's Synthetic Interview<sup>TM</sup> platform, which integrates artificial intelligence, search, and streaming media.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated based on the degree to which the proposal meets the minimum requirements specified in the solicitation for the evaluation factors. This will be accomplished by assigning a pass/fail rating supported by narrative rationale for the rating assigned.</p>
<p>2) Evaluation Factor 2: Past Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance on contracts of a similar nature, size, scope, and complexity, utilizing a comparable number of personnel with like skills for the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>3) Evaluation Factor 3: Price<br />Price Analysis will be accomplished in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 and will encompass the following:<br />a) Fully completed SF 1449 and bidding schedule;<br />b) Fully completed Representations and Certifications.</p>
<p><br />2<br />Price will also be evaluated to determine whether the offeror understands the requirements and risks inherent in the Performance Work Statement. In addition, Price will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness and the feasibility of performing all the terms and conditions of the solicitation within the total price proposed by the offeror and whether in consideration of the non-price factors it is the best value for the Government.<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>The written proposal will be the primary basis on which the Government will determine the capability of the Offeror to perform this work. It shall be specific, complete, thorough, clear and concise, and must address each requirement stated in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>The proposal shall not merely offer to comply with the Government's requirements by simply restating them, but shall specifically describe the means of accomplishment. The proposal in its entirety shall be specific, detailed, and complete to demonstrate that the Offeror has a thorough understanding of the solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>Statements such as "the Offeror understands, can or will comply with the requirement listed in the Performance Work Statement", statements that paraphrase the Performance Work Statement, or ambiguous phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed" or "well known techniques will be used" will be considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>Unnecessary elaboration or other presentations beyond that sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the Offeror's lack of cost consciousness. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper or bindings, and expensive visual or other presentation aids (with the exception of technical drawings and figures) are neither necessary nor desired. The proposal shall contain all the pertinent information in sufficient detail in the one area of the proposal where it contributes most critically to the discussion. When necessary, the Offeror shall refer to the initial discussion and identify its location within its proposal.</p>

<p><br />INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS AND PAYMENT:</p>
<p>USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (MAR 2010)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2007)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.</p>
<p>The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. For Vendor Registration Assistance and account activation, please contact the DISA Ogden E-Business Help Desk at 1-866-618-5988 option 2. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site. Training for this application is available at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>Notice to Vendors: Delivery of services to any address other than the delivery address specified in the contract is not authorized without a contract modification signed by the Contracting Officer. Failure to deliver to the address in the contract will result in rejection of invoices and will cause delay in payment.</p>
<p>Contract Administrator for this Contract is: TO BE ASSIGNED AFTER AWARD</p>
<p>The contractor is directed to use the "2-in-1" format when processing invoices and receiving reports. When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions:</p>
<p>Contract Number TO BE ASSIGNED <br />Delivery Order <br />Cage Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Pay DoDAAC M67443<br />Issue Date TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Issue By DoDAAC H92257<br />Admin By DoDAAC H92257<br />Ship To Code/Ext M20970<br />Ship From Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />LPO DoDAAC "Leave Blank" <br />Acceptor Email Address TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext "Leave Blank"</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the "Issue By DoDAAC", "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Pay DoDAAC". Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for "Combo," "2-in-1," and "Cost Voucher" are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under "Vendor Interface" section. On the Vendor Interface page click on "WAWF-RA" header at the top of the page. Under downloads on the WAWF-RA page that appears, click the appropriate document either "Combo," "2-in-1," or "Cost Voucher" to download the instructions. <br />Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA, but after submitting the document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications. Contractor shall click on "Send More Email Notification" on the page that appears. Add the acceptor's/receiver's email address (Note this address is their work email address not their WAWF-RA organizational email address) in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks, to include contract administrator SSgt Porfy Aragon at Porfirio.Aragon@socom.mil. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system. <br /><br />NOTE: The POCs identified above are for WAWF-RA issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Administrator identified in the contract to whom questions are to be addressed.<br /><br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In line with U.S. foreign policy objectives, the USAID/OTI Cameroon program will work to decrease the impacts of Boko Haram/Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP) in northern Cameroon.  Boko Haram/ISWAP threatens to further destabilize the Sahel, West and Central Africa regions, and its links with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) pose a great threat for ungoverned spaces in the region.  Recent security gains against Boko Haram/ISWAP are encouraging, but the social fabric in northern Cameroon has been severely strained due to the conflict.  USAID/OTI's Cameroon program would help to bolster local efforts to strengthen community cohesion and to further undermine Boko Haram/ISWAP's ability to recruit and operate in Cameroon.  The program will work closely with other USAID/OTI programs in the region to better connect U.S. Government efforts along the Diffa-Maiduguri-Maroua corridor.  <br /> <br />The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Africa Team Leader based in DC. The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the strategy development, design, oversight and management of OTI's Cameroon program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, local government officials, and local beneficiaries.<br /> <br />This post is an senior management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The Country Representative should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. The candidate should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and international organization officials. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including stabilization, counterinsurgency, community-driven development, elections, subnational governance, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, and human rights. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. A strong working knowledge of French is a requirement for this position. Willingness to work alongside military colleagues (both U.S. and non-U.S.) is essential. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments. Experience in remote project management is highly desirable, as this position is Yaound&eacute;-based yet will be overseeing a localized program in the Extreme North of Cameroon (Maroua).</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee, the Country Representative - Cameroon will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations, and regional OTI programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;<br /> <br />&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees), ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI programs and activities are monitored and evaluated, and that lessons learned feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to the in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative - Cameroon will be supervised by the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Cameroon, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout Cameroon, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Cameroon, the work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, the position also requires travel throughout Cameroon, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

POSITION TITLE: Rule of Law Advisor<br />6. MARKET VALUE: $83,173-$122,142 (FS-02 Equivalent)<br />7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award, with four optional years<br />8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Hanoi, Vietnam<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT <br />The Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is the bureau charged with foreign policy development relating to international crime, drug trafficking, corruption, criminal justice reform, post-conflict/civilian policing, and related issues. In Vietnam, and throughout Southeast Asia, INL supports criminal justice sector reforms and facilitates effective cross-border and regional law enforcement cooperation. In Vietnam, INL provides training and technical and material support to police, prosecutors, and judges. INL has a wide array of partners in this effort, including other U.S. agencies and international organizations.</p>
<p>Vietnam is a recipient of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding. INCLE funding assists countries in their fight against transnational crime and illicit threats, including efforts against terrorist networks, the illegal drug trade, and other illicit enterprises. Embassy Hanoi receives $450,000 annually in INCLE funding for the following programs: a law enforcement capacity building program for border police, implemented UNODC, and a justice program aimed at advancing the rule of law through UNDP and, previously, a short-term intermittent legal advisor implemented through the Department of Justice's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training. INL programs in Vietnam have supported the drafting of criminal laws, advised the Government of Vietnam (GVN) on international best practices related to pending criminal legislation, supported trial advocacy skills programs at four Vietnamese law schools, and facilitated better coordination between the Embassy and the GVN on legal and justice sector issues. Vietnam seeks to build the capacity of its law enforcement apparatus and bring its judicial sector and legal framework closer to international standards. INL's assistance programs are critical for achieving these goals.</p>
<p>Since the adoption of a new Constitution in 2013, Vietnam has undertaken a significant transformation of its criminal justice system from one that is inquisitorial to one that is more adversarial. Vietnam's National Assembly passed a new Penal Code and a new Criminal Procedure Code in November 2015 that will come into force on July 1, 2016. Together with a new Law on Custody and Temporary Detention and the Law on the Reorganization of the Courts, these legal reforms are changing how police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges interact and how justice is delivered. Although the reforms do not completely change the inquisitorial nature of the system, they introduce new concepts into the criminal justice system: presumption of innocence as a guiding principle in all trials, greater defense counsel rights, increased oversight of investigators, the right against self-incrimination, and codifying that the burden of proof in criminal cases is on the State. Nonetheless, a number of challenges remain unchanged in Vietnam's criminal law, primarily vague national security provisions that are vulnerable to misinterpretation and/or misapplication by government officials thereby threatening to have a negative impact on enjoyment of rights guaranteed by Vietnam's constitution and its international obligations.</p>
<p>Vietnam's considerable legal reform will continue. The recently passed criminal laws will need to be implemented and enforced by law enforcement at the local levels. Moreover, we anticipate the GVN passing implementing decrees that will provide additional guidance concerning how these laws will work in practice. Vietnam's 2016 legislative agenda includes additional laws that impact law enforcement interaction with the public - most notably the Law on Associations and Law on Demonstrations. Embassy Hanoi is already coordinating recommendations to the GVN on the drafts of these laws. We expect the Law on Communal Police, Law on Anti-Corruption, and Law on Compensation Responsibilities of the State to be reviewed and passed by Vietnam's National Assembly in 2017.</p>
<p>The purpose of this position is to provide a Rule of Law Advisor to U.S. Embassy Hanoi who will serve as the central role in implementing INL programming to support Vietnam's progress towards revising its laws, providing its citizens access to justice, and ensuring a fair, transparent judicial process. This program will be focused on providing constructive feedback on Vietnam's pending legislation pertaining to the criminal justice sector, as well as developing the legal research and legislative drafting capacity of Vietnam's legislators, staffers, and law drafting committees. The Advisor will also be expected to formulate innovative, targeted, and sustainable approaches for building the rule of law in Vietnam and complying with international standards of human rights.</p>
<p>The Advisor is responsible for in-country management of INL rule of law programs and ensuring that these programs are meeting expectations. The Advisor coordinates activities with the Deputy Political Counselor, the Rule of Law Political Officer in country, and the INL Office of Europe and Asia (INL/EA) Program Officer in Washington, DC. The Advisor also works closely with the management section at Post to ensure proper execution of INL programming. INL seeks applicants with the requisite technical expertise, and a strong management background who are able to operate independently and work with limited resources.</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />a. Serve as the Rule of Law Advisor within INL/EA's assistance mission in Vietnam.</p>
<p>b. Provide policy analysis and program guidance to INL, Embassy Hanoi, and other USG entities on effective mechanisms for, progress in, and impediments to, achieving reform objectives in Vietnam.</p>

<p>d. Implement INL rule of law program through training and mentoring. Serve as a trainer for INL-funded training programs. Provide mentoring and technical assistance to law drafters, prosecutors, law professors, judges, law enforcement officials, and private attorneys on a range of issues. Identify outside experts, when appropriate, to serve as trainers.</p>

<p>f. Establish and maintain relationships with Vietnam's justice sector and other government officials, including prosecutors, investigators, judges, defense attorneys, civil society, legislators, legal experts, and other rule of law actors, to include the law enforcement sector when appropriate. Ensure adequate follow up.</p>
<p>g. Design and monitor assistance programs for the criminal justice sector utilizing a range of methodologies, such as conducting interviews and focus groups, as well as reviewing analytical reports. Ensure program activities develop local capacity. Activities should include a broad range of justice sector actors and there should be a strong emphasis on joint/collective training between different criminal justice groups (i.e. police- prosecutor workshops).</p>
<p>h. Coordinate with other implementers in the international donor community.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">1.1 The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Office of General Counsel (OGC) Continuing Legal Education (CLE) seminar serves as the primary mechanism for the DLA attorneys to receive CLE credits required by their state bar associations and as a key coordinating forum for all attorneys and staff to receive updates on legal practice and procedure. The CLE Seminar also provides critical training for paralegals and support staff, many of whom have annual training requirements for their respective certifications. By providing training across DLA OGC, attorneys and staff receive important, consistent training and education with ultimate cost savings to DLA. The cost to hold the CLE Seminar is less than that of similar individual commercial training. </span></p>

GENERAL</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: ">. DLA OGC has been holding CLE seminars for over 20 years in an effort to provide attorneys with CLE credit and to deliver consistent training and guidance across DLA OGC. Due to the importance of training our OGC attorneys and staff, DLA believes the annual CLE seminar is needed and intends to hold the DLA 2016 CLE Seminar in October, 2016. The intent behind the seminar is two-fold: (1) to ensure attorneys, paralegals and support staff meet their state bar and accreditation requirements in a cost-effective manner and (2) provide consistent guidance, mission awareness, policy and training to a geographically dispersed DLA OGC. </span></p>

<p>A. EVALUATION FACTORS<br />General</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that an award under this solicitation shall be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined by the Government to represent the best value to meet the Government's needs.<br />The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include two parts which shall hold equal merit in determining best overall value to the Government.

<p>1) Technical Factors</p>
<p>Offerors shall be evaluated in accordance with the factors set forth below:</p>
<p>i) Understanding and Compliance with Requirements 20 POINTS<br />The proposal should address each aspect of the Statement of Work in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirement.

<p>For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.</p>
<p>Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost/price for the equipment in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost/Price realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost/price realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.</p>
<p>D. ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS (These factors will not be evaluated.)</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.<br /><br />Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.</p>
<p>The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the capability of the offeror. Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than if it has an acceptable record.</p>
<p>Past performance will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall quality of the offeror's past performance will be influential in determining the merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government. <br /><br />By past performance, the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the number or severity of an offeror's problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror's overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.</p>
<p>The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror.</p>

<p>SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE: No set-aside used. However, in accordance with Public Law 95-507 and FAR 52.219-9, should a large business receive award, the firm shall be required to provide subcontracting opportunities to small business concerns inclusive of those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the performance of this contract. As part of its commitment to the socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government for this procurement, the U.S. General Services Administration (Mid-Atlantic Region) has established the following subcontracting goals: <br />&bull; 36.5% for Small Business<br />&bull; 5.0% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), <br />&bull; 5.0% for Small Women-Owned Business, <br />&bull; 3.0% for Small HUBZone Business, <br />&bull; 3.0% for Small Veteran-Owned Business, and <br />&bull; 3.0% for Small Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented designers and architects to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 to 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED certified.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building is located on the north side of the SSA Woodlawn Campus at 6401 Security Boulevard, Woodlawn, MD 21235. The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building and attached Auditorium were constructed in 1959. The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building is comprised of ten occupied stories, a 30 foot deep mechanical space basement and a two-story penthouse on the roof. The basement mechanical space houses the boilers and chillers for the majority of the campus. The building is primarily used as office space for Senior SSA personnel and includes a series of private offices and open office configurations. Most of the building systems are original.</p>
<p>The project will consist of removal and replacement of the exterior cladding, interior finishes, MEP systems, stairs and elevators, stripping the building down to the existing reinforced concrete frame. The primary shafts (the stairs, elevators and other building systems risers) will be re-configured to suit modern requirements and a revised layout. It will incorporate sustainable design principles, efficient space planning, innovative technologies, and contemporary interior design to transform the building into a model workplace that is responsive to the existing building architecture. GSA intends for the building to be fully vacant for the duration of the construction project. The mechanical plant in the basement will remain operational through-out the construction. The project will also consist of modernization of the 12,392 GSF auditorium connected to the Arthur J. Altmeyer Building. The delivery method for this project will be a Construction Manager as contractor (CMc).</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the construction of new interiors and related building systems. The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification, and customer agency requirements.</p>
<p>SELECTION PROCESS <br />This is a request for qualifications (RFQ) of A/E firms/lead designers interested in contracting for this work. A Lead Architectural Designer is required. The A/E firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The lead designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.</p>
<p>A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the State of Maryland.  The search for qualified A/E firms is expanded to the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Virginia. The A/E firm will address the contractual relationship with the lead designer and project team in Stage II.</p>
<p>The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested lead designers and associated A/E firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design and leadership capabilities of the lead designer and design firm. In Stage II, shortlisted lead designer-A/E teams will submit the qualifications of the proposed integrated design team and be interviewed.</p>

<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building is located on the north side of the SSA Woodlawn Campus at 6401 Security Boulevard, Woodlawn, MD 21235. The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building and attached Auditorium were constructed in 1959. The Arthur J. Altmeyer Building is comprised of ten occupied stories, a 30 foot deep mechanical space basement and a two-story penthouse on the roof. The basement mechanical space houses the boilers and chillers for the majority of the campus. The building is primarily used as office space for Senior SSA personnel and includes a series of private offices and open office configurations. Most of the building systems are original.</p>
<p>The project will consist of removal and replacement of the exterior cladding, interior finishes, MEP systems, stairs and elevators, stripping the building down to the existing reinforced concrete frame. The primary shafts (the stairs, elevators and other building systems risers) will be re-configured to suit modern requirements and a revised layout. It will incorporate sustainable design principles, efficient space planning, innovative technologies, and contemporary interior design to transform the building into a model workplace that is responsive to the existing building architecture. GSA intends for the building to be fully vacant for the duration of the construction project. The mechanical plant in the basement will remain operational through-out the construction. The project will also consist of modernization of the 12,392 GSF auditorium connected to the Arthur J. Altmeyer Building. The delivery method for this project will be a Construction Manager as contractor (CMc).</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the construction of new interiors and related building systems. The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification, and customer agency requirements.</p>
<p>SELECTION PROCESS<br /><br />Stage II&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shortlisted lead designers and associated A/E firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. Sufficient time will be provided for the lead designer and associated A/E design firm to establish its team. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team. The government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I shortlist announcement. A Small Business Networking Session will be scheduled after a short list is announced, before the Stage II proposal is due.</p>
<p>The board will interview each team. Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and evaluation criteria as established for Stage II, and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer-A/E team's understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan. Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions will be used to rank the Lead Designer-A/E Teams.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Services under this procurement fall under NAICS Code 541310, Architectural Services. The small business size standard is $7.5 million in average annual revenues.

The Government will not consider offers for partial items or quantities.  Anticipated Contract Line Items are provided in Attachment 5, Pricing Structure Format.  The Government anticipates this effort to be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type single award contract for a 12-month base period with four 12-month options.  Offer Instructions: The Government may consider offers that fail to follow instructions to be unacceptable and ineligible for award.  In order to compete for the contract described in this synopsis/solicitation, a complete Technical Volume (technical elements described below) and Price Volume must be submitted.  Incomplete submissions may not be considered. Offers shall: 1. Include a separate Technical Volume (pages numbered) that excludes prices and pricing information; 2.

All text shall be formatted on an 8  by 11 inch page in 12 point Times New Roman font.  The Technical Volume shall address Factors I and II as follows: Factor I. Organizational Experience (a) Prepare and submit one (1) Organizational Experience Matrix (RFP Attachment 3) to explain the breadth, depth and relevance of your organizational experience since 1 May 2011 in the following Statement of Work (SOW - RFP Attachment 1) key areas: 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.2.4, 3.2.5 and 3.2.6.  Cite at least one (1) reference from the prime offeror, no more than one per subcontractor or consultant and no more than three (3) references total. Cite references in the following order: prime, subcontractor, and then consultant.  (b) For each reference cited, prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet (RFP Attachment 4) in accordance with the instructions contained therein.  Section 15 of the Reference Information Sheet requires offerors to provide a summary description of contract work, not to exceed three (3) additional single-sided pages in length, for each cited reference.  In completing these summary descriptions, offerors must explain the relevance of each cited reference with respect to one or more of the SOW key areas. The Government is not bound by an offeror's opinion of the relevance of its organizational experience.  Offerors need not address all above SOW key areas in the summary description of each reference; however, for evaluation purposes, ratings may be maximized by citing references that collectively demonstrate maximum breadth and depth of relevant experience in the SOW key areas. (c) In completing the summary descriptions of contract work for Section 15 of each Reference Information Sheet (not to exceed three (3) additional single sided pages per reference), clearly format the response to separate the discussion for each key area of the SOW.  Do not provide a consolidated response for multiple key areas of the SOW.  In evaluating the offeror's experience in each individual key area of the SOW, the Government will consider only the text designated in Section 15 of the Reference Information Sheet for that particular SOW key area. (d) In Section 5 of each Reference Information Sheet, the contractor must state the start date of only the work referenced, rather than the period of performance start date for the referenced contract.  The date in Section 5 can be no earlier than 1 May 2011. All of the work described in the summary description (i.e., the three (3) pages attached to the Reference Information Sheet) must have been performed on or after 1 May 2011.  Factor II. Technical Approach Each offeror will provide a detailed plan and approach in performing two (2) key areas as detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW).  Key Areas are as follows: Key Area 1 - General Requirements: Provide a detailed approach for meeting or exceeding each requirement provided under SOW Section 3.1 General Requirements (3.1.1.  3.1.6.) Key Area 2  Course of Instruction Requirements: Provide six (6) detailed course outlines meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements listed for each of the six (6) Courses of Instruction (COI), SOW Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2., 3.2.3, 3.2.4, 3.2.5. and 3.2.6.  The approach for each COI must also include the offeror's plan in tailoring concepts noted in those standards to SSC Pacific's defined project management architecture, assets and processes (ref. b and c. of the SOW).  Those COI's requiring a dynamic Computer Simulation (3.2.1. and 3.2.6) must incorporate a sample user scenario in each course outline.  *Note: All elements addressed in the SOW detailed in each paragraph must be addressed.  Key Area 1 and 2 under Factor II are limited to a total of 24 pages.   The Price Volume shall address Factors III as follows: Factor III.  Price Offerors shall complete the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) description, Quantity calculations, provide a Unit Price and an Extended Price for each CLIN and a total Firm- Fixed-Price for all line items provided in Attachment 5, Pricing Structure Format.  Offerors must ensure all blanks are completed and mathematical calculations are accurate for all CLIN(s) 0001-4012.   Evaluation Factors for Award: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order.  Factor I. Organizational Experience Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. An offeror's experience is relevant when it has been confronted with the kinds of challenges that it will likely face under the contract contemplated by this RFP. This evaluation will consider the breadth, depth and relevance of the offeror's Organizational Experience performed since 1 May 2011 in key areas of the SOW (specified below). Relevance may include, but is not limited to, similarity of work contemplated under the RFP with respect to complexity, length of performance, number of tasks, scope, type of work, and value. The RFP will instruct offerors to complete a prescribed matrix, which details experience in key areas from the SOW, by citing not more than three references. At least one reference will be from the prime offeror, and no more than one per subcontractor or consultant. Additionally, offerors will be instructed to complete a Reference Information Sheet for each reference cited. Section 15 of the Reference Information Sheet requires offerors to provide a summary description of contract work, not to exceed three (3) additional single sided pages per reference.  Offerors will be evaluated on the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated relevant experience in the following SOW key areas: 3.2.1.  Project Management Foundations Course of Instruction 3.2.2.  Project Controller Course of Instruction 3.2.3.  Project Management Professional Certification Course of Instruction 3.2.4.

Technical Approach The Government will evaluate the offeror's plan and approach in meeting the two (2) key areas as detailed above.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's Factor II Technical Approach to determine the degree to which the offeror demonstrates how it will meet or exceed the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) and the solicitation.  A combined technical/risk rating will be assessed on Factor II based on the offeror's plan and approach in performing two (2) key areas, General Requirements and Course of Instruction Requirements.  Note: Any offer rated an "Unacceptable" under Factors I or II may be determined to be ineligible for contract award.  Factor III. Price The offer will be evaluated based on the total firm-fixed-price. The Government will evaluate the total price to determine if it is fair and reasonable.  Basis For Award: This procurement will use the Best Value  Trade-off source selection methodology.  All technical (non-price) evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance: Factor I: Organizational Experience Factor II: Technical Approach  All technical (non-price) evaluation factors, when combined, are more important as price.  Questions Questions regarding this solicitation are to be submitted to SSC Pacific code 22710 via e mail to Doris Richardson (doris.richardson@navy.mil) and David Roden (david.roden@navy.mil) or the ECommerce Central Question Feature.

<DESC>The following Questions were received regarding this solicitation: <br />Question: 1.) One thing that is necessary is a water source for jet/vac trucks for cleaning. Can you advise if water will be provided on base? And, if so, if there are any charges for this? <br />Government Answer: Water from USDA hydrant, water is free<br />Question: 2.) Another necessary component is a location to dump solids pulled from the sanitary system. Is there a location on base that can accept sanitary sewer waste or must the contractor find a location off-base? <br />Government Answer:&nbsp;Contractor may can decant at one of our lagoons<br />Question: 3.) In "1.3.8.5" of the SOW, the inspection report mentions "Manhole rim and invert elevation" is required. I was hoping you could clarify what this means.<br />a. I suspect it means just the distances measured from the rim of the manhole to the invert of each pipe inside the manhole (including the outflow). If this is the case, this is relatively simple. <br />Government Answer: Measure from rim to flow line<br />b. If instead this means the actual "sea-level" elevation needs to be provided for both, this will require a base station and is essentially something closer to a full surveying workflow. We have the capability for both, but just wanted to confirm since there will be a material difference between A and B in terms of cost and equipment required. <br />Government Answer: Not required<br />Question: 4.) Is there a map of the system that can be provided prior to quotes? Will a map be provided prior to work starting? <br />Government Answer: None at this time. System is from 1940<br />(end)

<DESC>The following further questions were received:
<p>Question: "Decant" means dump liquids only. Does this imply no solids can be disposed of in lagoon? If so, we would need to find a landfill nearby and work on permitting, etc. to take off base. <br />Government Response: We will allow the vendor to dump solids on base.</p>
<p>Question: In regards to a map, it sounds like one won't be available even once job starts? If this is the case: Response: Yes, no plans.</p>
<p>Question: 1.) will there be an on-site representative who will be able to point out the manholes? <br />Response: Yes we have all the manholes located and identified<br />Question: 2.) would the USDA be interested in being provided a gis file (shape file) containing manholes and pipes derived from submeter locating of the manholes and televising while we were on site? <br />Response: No we just had an Alpha survey completed</p>
<p>Question: I can provide more detail about this if interested. <br />Response: None needed<br />(end)</p>

<DESC>This AMENDMENT 01 corrects the number of days to respond with a commercial item capability to reflect "45 Days" (emboldened). <br />**This amendment does NOT change the closing date for the synopsis**<br /><br /><br />SPECIAL NOTICE - INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS
<p>The Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Research Triangle Park (RTP), Contracting Division (CD) intends to enter into a contract with Triangle Experience Group (TEG), pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.</p>
<p>The Government has a requirement to support the formulation, design, development, fabrication, integration, verification, operation, and validation of a controlled interface that will enable the omni-directional exchange of information "Through-Within-Across" all domains and enclaves. The Government requires tailored collaboration spaces across multiple users, organizations, data domains, and security levels. The Government desires this controlled interface to be extended to integrated mission partner sites and support for the rapid growth of Virtual Data Transfers in the mission space in order to enable improved collaboration between the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war in order to improve the communication of strategy, planning, and execution in an increasingly dynamic battlespace. Key components to this requirement exist and the Government does have purpose rights to some software required. However, the government does not have proprietary rights to the Controlled Interface software, which is necessary to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must submit a capability statement for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals, nor does it represent a commitment by government to pay for any costs incurred by the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this notification. No solicitation document is available. The associated North American Industry Classification System code for this procurement is 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services). All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice by COB (4:30PM) June 17, 2016, to Lisa Gregory, Contracting Officer, at the email address listed below for consideration by the agency. Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.

<DESC>NOTE:&nbsp; ONLY CHANGE MADE BY THIS AMENDMENT IS THE DATE AND TIME FOR RECEIPT OF INFORMATION.&nbsp; DATE CHANGED FROM 8 JUL 2016 TO 15 JULY 2016.<br /><br />The US Army Natick Soldier, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is gathering information to replace/upgrade its Automated Robotic Vapor Adsorption Test (ARVAT). The ARVAT challenges carbon-loaded materials with a vapor stream of chemical warfare agent simulant to determine their ability to adsorb it. Currently, the ARVAT uses a simple, one-armed, rotary robot with a two-fingered grip to grab the ringed sample holder (metal disk), dry the sample, put it into the sample cell, close the cell, turn on/off vapor challenge stream, open the cell, return the disk, and repeat. The apparatus is arranged in a rotary formation, where the robot spins around its axis to each station and moves up/down and in/out as necessary. The system is more than 20 years old and runs on equipment that is no longer supported by the manufacturer. NSRDEC would like to receive options for replacing and/or upgrading the system, including the software for the automation.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.&nbsp; THE NUMBER FOR THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS HSCG79-16-I-1030.<br /><br />J&amp;A Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source contract to Aviat U.S. Incorporated, 5200 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, CA 95054-1108, for four years to provide manufacturer authorized 24/7 upper tier web-based and telephonic technical support to Coast Guard Field Engineers and manufacturer approved expedited depot-level component repair for three (3) products: Aviat Constellation Microwave Radios, Aviat Pro-Vision Network Monitoring System, and Fujitsu Flashwave 4100 SONET Multiplexers.</p>
<p>The current Microwave Radios, Network Monitors and Fujitsu Multiplexers require manufacturer approved support, hardware repair and digital software/firmware upgrades to assure reliable uninterrupted performance of mission critical USCG and Department of Defense (DOD) Emergency Communications Services.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely to determine whether there are any other sources that could meet the Coast Guard's technical and service requirements for Technical Support Service and Hardware Advance Replacement/Repair Services. This support service will enable the USCG microwave Field Engineers access to advance manufacturer engineers when local support efforts have failed to correct system outages and anomalies. Additionally, the Coast Guard is not aware of any other companies that have the capability to consolidate advanced technical support and component repair for the Microwave Radios, Microwave Network Monitoring System and the Fujitsu Flashwave SONET Multiplexers.</p>
<p>Companies that have the capability to deliver planned and emergency maintenance and site support services for Anchorage, Alaska by&nbsp;October 01, 2016, must submit a capability statement detailing how they would provide national distress systems maintenance and how it would maintain operational availability with minimal system down time. The USCG is responsible for the efficient and reliable operations of their Microwave Data transports in support of Homeland Security and Search and Rescue Missions.</p>
<p>The capability statement shall also include the company's Dun and Bradstreet number, a discussion of any previous experience similar to this requirement, and a point of contact in the event the Coast Guard requires additional information.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Proposals submitted based on this notice will not be accepted. Capability statements received prior to the closing date and time will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is possible.</p>
<p>Please submit information via email to the Primary Point of Contact listed below no later than 5:00PM (EST) on July 18, 2016.</p>

The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition are prescribed under FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), the order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given fair opportunity to be considered for the original order; and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(E), for orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a statue expressly authorizes that the purchase can be made from a specified source. Please see the attached Justification and Approval JA-2016-5-1624.
