<RESPDATE>090910
<CONTACT>Sondra Page, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882856, Email jpe7@cdc.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to support the requirements of the project entitled, "Assessment in Gaps in Booster Seat Policy". This acquisition is competed in accordance with FAR Part 13 and the proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.</p>
<p>Background and Need:</p>
<p>In the United Stated during 2008, 968 children ages 14 and younger died as occupants in motor vehicle crashes, and approximately 168,000 were injured. Although the majority of states have established booster seat legislation, the gaps in coverage are wide and children are not being adequately protected under the law. Restraint use among young children often depends upon the driver's seat belt use. Almost 40% of children riding with unbelted drivers were themselves unrestrained.</p>
<p>The overall, long-term goal of this activity is to reduce motor vehicle-related injuries and deaths among children ages 4-9 by increasing appropriate booster seat use through education and promotion of policy change.</p>
<p>Project Objective:</p>
<p>The objective of this purchase order will be to develop a planning guide to assist states with developing and implementing an action plan to improve booster seat policy. <br /><br />Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Under this agreement, the vendor shall, review current draft of guide which was compiled with information obtained from telephone interviews from stakeholders with knowledge of optimal booster seat use and policy, facilitate and convene an expert meeting of key CDC stakeholders and partners to refine the booster seat planning guide and assist in the development of an implementation plan to assist states in developing and implementing an action plan to improve state booster seat policy. The panel should include but not be limited to experts in the area of transportation, public health, education, and advocacy. Based on the discussions of the expert panel and feedback from CDC, the vendor will synthesize the information to complete a follow-up report that includes a revised booster seat planning guide and implementation plan that will provide the basis for a pilot study to determine its utility in strengthening state booster seat policy. The planning guide will help state's determine their capacity, and provide a guide to developing and implementing an action plan to strengthen their state's booster seat policy. The planning guide will increase the communication value by providing a crisp, readable, factual and helpful tool for states. To increase the likelihood that a state will use the planning guide for booster seat policy, expertise in communications products is needed to enhance the version developed by a panel of experts in injury and state policy.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 12 months. Request for Quote (RFQ) number 2010-Q-12710 will be issued on or about September 9th, 2010, through the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizops.gov. Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award. No bidder's list will be maintained. Notifications will not be sent to offerors regarding the issuance of the RFQ or any of its amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for release of this RFQ and any amendments.</p>

The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing specified Aircraft System Maintenance Training.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

1.. Capability Statement - This document should identify:	Type of training provided by your firm,	FAA  Course Number 	Size and type of training provided by previous contracts (provide detailed information and past performance)	Number of years in business
2.  Geographic area where training will be provided;
3.  Expected approach - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.
Attached is a list of the training required.  The FAA intends the procurement to result in a multiple awards for training.  The interested vendors should provide documentation for each course they can provide.  Each course will be technically evaluated and award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable vendor.  Vendors may receive some, none, or all awarded classes.

<DESC>The Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation on or about Oct. 28, 2010, for the Spit Point Stewardship project. This acquisition is under the authority of Section 347 of Public Law 105-277 to achieve land management objectives while meeting local community needs. In this acquisition, a combination of appropriated dollars and forest products will be used to obtain land management activities from a contractor. About 520 MBF of merchantable timber (a combination of spruce, hemlock, and alder) is available in three stands near Spit Point, in Carroll Inlet on Revillagigedo Island, near Ketchikan, Alaska. These stands are in the beach buffer, where previous clearcuts have resulted in dense conifer regeneration, elimination of the forage understory, and reduction in structural diversity. Two of the stands are 17 acres in size; one is 12 acres. In these three stands, the contractor will improve the wildlife habitat by removing biomass material and treating remaining slash. There are no roads connecting the project area to Ketchikan, and there are no roads connecting Ketchikan (or Revillagigedo Island) to the North American continent.
<p>The contemplated schedule includes solicitation release on or about Oct. 28, 2010, a pre-proposal conference in Ketchikan on or about Nov. 22, 2010, and proposals due on or about Dec. 6, 2010. These dates will be finalized in the solicitation. The solicitation will be available from this FedBizOpps website. A prospective offeror should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time to stay up-to-date on this acquisition. A request for proposals (RFP) is contemplated. A set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns is contemplated. NAICS Code 113110, Classification Code F, and Product/Service Code F006 are contemplated. A prospective offeror having comments on any of these matters should share them with the contracting officer by Oct. 25, 2010. The anticipated award date is before Dec. 31, 2010.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the intent of U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a solicitation to provide mission support services for the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO). These services will support GLNPO in developing and implementing programs under the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and other programs and initiatives. See: http://www.epa.gov/greatlakes/glri/. The services are Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) as defined in FAR 37.2. Policies and procedures for acquiring A&amp;AS by contract will be in accordance with FAR 37.2.</p>
<p>A determination was made that the following notice is not relevant to the Mission Support Service requirement. Therefore, this award restriction no longer applies for this procurement:</p>
<p>NOTIFICATION: Firms can pursue any or all of the six Great Lakes National Program office (GLNPO) contracts but a firm will only be able to be awarded one of the six contracts, as either, a prime, team subcontractor or a first tier subcontractor. Currently we are planning to award one mission contract (forecast number FY10-250), two great lake architect engineer services (GLAES) (brooks act) contracts (forecast number FY10-241) and three construction contracts (forecast number FY10-216).<br /><br />The Government is contemplating a single award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract from this solicitation using full and open competition. The resulting contract will contain fixed rates for labor. The government may issue either time-and-materials (T&amp;M) or firm-fixed-price (FFP) task orders. The anticipated ordering period includes a thirty-six (36) month Base Period and two-twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7M. The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about January 2011 and proposals will be due thirty days from the posting date. This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.<br /><br />The anticipated award date for this requirement is on or about June 2011. Contract award will be made using a best value approach with technical capability being of greater importance than cost or price.</p>
<p>The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website at: http://www.epa.gov/region5/business/contracting.htm All interested parties should check these sites frequently for updates.</p>

The purpose of this document is to set forth the minimum standards for a contractor's COI plan. The CO may require the contractor to provide additional information if necessary.<br /><br />2. COI PLAN<br /><br />The contractor's COI Plan is a document which describes the procedures a company uses to identify and report COI. Generally, a contractor's corporate COI plan will describe how a company, in its entirety, addresses conflicts, and will not be contract or program specific. The plan may also describe the options a company will consider proposing to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate a COI whenever a conflict is identified. The plan will be evaluated by the applicable EPA Contracting Officer (CO), and approved by the CO if the Plan meets the EPA's minimum requirements for detecting and reporting conflicts of interest. The CO may accept the same version of a COI plan previously approved by another CO when appropriate. Contractors' COI Plans should be identified by a version number and date, as appropriate. EPA should be advised of the version number, date, and applicable CO for any previously approved COI plan.<br /><br />3. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CONTRACTORS' COI PLANS<br /><br />A. Corporate Structure<br /><br />The COI Plan shall describe any parent relationship and list all affiliates, subsidiaries, and sister companies, etc. Generally, this need not exceed three corporate tiers, unless a relationship exists beyond three tiers that would potentially create a conflict. In such a case, relationships beyond three tiers should also be included in the COI Plan. Contractors shall report changes in its corporate structure to the Agency throughout contract performance.<br />Contractors are invited to include under this section a company profile. The profile should discuss all pertinent information relevant to COI including a summary of a contractor's primary and/or environmental business functions, relationships, and activities. This background information will be very useful to COs when evaluating whether or not a contractor has a COI.<br /><br />B. Searching and Identifying COI<br /><br />The COI Plan shall include a requirement describing when a COI search must be performed by company personnel and clearly identify the procedures to be followed. The searching requirement shall encompass all work related to all clients for whom work was performed over the past three years, all current work, all sites (if applicable), and any future work reflected in marketing proposals. Contractors must search their records over the past 36 months, or through all available records for a new company until 36 months of records are accumulated, from the time of receipt of the work from EPA. However, contractors are encouraged to search back as far as a company's records cover.<br /><br />C. Data Base<br /><br />The COI Plan shall require a data base that includes all necessary information for a contractor to review its past work (at a minimum over the past 36 months or through all available records for a new company until 36 months of records are accumulated), work in progress, and work the company may be pursuing under any marketing proposals. This requirement does not establish any particular type or kind of retrieval system, however, the data base shall contain, at a minimum, the following information and capabilities.<br />(1) a list of the company's past and current (public and private) clients; contractor has worked on;<br />(2) a description of the type(s) of work that was performed and any other pertinent information;<br />(3) a list of the past sites (when applicable) a contractor has worked;<br />(4) a list of site name(s) (when applicable) related to any work performed;<br />(5) the ability to search and retrieve the information performed; and<br />(6) dollar value of work performed;<br />(7) a list of work the company may be pursuing in the future.<br />If applicable, the COI Plan shall include provisions for supplemental searches of parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or sister company records. The COI Plan shall also describe any cross-checks used by the company when searching COI issues.<br /><br />D. Personal Certification<br /><br />At a minimum, the COI Plan shall require ALL employees of the company performing work under an EPA Superfund and/or Non-Superfund contract, including work on a site, work relating to a site, work pertaining to a CERCLA/RCRA action, or work that may endanger a CERCLA enforcement action, to sign a personal certification. EPA recommends a policy whereby all company employees are required to sign such a certification rather than only those employees working under an EPA contract. The certification shall require at a minimum that the individual agrees to report to the proper company authority any personal COI and that the individual has read and understands the company's COI Plan and procedures. Employee certifications shall be retained by the company.<br /><br />E. Work Assignment (WA), Technical Direction Document (TDD), or Delivery <br />Order (DO) Notification and Certification<br /><br />If the contract contains the requirement for WAs, TDDs, or DOs, the COI Plan shall describe the company's process for meeting the Agency's notification requirement prior to beginning work and for submission of the company's WA/TDD/DO certification within 20 days of receipt of the EPA work. <br />NOTE: WA/TDD/DO certifications are NOT required if the contract contains an annual certification requirement. Nevertheless, the contractor's COI Plan shall address the procedures to be followed for WA/TDD/DO certifications.<br /><br />F. Annual Certification <br /><br />The COI Plan shall describe the process the company uses for submission of its annual certification.<br /><br />NOTE: Annual certification is NOT required if the contract contains a WA/TDD/DO certification requirement. Nevertheless, the contractor's COI Plan shall address the procedures to be followed for annual certifications.<br /><br />G. Notification and Documentation<br /><br />The COI Plan shall clearly identify the official within the company responsible for making COI determinations. Generally, this would be someone at a middle to upper level of management. The responsible official shall be free of any personal conflicts for the purpose of making COI determinations, e.g., a program manager who receives bonuses based on the total amount of sales may not be free of conflicts.<br />The COI Plan shall clearly identify the process that is followed when notifying the EPA of any actual or potential COI and the actions that the company has taken or will take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the conflict. In addition, the contractor shall document all COI searches related to EPA work, whether or not an actual or potential COI has been identified.<br /><br />H. Training<br /><br />The COI Plan shall require all employees of the company to receive basic COI training and that each employee receive COI awareness training at least annually. The company's COI Plan shall be available for all employees to review. Annual awareness training shall include, at a minimum, a review of the certification language and any changes that may have occurred in the company's COI Plan or Government COI regulations. In addition, companies are encouraged to routinely disseminate to their employees current COI information.<br /><br />I. Subcontractor's COI Plans<br /><br />The COI Plan shall describe the process and mechanism by which the company will monitor its subcontractors to ensure all subcontractors are complying with the COI provisions in their contracts. It is important that subcontractors identify and report COI as well as submit Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) requests for approval.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN<br /><br />The plan described in the "CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN" will be evaluated as acceptable or not acceptable as part of the contracting officer's responsibility determination of the contractor. Notwithstanding any other evaluation of the offeror's proposal, an offeror that submits a plan that is unacceptable at the time of award will not be eligible for a contract award.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The United States General Services Administration (GSA) currently occupies Flex Space under a lease in Landover, Maryland. GSA is seeking a replacement lease of approximately 105,000 rentable square feet of space to house this requirement. The space must meet NFPA requirements for fire and life safety plus handicapped access in accordance with ABAAS guidelines. Approximately 30% of the space is used for warehouse and related functions and 70% for office and administrative functions. The space must be located within 2,640 walkable linear feet of a metrorail station.</p>
<p>The facility must be able to accommodate an emergency generator that in the event of a power outage can sustain a work force of approximately 100 employees for five days. The space offered must be capable of accommodating ISC Level III Security requirements.</p>
<p>The Government will consider relocation if it is determined to be economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as other costs likely to be incurred through locating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: The proposed lease is for ten (10) years firm with a five (5) year renewal option.</p>
<p>LOCATION: All properties submitted to the Government must be located within 2,640 walkable linear feet of a metrorail station and within the delineated area bound by the following:</p>
<p>North: Annapolis Road <br />East: Interstate 95/495<br />South: Central Avenue <br />West: Southern Avenue, SE to Southern Avenue, NE to Eastern Avenue, NE to Route 295/Baltimore Washington Parkway</p>
<p>Spaces fronting both sides of perimeter streets of the delineated area will be considered.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY DATE: Space must be ready for occupancy and delivered to the Government no later than May 1, 2011.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at a minimum (this is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):<br />&bull; Building name/address and age.<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date of availability.<br />&bull; One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered.<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA defined general office usable square feet ("USF").<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet ("RSF") offered and rental rate per usable square foot, specifying included services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance of $42.08/ANSI BOMA office area SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements.<br />&bull; Common Area Factor used to determine the RSF.<br />&bull; Location and number of parking spaces available to the Government and cost, if any.<br />&bull; Date building will be ready for commencement of tenant improvements.<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.</p>
<p>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS: GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit an expression of interest no later than 3:00 pm EST October 27, 2010, to the Government's Broker Representative at the following address. Please reference Project Number 8MD2198.</p>
<p>E-mail, fax, or mail complete expressions of interest to:</p>

11. Description:

In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards. The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.

The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequent Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions identified in table 1. This includes mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant, regardless of their occupational series, are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  
VA is one of the largest consumers of commercially-acquired goods and services in the Federal Government.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include: See Table 1.  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  See Attachment 1. 

Table 1- Acquisition Workforce Job Functions
Job Functions
Contract Specialists  					Construction and Facilities Management
Contracting Officer Technical Representative	Information Technology Specialists
Program Managers					Systems Engineers		
Logistics Management Specialists
 
For the past two years, the VA has been instructing classes for the acquisition workforce. Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide support of the evaluation of the training program using the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model and ROI. (These services will not be used to identify individuals or individual's data measure or job performance.) See Table 2. 

Table 2- Evaluation Training Program Support

Deliverables: The vendor will deliver monthly reports that include an analysis of the data.  The vendor will provide raw data in a non-proprietary format upon request.
1c. Level 3- Measure: Transfer/Behavior Change- The vendor will perform Level 3 evaluations of student behavior that demonstrates learning transferred to their job performance.  The vendor will perform follow-up evaluations at 3, 6, and 9 month intervals.  The vendor will make contact with 100% of the students and supervisors.  The 3 month interval requires a minimum 50% response from the students and supervisors.  The 6 month interval requires a minimum 40% response from the students and supervisors.  The 9 month interval requires 25% response from the students and supervisors.  Deliverables: The vendor will deliver monthly reports that include an analysis of the data.  The vendor will provide raw data in a non-proprietary format upon request.
1d. Level 4- Measure: Results- The Vendor will perform Level 4 evaluations to determine the impact training had on the organization.  The scope will be defined per separate task orders that are firm fixed price and based on labor categories. Deliverables and delivery schedule will be stipulated in individual task orders.
1e. ROI- Measure: Return on Investment- The vender will identify the proper procedures and measures and calculate the ROI for the VAAA and each of the 4 schools. Deliverables and delivery schedule will be stipulated in individual task orders.
1f. Program Definitions- Measure: Level 4 & ROI definition- The vender will collaborate with the VAAA and training stakeholders to identify the appropriate programs and measures for Level 4 and ROI for the VAAA as a whole and each of the individual schools. Deliverables and delivery schedule will be stipulated in individual task orders

Furthermore, there is not sufficient research in the area of the supporting preprocessing and matching algorithms. <BR><BR>This RFI requests industry to provide information on approaches and best practices for accomplishing the previously stated capabilities. Specifically, more research in the area of non  cooperative biometric data algorithms needs to be conducted. The government requires a thorough examination of the effectiveness of Cooperative Biometric Matching Algorithms on preprocessed biometrics and recommended modifications to both preprocessing and matching algorithms. Effectiveness in this RFI is defined as the ability to increase the confidence of correlation/match on non-cooperative biometric templates as well as decreasing the False Accept/Reject Rate. <BR><BR>The effort involves initiating testing of Cooperative Biometric Matching Algorithms on Non-Cooperative Biometric Templates. The government will also provide access to a collection of image data assembled to reflect biometric images of the low fidelity to facilitate algorithm development. As stated previously, documenting test results and recommending modifications to the current Cooperative Biometric Matching Algorithms is a key activity. Research in optimal fusion algorithms capable of fusing Single Modal, Multi-Angle biometrics is expected. <BR><BR>The government team is specifically seeking industry input on one or both of the following topics: Preprocessing Algorithms and Enhanced Matching Algorithms to be used on low fidelity and low quality biometric data. Responses to either one or both topics will be considered.<BR>

<DESC>Re-Construction /Development of PEMS<BR>SUMMARY<BR>The United States Military Academy at West Point employs several boilers to generate steam that is used for electrical production and for space heating and domestic hot water heating.  Boilers 1 and 2 at the facility are two new units that are subject to the nitrogen oxide standards and monitoring requirements outlined in New Source Performance Standards listed in 40 CFR 60, Subpart Db. In lieu of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS), the facility had chosen to monitor boiler operating conditions and predict NOX emissions during natural gas firing using a Predictive Emission Monitoring System (PEMS).  A NOX emission default factor may be used to generate NOX emissions data during infrequent fuel oil firing.<BR>The NOx predictive algorithms that are used are derived from the fuel usage and flue gas oxygen values. The PEMS calculates NOx from flue gas oxygen concentration and natural gas flow.  The system hardware consists of an oxygen (O2) analyzer (Land Genesis model g1200), a Rosemount gas meter, the oil flow meter, and a central control unit (formerly Moore Procidia, more recently Siemens Moore Procidia type on  353 controllers).  The oxygen analyzer currently operates on the 0-21 percent span.<BR>Boilers 1 and 2 are equipped with identical boiler control systems.  Boiler control is performed by a series of network multi-loop controllers or control stations.  The control stations are located in the centralized operator control booth. The PEMS DAS is responsible for monitoring boiler operating parameters and reporting of NOX emission data. The DAS also monitors and reports oxygen analyzer calibrations, system alarms, and generates required NOX emissions reports.<BR>EXISTING  SYSTEM<BR>The Siemens Moore Procidia Control system serves as an interface between the oxygen analyzer, fuel flow meters, and the data acquisition system (DAS).  The oxygen analyzer sends emissions data in units of oxygen through the Procidia Control system to a data acquisition computer located in the plant.  The Procidia DAS software was intended to produce averages and store emissions data, compile data for semi-annual Part 60 Subpart Db reports, and evaluate daily Oxygen sensor calibrations. The DAS and Procidia units should all be connected via 10BaseT Ethernet, which is a commonly used networking protocol.  <BR>Data from sensors, available in real-time to the DAS, is logged every hour to the raw log file(MS-Excel format)  The PEMS calculations for NOx are performed when the reports are produced and the daily Fuel and Oxygen data are added to an MS-Access database.  This database includes a query with the NOx algorithm to produce the PEMS output data.<BR>The installation of the new PEMS DAS which was started 20th January, 2009 was never completed and is now being solicited for bids to re-construct the system and return it to its intended functionality. Currently data is collected via the Siemens Moore Procidia Boiler Control System and the PEMS calculations completed via an MS-access database in conjunction with an MS-excel spreadsheet.<BR>Opacity data is collected from an OPAC 2020 meter and is currently being logged but no reports are available.<BR>NEW RE-CONSTRUCTED PEMS <BR>The existing Predictive Emissions Monitoring System and Opacity Monitoring System (collectively referred to as PEMS) does not adequately meet the needs of the users.  The objective of this project is to enhance the existing system to provide the needed functionality.<BR><BR>The PEMS hardware consists of two existing workstations and various field devices.  The data is collected from the field devices via an Ethernet network.  The workstations are configured identically but are independent.  The concept is that if one station is out of service that the other will continue collecting data.  <BR>In summary the work required consists of:<BR>"	Simplify or replace w/ equivalent the existing Lookout application.<BR>"	Supply any and all additional software licenses required to implement the applications described in this document.<BR>"	Create a new database and database tables to support the required reporting functionality.<BR>"	Develop custom database application to produce averages and totals as required.<BR>"	Develop custom database application to retrieve required data from the historian (Citadel Historian or equivalent).<BR>"	Develop custom database application to retrieve missing data from the other node.<BR>"	Develop custom database application to allow the user to view and correct invalid measurements.<BR>"	Develop custom application to allow the user to generate a report from a list of pre-defined reports. <BR>"	 Develop custom database application to retrieve opacity data to produce one-minute, 6 min aver, daily and monthly reports as well as incident and calibration reports.<BR>"	 Develop a set of PEMS and Opacity pre-defined reports<BR><BR>*****THIS IS NOT A BID, IT FOR MARKET RESEARCH FOR A UP COMING PROJECT AT WEST POINT.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 5.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice.

The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a small business set-aside, full and open competition, or sole-source procurement.<br /><br />NOAA is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce that is focused on the condition of the oceans and the atmosphere. The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's economic, social and environmental needs. As a supplier of environmental information products, NOAA provides the nation with information that pertains to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clearly manifest in the production of weather warnings and forecasts through the National Weather Service, but NOAA's information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well. NOAA serves as the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.<br /><br />NOAA is a trusted source of accurate and objective scientific information in four particular areas of national and global importance which constitute its long-term mission critical and strategic goals:<br />&bull; Ecosystems: Ensure the sustainable use of resources and balance competing uses of coastal and marine ecosystems, recognizing both their human and natural components. <br />&bull; Climate: Understand changes in climate, including the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, to ensure that we can plan and respond properly. <br />&bull; Weather &amp; Water: Provide data and forecasts for weather and water cycle events, including storms, droughts and floods. <br />&bull; Commerce &amp; Transportation: Provide weather, climate, and ecosystem information to make sure individual and commercial transportation is safe, efficient and environmentally sound.
<p><br />To assist it in framing its long-term strategic course, NOAA requires input in many complex and interrelated scientific and technical topics. This requires an understanding of the current state of science as well as an intimate knowledge of newly emerging scientific and technical methodologies to support recommendations for future directions NOAA should take into consideration while laying out its strategic plan to meet its mission goals.<br /><br />The government needs to acquire independent scientific, technical, and policy guidance from scientists and others in a variety of environmental and public policy issues through the conduct of scientific studies which result in compilation of written reports by an institution that has been formally chartered by the U.S. Congress to provide independent scientific advice to the Congress and federal agencies.<br /><br />Areas to be investigated through studies, but are not limited to, the following areas of interest:<br />&bull; Integrated Observing and Data Management System<br />&bull; Assessments and Forecasts of Coastal and Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Scenario Development to Support Specific Management Actions and Decisions<br />&bull; Exploring Unknown and Little Known Areas of Earth's Oceans<br />&bull; Capacity Building and Effective Knowledge Transfer<br />&bull; Integrated Global Observation and Data System<br />&bull; Documenting and Understanding Changes in Climate Forcings and Feedbacks<br />&bull; Improving Climate Predictions and Projections<br />&bull; Understanding Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Enhancing NOAA's Operational Decision Support Tools<br />&bull; Improving Weather Forecasts and Warnings<br />&bull; Water Resources Forecasting<br />&bull; Providing Information to Air Quality Decision Makers and Establishing and Improving a National Air Quality Forecast Capability<br />&bull; Improving Understanding and Forecast Capability in Coasts, Estuaries, and Oceans<br />&bull; Reduced Risks to Life, Health, and Property<br />&bull; Issues that Slow or Stop Movement of Goods<br />&bull; Reduced Risks and Adverse Environmental Impacts<br />&bull; Security</p>
<p>Firms that believe that they have the necessary expertise and capacity to provide these studies may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The capability statement shall be no more than twenty (20) single-sided pages in length and shall address the following topics:<br />&bull; Organization's Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />&bull; Brief summary describing your organization and purpose. If you are an educational institution, list any specific areas of study (e.g. - degree programs, emphasis programs).<br />&bull; Provide a list of experience and studies in topics that are similar to the above. Discuss how scientific experts and qualified scientists are selected to conduct these studies. Discuss how you would incorporate a wide range of views to give a spectrum of scientific thought in a subject area. If studies were conducted on behalf of the government, list department and agency along with a point of contact name, number, and email address.<br />&bull; List experience/education/certifications of any key personnel relevant to the studies above completed in the past five (5) years. Copies of resumes and a list of relevant papers published should be included. The list should provide at a minimum, the author, name of the study, publication, and date with a synopsis of the study.<br />&bull; Credibility, impartiality, and objectivity of the study by your institution.

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
The purpose of this combined Sources Sought is to 1) identify potential vendors to meet a need of the United States Special Operations Command for a Thermal Laser Pointer (TLP) and 2) notify industry that NSWC Crane may procure up to 36000 units.
This acquisition is for a laser product that provides aiming and pointing capability in the 8-12 micron wavelength range, or long wave infrared band (LWIR), for users with LWIR sensors.  The TLP should be mountable to the rail system of the M-4 Carbine without obscuring the optics.  The TLP is meant to augment or replace the current NIR AN/PEQ-2A systems.
The white paper in response to this notification, should address in detail how the manufacturer intends to meet the LWIR requirement and future requirements in the Mid-Wave IR and Short-Wave IR bands.  Summary of the firm's capabilities needs to address as a minimum the following:
1.  An executive summary of the firm's capability and experience in pointer technology.  Additional information in the executive summary should include a discussion of the proposed solution to NSWC Crane's requirements to include; proposed product maturity*, current status of proposed product (concept, brass board, engineering model, in production)*, any test results if applicable, pictures if applicable, and product literature. 
2.  Matrix that includes performance characteristics including expected range, power requirements, beam divergence, output power, wavelength, weight, and +dimensions.  
3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for units to include applicable quantity breaks up to 2000.
*Note: It is NSWC Crane's intention to rapidly review the information received under this sources sought notification and proceed to issue a Request for Proposal.  It is extremely important for companies to identify the level of maturity of their proposed solution.
Responses are due by Noon (12:00PM) Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT) on April 1, 2010.  All responses shall include company's administrative information in addition to the technical detail requested above.
All responses must be sent electronically (Microsoft 2003 compatible) to the Technical Point of Contact:  Mr. Matt Thurner, matthew.thurner@navy.mil, telephone number (812)854-2383. 

NSWC Crane anticipates conducting an industry day on April 15, 2010 to provide company(s) the opportunity to provide a technical presentation (no more than 30 minutes in length).

<DESC>Sole source award for Maintenance of Autoclaves
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Plant Protection and Quarantine Facility in Beltsville, MD intends to award a sole source purchase order to Steris Corp. for Quarterly Maintenance of Autoclaves. Total dollar amount on award will be $25,005.25 The rationale for this intention to Sole Source can be found in FAR 6.302-1 ( Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements )</p>
<p><br />The Beltsville, MD facility has 4 autoclaves with steam generators and a dishwasher that were purchased from 3-10 years ago from STERIS. Every year since these purchases, they have had a preventative maintenance contract with STERIS to inspect and service this equipment. These autoclaves apply steam under high pressure to sterilize laboratory implements and media as well as kill plant material before disposal. They need to be regularly serviced so the materials placed inside them are truly sterilized and so the workers nearby are protected. This preventative maintenance contract is standard practice for owners of autoclaves.</p>
<p><br />This maintenance contract has never been open for bids. The manufacturers of autoclaves usually don't authorize other companies to perform repairs or maintenance on their autoclaves.</p>
<p><br />Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent services of authorized Maintenance on STERIS Autoclaves are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office. Small Business concerns are encouraged to participate. This is not a request for competitive proposals Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to possibly conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), intends to negotiate a&nbsp;sole-source procurement with Hirsch Electronics Corporation for server, software and database service and support for BPD's Hirsch Electronics Physical Access Control System (PACS). The Government intends to award a firm fixed contract for a base year, with 9 one year option periods. <br /><br />Hirsch Electronics is the only provider of server, software and database support for their proprietary Physical Access Control System (PACS) software. This service is not the same as programming performed by their authorized dealers which is limited to the application (velocity) and the controller and door hardware. No other manufacturers offer compatible equipment that could link up with what is currently installed. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Hirsch Electornics. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.<br /><br />Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

This extension is necessary to allowsufficient time to finalize contract award activities associated with the SoftwareEngineering Support (SES) procurement.	This extension will allow for a continuation ofcurrent service orders issued, for modifications to existing service orders, and for newwork until the SES competitive follow-on contract is in place. The contract extension andincrease to the IDIQ maximum ordering value are necessary in order to ensure programcontinuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts to theAETD and supporting directorates.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875. Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, Room 2-1SE3401, 1412 Jackson Loop, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.

	(c)	The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

	(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)	   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

		(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

(NOTE:  A Susceptible rating cannot be a final rating.  The final rating will either increase to a rating of Acceptable or decrease to Unacceptable.) (b) Options.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>52.209-8 Updates of Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. (APR 2010)(a) The Contractor shall update the information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) on a semi-annual basis, throughout the life of the contract, by entering the required information in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). (b)(1) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor's record. (2) The Contractor will have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government. The comments will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor comments will remain a part of the record unless the Contractor revises them. (3) With the exception of the Contractor, only Government personnel and authorized users performing business on behalf of the Government will be able to view the Contractor's record in the system. Public requests for system information will be handled under Freedom of Information Act procedures, including, where appropriate, procedures promulgated under E.O. 12600.(End of clause)<br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>

(iv) In a <br />criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last <br />five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. (d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http:// www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). "Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:<br />Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)<br />2100 Second Street, SW<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202)267-2285<br />FAX: (202)267-4011</p>

<DESC>1) Based on market research, we found that the Medical Lab Technician and Phlebotomist incumbent personnel are receiving base pay rates that significantly exceed the rates provided in the applicable wage determination. Utilization of incumbent personnel limits transition risk, and ensures uninterrupted support for these requirements. In the event that we decide to offer wage rates that entice incumbent employees to continue working at Keesler AFB in their current capacity, proposed costs will likely exceed those of offerors who limit compensation to that identified in the wage determination. How will the Government evaluate the offeror's approach to reducing performance risk by offering base wage rates that exceed those provided in the wage determination, yet ensure retention of qualified, incumbent personnel?
<p>A. It is not necessary to keep the incumbent rates in place.</p>

<DESC>Question to solicitation PWS
<p>1. Section 1.9.5.1 of the PWS requires that these positions possess both BLS and ACLS. In the commercial marketplace, ACLS certification for these types of positions is rare and unusual. Will the Government consider removing the ACLS requirement for these positions so as to increase the available candidate pool? If not, would the Government allow candidates to being working without ACLS certification with the requirement that they obtain it within 6 months of starting as sometimes ACLS classes are not regularly available in the marketplace.</p>
<p>A. The "AND" should be an "OR".</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to support the requirements of the project entitled, "Assessment in Gaps in Booster Seat Policy". This acquisition is competed in accordance with FAR Part 13 and the proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.<br />Background and Need:<br />In the United Stated during 2008, 968 children ages 14 and younger died as occupants in motor vehicle crashes, and approximately 168,000 were injured. Although the majority of states have established booster seat legislation, the gaps in coverage are wide and children are not being adequately protected under the law. Restraint use among young children often depends upon the driver's seat belt use. Almost 40% of children riding with unbelted drivers were themselves unrestrained. <br />The overall, long-term goal of this activity is to reduce motor vehicle-related injuries and deaths among children ages 4-9 by increasing appropriate booster seat use through education and promotion of policy change.<br />Project Objective: <br />The objective of this purchase order will be to develop a planning guide to assist states with developing and implementing an action plan to improve booster seat policy. <br />Scope of Work:<br />Under this agreement, the vendor shall, review current draft of guide which was compiled with information obtained from telephone interviews from stakeholders with knowledge of optimal booster seat use and policy, facilitate and convene an expert meeting of key CDC stakeholders and partners to refine the booster seat planning guide and assist in the development of an implementation plan to assist states in developing and implementing an action plan to improve state booster seat policy. The panel should include but not be limited to experts in the area of transportation, public health, education, and advocacy. Based on the discussions of the expert panel and feedback from CDC, the vendor will synthesize the information to complete a follow-up report that includes a revised booster seat planning guide and implementation plan that will provide the basis for a pilot study to determine its utility in strengthening state booster seat policy. The planning guide will help state's determine their capacity, and provide a guide to developing and implementing an action plan to strengthen their state's booster seat policy. The planning guide will increase the communication value by providing a crisp, readable, factual and helpful tool for states. To increase the likelihood that a state will use the planning guide for booster seat policy, expertise in communications products is needed to enhance the version developed by a panel of experts in injury and state policy.
<p>The period of performance shall be 12 months. Request for Quote (RFQ) number 2010-Q-12710 will be issued on or about September 9th, 2010, through the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizops.gov. Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award. No bidder's list will be maintained. Notifications will not be sent to offerors regarding the issuance of the RFQ or any of its amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for release of this RFQ and any amendments.</p>

<DESC>****RFI SUBMISSION DATE CHANGE****<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only:
<p>The TH-57C Flight Instrument Trainer (FIT), Device 2B42A, is a motion based (Stewart configuration) simulator which replicates the cockpit of the TH-57C type model series aircraft. The simulator is utilized by the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) to train Student Naval Aviators (SNA) in intermediate and advanced helicopter training. Six devices are located in NAS Whiting Field, FL. Five of the six devices have completed a service life extension program (SLEP) and are currently supporting helicopter training for over 600 students per year. The sixth and final device will complete the SLEP effort and be returned in the Spring of 2011. The TH-57B and C type model series aircraft have begun a cockpit modernization effort which includes the incorporation of digital flight instrumentation and a new flight control stability augmentation system. Simultaneously, the cockpit avionics will be undergoing an obsolescence upgrade. These efforts will involve the total replacement of nearly all of the aircraft instrumentation and structural panels. The aircraft modifications will be accomplished during the scheduled maintenance cycles (ACI) by the aircraft Contractor Logistics Services (CLS) contractor utilizing a single kit. The resulting aircraft will be designated the TH-57D. In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft, the six FITs must also be converted to the TH-57D configuration.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine the potential cost, technical challenges, and schedule requirements to modify the current FITs. The responses will also assist in identifying small businesses with sufficient capability and experience to accomplish this procurement which will be used to determine whether this procurement will be a small business set-aside. As part of this potential procurement, NAVAIR intends to provide one aircraft kit for each simulator as GFE to support this cockpit conversion effort. The contents of the aircraft kit is attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of ongoing training requirements, CNATRA must have a minimum of five simulators continuously available in order to not impact student throughput. Each training device undergoing modifications must be accepted and returned to training prior to another device being taken out of service.</p>
<p>In addition to the digital flight instrumentation and avionics, the aircraft modification kit includes a new flight control stability augmentation system (SAS) that will be incorporated in the aircraft. The functional characteristics (normal operating and malfunction) of this system as installed in the aircraft, to include an accurate aerodynamic math model, must also be modeled in the simulator. Current aerodynamic math model characteristics may also be modified to support tail rotor malfunctions/autorotation characteristics. Flight test data as available from the cockpit integrator and FAA flight test will be provided as criteria data for the SAS performance in the simulator.</p>
<p>The recently service life extended trainers also included the incorporation of Night Vision Device (NVD) compatibility. This NVD compatibility must be maintained with the incorporation of the cockpit modifications. In addition, the entire FIT working area exposed to the cockpit, to include the Instructor Operating Station (IOS), must be NVD compatible.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, upgrades/obsolescence technical refresh to the simulator computer operating systems and other subsystems impacted by the cockpit modifications must be considered and included in this effort in order to sustain the post-modified trainers. The capability to refresh navigational databases in the simulator, similar to the method that the aircraft receives updates, should also be included in the modification of the simulator and accommodated by the redesign of the computer operating system.</p>
<p>Currently the FITs provide out the window visual presentations for only the pilot seated in the right seat. The cockpit field of view must be expanded to support dual pilot out the window visual presentations. In order to address this concern, NAVAIRSYSCOM is proposing expansion or replacement of the current display system as an option to this cockpit modernization effort.</p>
<p>Contract award of this effort is anticipated in late Summer of 2011.</p>
<p>Information Requested. (Request that responses be limited to twenty pages.)</p>
<p>Please provide the top five risks or issues your company has identified that could have potential negative impact to the successful completion of this modification effort, and any risk mitigation strategies for these items.</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>Provide summary of experience within the past five years with ARINC 429 bus architecture avionics and integrating aircraft cockpit avionics into a simulator. Note potential challenges with respect to integrating aircraft hardware into simulators.</p>
<p>Provide a summary of experience within the past five years with modeling rotary wing aircraft flight characteristics.</p>
<p>Provide experience within the past five years in visual system integration, specific to modifying visual systems or replacing the system in its entirety.</p>
<p>Please provide a list of challenges within the efforts you have identified, and how they were satisfied.<br /><br />Delivery Cost and Schedule</p>
<p>Provide a financial Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate to accomplish this effort. Request that the ROM be broken into areas of: simulator cockpit avionics modification (don't include the actual cost of the avionics, this will be provided GFE); aerodynamic math modeling of the new SAS functionality and increased tail rotor malfunction and autorotation flight characteristics; modification of the simulator operating system and or other subsystems impacted by the cockpit modification; modification of trainer to ensure NVD compatibility of entire FIT area exposed to the cockpit, including the IOS; visual display system field of view increase to include the copilot seated in the left seat of the cockpit.</p>
<p>Identify a top level schedule to accomplish the above listed requirements for the six simulators. Identify where the effort will be conducted and the expected timeframe that each trainer will be taken out of service and or removed from NAS Whiting Field.</p>
<p>Company Capabilities, Processes, and Capacity</p>
<p>Considering your company's current and projected workload, please describe how your company would provide the necessary staff to accomplish the work identified. Specifically address providing the necessary staff at NAS Whiting Field, FL.</p>
<p>Please list any assumptions, conditions, or limitations that would impact your company's ability to accomplish this effort.</p>
<p>Please describe your business capacity for taking on this additional effort, taking into account current and planned workload. Describe any additional resources that are available to you to increase capacity.</p>
<p>Please provide a description of your current software engineering capacities/capabilities including staffing, organizational structure and CMMI level.</p>
<p>What predictive software tools do you use, relative to identifying the following:<br />a. To predict how much SLOC to be developed/modified/re-used<br />b. What is complexity/risk<br />c. To predict competence/qty of staff required<br />d. Length of time required to complete software changes<br />e. Expected number of DRs</p>
<p>Please provide a description of your current hardware engineering and manufacturing capacities/capabilities, including staffing and organizational structure.</p>
<p>Please provide a description of Earned Value Management (EVM) processes your company uses to maintain cost, schedule, and performance of your contracts.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a request for information only, not a solicitation, nor is it an offer to do business of any kind. Any response to this request should be undertaken at your own risk and expense.</p>
<p>Depending upon your firm's responses, the government may request a visit to your facility(s) to gain a further understanding of your capabilities.</p>
<p>To assist interested contractors in their responses, the GFE cockpit avionics list&nbsp; and&nbsp;the TH-57 Field-of-View plot are attached to this RFI.&nbsp; The&nbsp;simulator photos&nbsp;are posted on the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Business Opportunities website located at http://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers to the questions posed at the Market Survey conducted at NAS Whiting Field, FL are posted there as well.</p>

This is a synopsis for a Research and Development effort to develop a laser product that provides aiming and pointing capability in the 8 to 12 micron wavelength range, with a focus in the long wave infrared (LWIR) band.  This Thermal Laser Pointer (TLP) should be mountable to the rail system of the M-4 Carbine and SCAR (Special Combat Assault Rifle) rifle without obscuring the optics.   
This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open competition basis and may result in the award of no more than three contracts so as to discover the most effective technology moving forward.  Current plans are to award the first Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) upon contract award and continue to award CLIN's after successful program/design reviews. 
The government reserves the right to award at any Technical Readiness Levels (TRL) within Phase I and or Phase II.  Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration database. 
The Contract Line Item Numbers are anticipated to be as follows: CLIN 0001-Phase I Preliminary Design; CLIN 0002-Phase I Detailed Design; CLIN 0003-Phase I Prototype; CLIN 0004-Phase II Preliminary Design; CLIN 0005-Phase II Detailed Design; CLIN 0006-Phase II Prototype; CLIN 0007-Travel; CLIN 0008-Data

11. Description:

In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards. The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.

The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequent Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions identified in table 1. This includes mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant, regardless of their occupational series, are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  
VA is one of the largest consumers of commercially-acquired goods and services in the Federal Government.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include: See Table 1.  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  See Attachment 1. 

Table 1- Acquisition Workforce Job Functions
Job Functions
Contract Specialists  					Construction and Facilities Management
Contracting Officer Technical Representative	Information Technology Specialists
Program Managers					Systems Engineers

For the past two years, the VA has been instructing classes for the acquisition workforce. Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide support of the evaluation of the training program using the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model and ROI. (These services will not be used to identify individuals or individual's data measure or job performance.) See Table 2.

The 9 month interval requires 25% response from the students and supervisors.  Deliverables: The vendor will deliver monthly reports that include an analysis of the data.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This effort supports the JRO approved ORD for JBPDS, which require continuous detection and simultaneous identification of biological warfare agents from air samples.  Such a portable system, which can be used either on a ship or in a shelter and/or trailer, consists of a Cyclone Collector/Concentrator, a Bioagent Warning Sensor, a Fluidic Transfer System, an Identifier, and a Local Control System with data management and communication capabilities.

<DESC>This post-award notification for the Chimney Repairs Project in Manchester, NH is made pursuant to FAR 15.503. 

All SDVOSB vendors were solicited by our contracting office on this RFP through www.FBO.gov. Six vendors submitted a proposal to our office for consideration. One Proposal was Eliminated from the Competitive range. Five proposals were reviewed carefully by the Source Selection Board and by the Contracting Department.

This is a Best Value determination, integrating the evaluation of Past Performance, Technical Proposal and Price. Past Performance and Technical are of equal weight, but when combined are significantly more important than is Price. On 09/27/2010, It was determined that KMK Construction presented the best overall value and was awarded this contract in the amount of $208,884.00

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION DUE TO SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT

1.	REQUIRING ACTIVITY:
The VA West LA Campus at 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90073, VA Sepulveda Campus at 16111 Plummer Street, Sepulveda, CA 91343, and the Los Angeles Ambulatory Care Clinic at 351 Temple Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012, located in Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN) 22.

2.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:
The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Energy Business Center, 4141 Rockside Rd., Seven Hills, Ohio, 44131.

3.	DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:
The VA is soliciting via a Request for Proposal for the design and installation of electrical and water meters. These meters will connect into an existing ION EEM server established and managed by the pilot contractor.  The Metering System installation must include the meter units, design, documentation, construction (all equipment, tools, materials, travel, and supplies to install the meters and make fully operational), and testing of the Metering System. 

For existing meters that only need protection fuses and/ or CTs a complete design is not required.  Contractor to provide submittals for the CTs and the fuses.  Contractor can re use existing meters from the original Pilot contract ensuring that they match electrical requirements. 
A.  Comply with EISA 2007, EO 13423 and EPA Act of 2005.
B.  Be capable of full integration and function with the VA Pilot Metering Project.  
C.  Read, accumulate and communicate at most 15-minute interval non-electric data.
D.  Be expandable and open protocol - capable of accepting any manufacturer's meters that meets standard industry protocol, and compatible with VA web based remote monitoring system. 
E.  Encompass a full service solution that permits data accumulation, archive and reporting for analysis at the local, network administration and corporate levels.
F.  Be user-friendly and easy-to-expand and update by local medical center staff.
G.  The system shall be capable of monitoring, tracking and trending each non-electric utility meter to verify total usage, bill accuracy, and savings resulting from energy management system usage for both VA owned and out-leased sites.   

4.	PROPOSED ACTION:
The Sole Source procurement of the additional meters for VISN 22.

5.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:
FAR 6.302-5, "Authorized by Statute"

6.	NATURE OF ACQUISITION TO MEET THE AUTHORITY CITED IN PARAGRAPH 5:
Authority is authorized pursuant to 38 U.S.C 8127 under PL 109-461.

7.	MARKET RESEARCH:
The contractor BVB Construction, Inc. was recommended by VISN 22 as a responsible SDVOSB, registered in the VIP Database and in CCR, and has an applicable NAICS code 236220. BVB Construction, Inc. has previously demonstrated their ability to complete projects at VA facilities in VISN 22 of similar size and scope.  Due to the expiring funds for this project, it is in the best interest of the government to sole source this procurement to BVB Construction, Inc.

8.	PRICE ANALYSIS:
The determination of a fair and reasonable cost will be accomplished through the comparison of proposed price with the government estimate, and comparison with previous projects of similar scope and magnitude, as well as current Davis Bacon rates.  

9.	FUTURE ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:
Sole source awards are made to SDVOSB's through P.L. 109, under statutory authority.

10.	This Justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
