<DESC>Title: Support for Minority Internship in Health Sciences Librarianship

NAICS:  611310

Small Business Size Standard:  $6 million

 
It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to award a purchase order on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 to Arizona Health Sciences Library (AHSL), University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ) to provide internships in health sciences librarianship to Hispanic-American and Native American students accepted in the Knowledge River Institute program and enrolled in the School of Information Resources and Library Science (SIRLS) at the University of Arizona (UA).  The period of performance shall be for one (1) year with a one-year option period.
 
The Knowledge River Institute pays tuition for Hispanic-American and Native American students enrolled in the School of Information Resources and Library Science (SIRLS).  SIRLS, through this program, is committed to preparing Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans for careers in library or information fields.  SIRLS has created partnerships with various Arizona libraries in order to provide internships that allow Knowledge River students to gain experience in working libraries and to be exposed to different types of library service.  

Specifically, AHSL shall 1) expose KRI students to career opportunities in health sciences librarianship by providing a working internship at AHSL and 2) enrich the ongoing services and outreach projects of AHSL by leveraging cultural and language-skill expertise of the KRI interns to inform and enable AHSL staff to better meet the health information needs of Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans.

NLM has determined AHSL to be uniquely qualified to offer the above services.  AHSL is active in outreach projects around the state that involve interaction with Native American and/or Hispanic populations.  These outreach projects provide insight as to cultural norms and effective strategies for working with and developing relationships with Native American and Hispanic populations.  The AHSL also serves as a consumer health resource for the community and as the library for the University Medical Center.  

This service will be awarded under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 

1)  Offeror must show availability of an ALA accredited masters degree level program in library science that includes a cultural program appropriate for Hispanic and Native American students.  If the offeror is not a school or program in library science, it must be clear that there is a very close relationship between the offeror and the academic institution offering the masters degree, such as two parts of the same institution. (50%)  

2)  Offeror must show a clear and organized internship program such that the students will have an opportunity to obtain practical knowledge and experience with health sciences librarianship within a health sciences library setting.  This program shall also show mentorship for the interns as well as opportunities to meet others within the health sciences library community. (35%)  

3)  Offeror must include a plan to promote awareness of this internship program in health sciences librarianship within the target communities and the health sciences library community. (15%).

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-183/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

BACKGROUND:

Aloe Barbadensis (Miller) Whole Leaf Extract.  The Aloe Vera whole leaf extract used in these studies will be the product obtained solely from mature, fresh Aloe Barbadensis leaves.  The extract will be produced by grinding whole Aloe Vera leaves.  The extract will then be treated with 23 mg/L Cellulase to reduce viscosity and maximize yields.  This product will contain not only the inner gel but also the latex of the leaf, which is found in the bundle sheaf cells beneath the epidermis.  The pulp will be removed from the extract by filtration and the product will be lyophilized to 6.0% maximum moisture content.  The lyophilate will have a total bacterial plate count of less than 10,000 CFU/gram and be negative for the presence of Coliforms.  The pH, alcohol precipitable hexose, malic acid and aloin content of the product will be reported for each prepared batch.  Each batch will be assigned a unique lot number.  

The Aloe Vera test material handling, processing and preparation specifications are as followed: 

1.)	The Aloe Vera test materials will be the products obtained solely from mature, fresh Aloe Barbadensis (Miller) leaves. 

2.)	Lyophilization of the products obtained from mature, fresh Aloe Barbadensis leaves will begin within a maximum of 6 hours of harvesting the leaves.

3.)	 The Aloe Vera substance will be unadulterated.   No stabilizers or other substances will be added to the products.

4.)	 The selected supplier will furnish analytical data to support the authentication of the supplied lyophilized Aloe Vera gel, whole leaf extract, and latex as unadulterated products of fresh leaves from the Aloe Barbadensis (Miller);.

5.)	The prepared Aloe Vera test materials will be stored at-20degree C and shipped to NCTR on dry ice.

<SOLNBR>3741
<RESPDATE>072904
<ARCHDATE>08282004
<CONTACT>RHONDA ROBINSON, 202-493-4356
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System Sec.3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform GSA Schedule 70 vendors of FAAâ€™s intent to contract with a selected source via single source procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration intends to enter into a Single Source Contract with Titan Corporation to provide specialized Engineering and Technical Services to the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program (VDRP) for a period one year, with options for two additional years. The ASAP is a voluntary safety reporting program for employees of Part 121 & 145 certificate holders that is established through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the FAA and which may entail the identification of possible regulatory violations by the employer, as well as by the reporting employee.  The VDRP is a voluntary reporting program for certificate holders and production approval holders operating under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  Those organizations may report their own possible violations, including violations identified through the ASAP, under the VDRP, subject to acceptance and tracking by the FAA of a comprehensive fix to prevent reoccurrence of the violation by the reporting organization. Titan has designed, developed, and is in the midst of  implementing an ISO9001 compliant prototype electronic information management system for ASAP to enable the tracking and archiving of ASAP MOUs, revisions thereto, FAA acceptance letters, renewal due dates, and quality assurance program reviews, as well as a data base of safety enhancements, including comprehensive fixes to voluntary disclosures,  achieved through ASAP and reported on a quarterly basis by FAA certificate holding district offices. Titan has designed and is in the midst of developing software to enable a new web-based venue for operator VDRP submissions, and for FAA processing of those submissions in accordance with the steps identified in FAA Advisory Circular 00-58.  The system will also provide a secure national database of all VDRP submissions at every stage of their processing.  Further, it will automatically update the limited data fields for voluntary disclosures presently in the FAA's Enforcement Information System (EIS) in order to maintain the utility of that legacy system, while enabling much more detailed voluntary disclosure information tracking in the new system.  Titan has coordinated with the FAA Information Technology staff at the FAA Aeronautical Center to assure the software under development will interface appropriately with the EIS for voluntary disclosure input. Similarly, Titan has accomplished the necessary coordination to enable software design and interface for automatically populating the new VDRP system with information already available in other FAA databases (e.g. automated operations specifications). Software development for the preceding efforts is 65% complete, and beta testing, including testing of interface with EIS and related FAA databases, is planned to begin before the end of Fiscal Year 2004, upon completion of version 1 of the software system.  In order to maintain continuity at this critical stage of program development, and to avoid the program delay that would otherwise ensue were the current development team to be replaced at the expiration of the current period of performance, the FAA intends to award a sole source contract to Titan. These programs require continued development to ensure proper implementation and rollout to the national user community.  The ASAP and VDRP programs are required to ensure that valid information is collected, aggregated, and analyzed to identify safety issues across the airline industry before they become major problems. This project requires a contractor with specific knowledge and experience with the ASAP and VDRP, and that offers strong technical qualifications to provide systems design and modeling, systems integration, network analysis, technical consulting, prototyping, document management and data access, internet development, business process re-engineering, office automation systems, configuration management and hardware and software recommendations.  More detailed descriptions of the types of professional services required are provided in the attached Statement of Work. During the period of performance for the present acquisition, the FAA will conduct a market analysis to determine if other vendors can support future stages of this effort, or portions thereof.  It is the FAA's intention to conduct a competition for future requirements to support the ASAP and VDRP systems, once initial operating capability has been successfully demonstrated.      Interest vendors may respond by July 29, 2004 @ 3:00 p.m.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Rhonda F. Robinson, Contract Specialist, by  Facsimile responses are not permitted.  Electronic responses can be sent to the following e-mail address: rhonda.f.robinson@faa.gov.

<SUBJECT>C -- Multi-Discipline Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services
<SOLNBR>FA4809-04-R0003
<RESPDATE>121803

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base.  This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each.  The NAICS Code is 541330.  A-E services are required for the preparation of estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects at Dare County Bomb Range, Fort Fisher and Seymour Johnson AFB in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract.  Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will exceed $10,000,000.  The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project.  The fees under the IDIQ contract will not exceed $750,000 for any base or option period with the maximum task order amount of $299,000.  The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000.  The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, electrical, fire protection and mechanical requirements.  Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required.  Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm.  The firm(s) must provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services.  The firms(s) must provide full and/or part-time on-site design and plan review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis.  All drawings must be formatted in AUTOCAD Release 2000 or higher.  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system.  The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet.  Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system.  Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness.  The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites.  All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their  sub-contractors.  The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions.  For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work.  Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.    
B.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Selection criteria to be utilized are listed in the relative order of importance as follows:  1.  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials; 2.

Professional capacity to complete projects within the established time limits, meeting project dollar thresholds, and current work load; 4.  Ability to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering.  Ability to provide full and/or part-time on-site design and plan review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis.  5.

Are there any preliminary conclusions about which  technologies may or may not be feasible?    ANSWER: Indian Head EPC technology survey study was briefed at 10 March 2004 Industry Day.  The EPC study was initiated to gain insight into what technologies are available, not necessarily feasible.  It was meant to be a review of potential EPC concepts.  Feasibility of any offered system will be determined by the programs performance parameters that are a part of the forthcoming RFP.  The thruster study is a separate effort.  No conclusions about feasibility, with reference to use on the T-38C, will be made based on  either study.	 10. QUESTION: Would the Government, under any circumstances, find a canopy cutting/fracturing system acceptable for the T-38 ESUP?     ANSWER: The Government will not provide/define design solutions to the offerors; only requirements are defined.  However, all risks associated with any technical solutions, as proposed, will be analyzed and evaluated during the source selection along with any and all corresponding costs (e.g. acquisition costs, maintenance and support costs, etc.). 11. QUESTION: Will all anthropometric/reach measurements be taken with the seat full-up/down?  Is there any danger this could disguise an improvement achieved in positions that *match* the full-up/down extremes of the current Northrop seat?     ANSWER: The measurements will be done at the design eye, full up, full down positions thus we can then predict accommodation at all seat positions.   Additionally, measurements will be taken at full aft to full forward in 1 inch  increments. 12. QUESTION: What are the plans for the upgrade (time + location)? Will the upgrade be accomplished (1) base by base, (2) mixed base support, (3) all updated within x months?     ANSWER: The upgrade will be accomplished base by base. 13. QUESTION: Please expand on the Government s intent for new MA25 thruster?   A statement was made that this is not a developmental program but it appears that the Government is developing a new thruster system - please clarify?  Is it the Government's intent to provide this new thruster system as GFAE after development is completed or based upon the study results, is it the USAF's intent that each contractor bid the production implementation of their escape path configuration?     ANSWER: The Indian Head MA25A1 efforts are meant to determine if the basic component can be safely upgraded with increased energetic loading and what performance can be expected with such upgrades.  The Government will supply this data to industry for informational purposes only, the contractor s may use the Indian Head information as they see fit.  It is not the intent of the Government to provide the thruster as GFAE. 14. QUESTION: Discuss current 50 KT speed requirement for canopy removal/chute.  Is the 50KT needed to remove the canopy or is it needed to achieve parachute deployment?  Which is the critical factor, one or both?     ANSWER: With the current seat and current system timing, both factors are critical. 15. QUESTION: What metrics will be used to evaluate seat performance?     ANSWER: This information will be contained in the RFP. 16. QUESTION: Has the modified M25A1 resulted in an increased physical envelope?  If yes, has the availability of the increased envelope been confirmed or evaluated (in the aircraft)?     ANSWER: The modification of the M25A1 is internal.  There is no change to the size/shape of the unit.  No evaluation of the M25A1 on the aircraft has taken place or is planned by the Government. 17. QUESTION: What testing is being done on the thruster in the area of complete mechanism/linkage to determine what, if any, distortion or failures occur?     ANSWER: No such testing has been undertaken or is planned by the Government. 18. QUESTION: The Government has projected approximately $40M in FY05 - how will it be spent?  Can you share any current budgetary projections?     ANSWER: Our intent in FY05 is to initiate compatibility testing and purchase initial seats/ISS depending on the FY05 appropriation.  The projected profile is to buy seats/ISS for 60 aircraft per year and install in the following year. //END OF UPDATE// For more information on ESUP--T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/ESUP/ESUP.asp

<DESC>The USDA ¡V National Finance Center (NFC) has a requirement for support services to implement XML publishing extensions to the NFC Electronic Publishing System (EPS), as described in the section below.  It is the intent of the government to negotiate on a sole source basis as a Simplified Acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 13 with The Systems Group, 5114 Balconies Wood Drive, Suite. 307-392, Austin, TX  78759.
INTRODUCTION: A key service that the National Finance Center (NFC) provides to its internal and external customers is the development and maintenance of the numerous documentation web sites and the handling of the repositories for this documentation.  Several areas at NFC play a major role in providing this service.  These areas include the (1) Government Employees Services Division¡¦s (GESD) Payroll/Personnel Services Branch, (2) GESD¡¦s Government Employees Services Branch (GESB), (3) Facilities and Logisitics Staff¡¦s Publishing and Visual Communications Team, and (4) Controller Operations¡¦ Division, Quality Assurance and Accounting Directives Branch.  These areas working together handle the following responsibilities: (1) analysis, design, publication, distribution, and retention of all NFC procedures, bulletins, and directives relating to NFC systems and services; (2) development, design, and maintenance of the NFC¡¦s PUBS & FORMS internet site which hosts all procedural documents developed by DAB along with other reference documents needed by NFC customers and other Special Interest Group web sites; (3) development, design, and maintenance of the NFC¡¦s ¡§NFCnet¡¨ intranet web site for use by all NFC employees; (4) electronic forms design and management; (5) development and publication of online help text for NFC client-server and Web based applications; and (6) distribution of both hardcopy and electronic directives, memos, and other documentation throughout NFC and to our customer agencies.
This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for contractor services in support of the NFC XML Documentation and On-Line Help Pilot, as described in this document.
BACKGROUND: 
NFC¡¦s EPS is an integral component in providing documentation services to NFC customers. The EPS is a highly complex system that encompasses hardware, software, and connectivity components from a wide range of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and as such, has required an extremely complex and detailed systems integration effort for its implementation. Specifically, the EPS environment includes the following:

Hardware, System Software, and Connectivity 
EPS hardware includes IBM RS/6000 servers with IBM RAID subsystems; SUN UltraSPARC power user workstations; Windows 2000 Wintel Clients; and a wide range of general and task specific printing, plotting, and dedicated production equipment. EPS operating system environments include IBM AIX v5.L, Sun Solaris 8 (SPARC and x86), and Microsoft Windows 2000. All Wintel Clients support native Windows applications, client/server LAN applications, and host based UNIX and mainframe applications via X-Windows emulation and TN-3270, respectively. Networking equipment includes Cisco Level 3 switches, routers, and dedicated WAN connections. The departmental LAN is TCP/IP 100base-T based, with routed links to; the site wide Gigabit fiber backbone, the public Internet, and intranet WAN connections. The EPS networking environment supports connectivity with an IBM ¡§Z¡¨ series mainframe system, Windows Active Directory based SMB servers, UNIX NFS based servers, and the NFC enterprise-wide Novell LAN infrastructure. Multi-Level authentication and authorization is a function of UNIX NIS, Windows Domain management, and Novell LDAP services. Hardcopy production equipment includes Xerox DocuTech high volume production printers with a wide-range of in-line finishing options, Xerox DigiPath and Epson scanning sub-systems, Canon high performance CLC color printers with PostScript RIPs and centralized production control workstations, Canon and ColorSpan large format color plotters, and mid-range black and white departmental printers from Hewlett-Packard, and Xerox. All printers support direct LAN connection via TCP/IP 100base-T Ethernet, and hostname resolution is accomplished via centralized DNS servers.
Application Software
EPS application software includes a wide-range of general and task specific software solutions running under IBM AIX, Sun Solaris, and/or Microsoft Windows 2000. Key applications are configured to interoperate across multiple hardware/software platforms. Specific application packages supported by the NFC EPS include: Broadvision/Interleaf Quicksilver technical publishing software; Quicksilver, Microsoft Word 2003, ArborText, and XMLSpy XML authoring applications; XMLSpy and XML Authority XML Schema Design tools; Broadvision/Interleaf DemandPrint 2 demand print management Software; SunONE Web Server Enterprise Edition 6; Communigate Pro e-mail server; Adobe Illustrator, Adobe PhotoShop, and Paint Shop Pro graphic design applications; Elixir and Formatta forms development solutions; Macromedia DreamWeaver and Adobe Acrobat web publishing applications; Crunchy Technologies Page Screamer, Cast Bobby, and IBM Page Reader Section 508 compliance tools; FH Premier context sensitive help authoring tools; TechSmith SnagIt screen capture facility; and Microsoft Office 2000 and Office 2003 desktop productivity suites.

OBJECTIVE: NFC requires contractor support services to implement XML publishing extensions to the NFC Electronic Publishing System (EPS), as described in the section below, titled XML Document Publishing Architecture, and create a mechanism for converting existing document based information to non-proprietary XML formats. XML specific EPS functionality will include: XML document Authoring with an XML compliant COTS authoring tool, XML document management, Bill-of-Materials based document assembly, and dynamic re-purposing of XML based content, to generate all required document information deliverables. Document deliverables supported by the XML pilot will include: HTML documents, PDF documents, and web based on-line help for NFC developed applications.
SCOPE: This SOW is to acquire the required contractor support services to implement enhancements to the NFC EPS and complete the XML Pilot on or before September 30, 2004. The contractor will provide on-site support at NFC¡¦s facility located in New Orleans, Louisiana.  
XML DOCUMENT PUBLISHING ARCHITECTURE: The EPS XML Document Publishing Architecture (XDPA) will consist of a combination of existing NFC IT resources, COTS applications, and open source document processing technologies. The solution will be platformed on, and implemented as an extension of, the NFC Electronic Publishing System (EPS) and GESB web publishing infrastructure. Specific solution components will include:  
Document Content Authoring
All GESB document content will be authored and managed in XML using XML enabled desktop authoring applications. Specific authoring tools will be selected after a thorough review of available COTS products. Leading contenders include Microsoft Word 2003, Broadvision Quicksilver, and XMLSpy Authentic.
Document Content Management
GESB's XML solution will store XML instance documents in a managed document repository integrated with the XML authoring tool. The planned solution will support two types of XML formatted documents:
ƒÞ	Documentation Topic documents that contain help content and supporting metadata for a single NFC application screen or lower level Unit of Work (UOW), and

ƒÞ	Publication Bill-of-Materials documents that define Documentation Topic assembly criteria for the generation of serialized documentation deliverables.
Help content stored in each Documentation Topic document will include field level roll-over help, field level stick-up help, and Unit of Work level help for the associated application screen or lower level UOW. 
Document Deliverable Generation
Document deliverables will be dynamically assembled, transformed, and formatted from stored XML document content using open source document processing technologies, including XSLT (eXtensible Style Language Transform), XSL-FO (eXtensible Style Language Formatting Objects), and Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor).
XSLT, XSL-FO, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) transformation and formatting definitions will be authored and tested by GESB publishing specialists using desktop XML design and prototyping tools such as XMLSpy. 
Supported documentation deliverables will include: single topic HTML and PDF web site content, serialized publication PDF data, and web based help collection HTML formatted content. 
DESCRIPTION OF WORK
Contractor services for the XML Documentation and On-line help Pilot will fall into five categories:  
Document Reengineering
Assist GESB personnel in analyzing and re-engineering one or two existing publications for non-serialized authoring and XML production. The analysis and reengineering process will include the identification of addressable document structures and the designation of an appropriate XML Unit of Work (UOW).  Revised authoring standards will be developed, as required.
XML Schema Development
Design, develop, and test XML document schemas for Document Topic and Publication Bill-of-Materials instance documents that support the non-serialized document standards defined during the document reengineering process.
XML Document Publishing Architecture (XDPA) implementation
Evaluate XML authoring tools including Microsoft Word 2003, Broadvision Quicksilver, and XMLspy Authentic. 
Design, develop, and test authoring tool based XML content check-in and check-out facility.
Design, develop, and test XSLT, XSL-FO, and CSS style sheets to support XML document content repurposing. Documentation deliverables will include: single topic HTML and PDF web site content, serialized publication PDF data, and web based help collection HTML formatted content.
Integrate the document repurposing and content delivery facility with the SunONE web server and existing GESB managed intranet web site.
Legacy Content Conversion
Convert existing document content of selected publications to XML. Develop required XML schema element mappings and translations for Quicksilver and Word 2003.
Parse and enhance XML document content to create non-serialized Documentation Topics with required metadata and document content extensions.
Design, develop, and test Publication Bill-of-Materials instance documents for selected publication(s).

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGER as CONTRACTOR (CMc) PROCUREMENT FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE EMANUEL CELLER U.S. COURTHOUSE, BROOKLYN, NY.  The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby issues a Pre-Solicitation Notice under which the GSA is publicizing our intention to contract for the Construction Services for the Modernization of the Emanuel Celler United States Courthouse in Brooklyn, NY.  

GSA intends to contract for complete construction services for the modernization of the Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse, with general construction contractors (GC) that offer the best overall value to the Government.  The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The existing U.S. Courthouse is an eight-story structure with a gross area of 30,096 square meters (324,000 square feet) and houses district courtrooms, magistrate hearing rooms, court support facilities and other tenants. Currently a new U.S. Courthouse is under construction at this site and will be permanently linked to the existing courthouse.  The Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse contains 10 district courtrooms and chambers and 1 special proceedings courtroom, some of which will continue to be utilized by the District Court during construction. The project will include asbestos removal, interior construction, new secured corridors, ceilings and lightings, installation of a building sprinkler system (the building does not have one) and replacement of the fire alarm system, replacement of the roof, repairs to the façade, upgrade of HVAC distribution and electrical systems, modernization of the elevators, window replacement, seismic upgrade and progressive collapse protection, and installation of handicapped accessibility features to meet ADA requirements.  THIS WORK WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PHASING DUE TO THE PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING.  

General Contractors interested in submitting a proposal for this project are encouraged to submit a letter of interest. The letter may be sent to the Contracting Officer, Francis Cashman, 271 Cadman Plaza East, 3rd Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11201, via facsimile at (718) 330-2043, or via e-mail to francis.cashman@gsa.gov.  Please contact Mr. Mohammed Abdulghani at (718) 330-2030 for any inquiries. The Request For Proposals (RFP) will be issued in Fedbizopps on or about three weeks from the posting of this announcement.  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $64,000,000 to $74,000,000.  A Pre-Proposal Conference/Small Business Subcontractor Network Session is set for Thursday, September 9, 2004 at 2:00 pm in the Central Jury Room, Room # 143 at the Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY 11201.  Any questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria will be addressed at the Pre-Proposal Conference.  Any scope changes by the Government that may result from the pre-proposal conference may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  A Small Business Subcontractor Network Session is scheduled to immediately follow the Pre-Proposal Conference.  The Network Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering proposing on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  

This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  This project is in and will use Metric Units of Measure.  The general construction contractor selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, supervision and constructability reviews during the A-E's Design Phase to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than price.  

The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR 16.2), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the Offeror that provides the best overall value to the Government.  The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered.  The procurement process will have Two Stages.  

In Stage I, Technical proposals and the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be evaluated and the competitive range will be established in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(1). Then, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), based on the results of the evaluation, the Contracting Officer will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. For this procurement, the competition will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated proposals.  The Technical Factors for Stage One are as follows:  (1) Offeror's Experience on Similar Projects (2) Offeror's Past Performance on Similar Projects and (3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel.  The submission of price will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data.  This price should reflect the contractor's Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for General Contractor Services. 

In Stage II the GC’s shall perform construction document reviews and evaluations of the A-E’s Design Phase thru the 50% Construction Document (CD) Phase and make a technical and price submission.  The Technical Factors for Stage Two are as follows: (1) Construction Document Review with Written Comments (2) Detailed Project Management and Technical Approach and (3) Construction Process/Management Presentation.  The submission of a GMP for the Construction Option will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data. The offerors must also develop and propose a firm-fixed-price for the Construction Document Review Services through the 100% Completion of all Documents.  Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvements measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage II become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the project at no recompense to the offeror.  

In conjunction with the submission of revised technical and price proposals, the offeror is required in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-9 to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. This mandatory proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR 19.705-4, should encompass the following minimum Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Businesses (48%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (10%), Women-Owned Small Businesses (7%), Hub Zone Small Businesses (3%), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (3%), and Veteran Owned Small Businesses (4%). The Contractor’s Small Business Subcontracting Plan shall meet the requirements in accordance with FAR 19.704.  The GSA reserves the right to contact agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, to inquire about the offerors past performance regarding small business subcontracting plans/goals.  Information regarding small and small disadvantaged business subcontracting opportunities may be found at the Small Business Administration website: www.sba.gov.

At the end of Stage II, the three (3) most highly rated offerors remaining in the competitive range that fully participated in the competition will be provided a stipend of $50,000 each for their total effort for the services rendered during this stage. At the end of Stage II, the 50% CD Phase, an award will be made to one of the three offerors in the competitive range based on the criteria in the Solicitation.

The selected general contractor (GC) will then participate as a member of the team for the Construction Document Review Services through 100% completion of all documents. The selected general contractor (GC) is to develop a Level 5 Estimate, sufficient to demonstrate the documented value of the Project based on their experience, conversations with their subcontractors and any other means necessary to verify current costing. The estimate will be submitted, in writing, to GSA for their review and consideration and any ideas, problems or information can be utilized to improve the design process. The selected general contractor will submit a list of critical subcontractors. Subcontractors critical to the project including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, roofing, abatement, and fire protection will be asked to participate in this construction document review phase.  Subcontractors will be included in this phase for their technical input and in order to come up with a more accurate firm-fixed price and firm schedule.  All of the critical subcontractors must meet the minimum technical qualifications of the specifications in order to participate.      

The selected general contractor (GC) and the approved critical subcontractors shall participate in 100% & Final Construction Documents, perform a final construction document review with a submission of written comments and participate in all project meetings.  The GC will accept and validate the 100% Construction Documents. The GC must utilize the pricing policy regarding shell and tenant improvements.  GSA pricing policy will be provided to the offerors. Based on the GC’s estimate and any final discussions with the Government, the GC shall provide a firm fixed price for the Construction Phase Option. In conjunction with the submission of the price proposal, the GC is required in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-9 to submit an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan. If GSA determines that the construction option price is reasonable, GSA will exercise the option for the construction of the project and issue Notice to Proceed. Construction duration is approximately 182 weeks or less as mutually accepted after the completion of the construction document review for the 100% completion of all documents. The Option for the Construction Contract will be contingent upon the availability of funds. 

Closing will be at GSA Small Business Utilization Center, 18th Floor; Room 18-110, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278 at 3:00 P.M. Local Time on October 7, 2004, Telephone: (212) 264-1235.

<DESC>Engineering Field Activity Southeast/ROICC Jacksonville is seeking interest from 8(a) firms participants with bona-fide places of business in the northeast Florida area or southeast Georgia area within 50 miles of Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay. The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Basic Ordering Agreement's (BOA's). The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the US Small Business Administration (SBA)district offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between EFASE/ROICC (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA, and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the NAVY and SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) the usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual document, i.e. task order, will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $2,500.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000.00. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $100,000.00 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order over $25,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire services from he BOA holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types. EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc. exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems. MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical or mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications. DESIGN: On-site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items. The NAICS sub sectors assigned to the subject BOA requirements are 233,234,235,236,237 and 238. Each BOA may also contain a sole source provision to authorize the acquisition of emergency repairs and solutions to emergency calls relative to design/build services for minor construction items. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Engineering Field Activity Southeast (EFASE) area of responsibility, including NAS Jacksonville, NS Mayport, and Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. IF a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the BOIA holder and the BOA will terminate. Termination of the BOA under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the BOA with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued orders. The BOA holders maybe required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:(1) Provide 8(a) Certification and applicable district or an 8(a) participant with a bona-fide place of business in either location; (2) Registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; contractors may visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/ for information on registering and checking the CCR; (3)Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Codes stated above which will be identified with each potential task order requirement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for fuels management services to accomplish the following: Reduce fuels in the forests so that a wildfire would burn at lower intensity and would not generate the energy to loft firebrands onto historic structures. Reduce fuel loading and forest stand densities to the point that the residual stand would not support a crown fire. Reduce the potential wildfire intensity such that fire crews could safely combat a wildfire. Reduce fuels within 40 meters of flammable structures so that radiant heat from a wildfire would not ignite the structure. Create a defensible space around historic structures to provide for safety of firefighters. Retain the visual and recreational values of the ghost towns. Complete proposed treatments while protecting cultural resources, structures, and artifacts from damage or loss.  This project is an initial 26 acre test area that will be used to determine the effectiveness of various techniques designed to reduce fuels while avoiding damage to cultural resources.

It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to procure professional support services for the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) on a sole source basis from American Educational Research Association, Washington, D.C.  The OBSSR plans to provide support to the Social and Behavioral Sciences Working Group on Human Research Protections for continued work on human research ethics in the behavioral and social sciences.  The goal of the Working Group's activities is to promote efforts to improve the human research protection system through outreach to the scientific community, develop human subject protection courses, and prepare reports that seek to improve understanding of how social and behavioral science research can best operate within the human research protections system.  The activities of the Working Group include conducting a day-long course, producing reports, and disseminating its products.  The OBSSR has worked closely with the Social and Behavioral Sciences Working Group on Human Research Protections over the past two years in identifying needs of the research community and gaps in the understanding or implementation of human research protection systems.  Ultimately, the Working Group has produced important work products, reached out across the social and behavioral science community to gain input and enhanced consideration of human research protection in these sciences, and has designed a day-long course focused on human research ethics.  The objective of the Working Group's efforts is to continue promoting education and training in the area of human research ethics and the best practices for review of such research.  The objectives of the Working Group will be accomplished through presentations, courses, report-writing, and dissemination efforts.  The Social and Behavioral Sciences Working Group on Human Research is housed in the American Educational Research Association (AERA), a major interdisciplinary research organization in the behavioral and social sciences.  The Working Group is chaired by Dr. Felice Levine, Executive Director of AERA, and is comprised of seventeen highly experienced social and behavioral scientists from numerous executive branch agencies and academia.  The Working Group brings considerable expertise in human research ethics ensuring its goals will be met.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work.

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby issuing a Sources Sought for Infrared Dichroic Beamsplitters for AstroBiology Explorer (ABE).  Statement of Work: The vendor shall design and manufacture dichroic beamsplitters according to the specifications outlined below. As part of this procurement, the vendor shall also provide in-house "baseline" performance testing (including cryogenic) to demonstrate that the beamsplitters were made to the outlined specifications. More detailed tests will be performed at NASA Ames. Where applicable, the cost quoted for the beamsplitters should include representative test coupons to be delivered to NASA Ames as part of the procurement. The beamsplitters are to be delivered to NASA Ames on/before October 1, 2004. The vendor shall also provide a delivery schedule for the beamsplitter products, and inform NASA Ames of any modifications to the original procurement schedule. The purchase will be costed as a fixed-cost contract. As part of their bid, the vendor will provide a breakdown of (1) a basic cost quote for Beamsplitter #1 and Beamsplitter #2, quantity 1-each, (2) a delta cost for one additional quantity of each beamsplitter, and (3) detailed costs for any supporting design study, tooling activity, etc. In addition, the vendor shall provide any detailed explanations of exceptions/clarifications if the proposed deliverable cannot meet the specifications. The vendor shall also provide a detailed list of in-house tests to be performed and how these tests will verify performance required. Depending on the cost and performance estimates for the beamsplitters received, NASA Ames will procure one or two beamsplitters from chosen vendor. Specifications: The two AstroBiology Explorer (ABE) beamsplitters are both in collimated space and are part of an infrared cryogenic (T &lt; 20 K) spectrometer. They must separate light into 2.5-5 um, 5-10 um, and 10-20 um) spectral ranges. Although the order of the beamsplitters to split the light is not a static design parameter, the following specifications have been made for the current ABE optical design, shown schematically in a figure available upon request. The end result is to separate 2.5-5 um, 5-10 um, and 10-20 um light with high throughput and no dropouts/gaps between restricted wavelength regions.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform the vendor community of the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) intention to increase the maximum dollar ceiling of its Enterprise Technology Services Contract (ETSC) with Lockheed Martin Information Technology (Lockheed) by $13.3 million.  The current ceiling was based on an assumption that the ETSC would end for non-Medicare related work on September 30, 2004 and continue for Medicare related work through the contract’s original ending date of January 31, 2006. The award of a replacement contract has been delayed because of the extent of competition that has been generated.  The current contract for non-Medicate related work will continue until a replacement contract is awarded during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2005 and a transition is completed not later than January 31, 2005.

This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  Pricing data is not requested or required.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information.  Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically by July 27, 2004 to tina.honey@sssa.gov and refer to the TH ETSC Modification.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Increment I system must be Key Performance Parameters (KPP) compliant by Initial Operation,  Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E).   On 29 March 2004, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) released to industry a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) Number W58RGZ-04-R-0467 on a full and open competitive basis for the U.S. Army ERMP UAV System.  Draft RFP W58RGZ-04-R-0467 was issued for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback on its content and acquisition approach.  Further amendments to the draft RFP may be issued as necessary until the formal RFP is issued.  On 05 May 2004, AMCOM conducted a pre-proposal conference in Huntsville , Alabama to answer industry questions and comments concerning the ERMP acquisition. AMCOM plans to issue formal RFP Number W58RGZ-04-R-0674 on a full and open competitive basis for the U.S. Army ERMP UAV System on or about 05 August 2004 with proposals due on or about 20 September 2004. A best value approach will be used in source selection.  The competition will be conducted in two phases, with the first phase resulting in contracts awarded to up to two offerors to demonstrate their systemÃ¢Â€Â™s capabilities.  The second phase will resu lt in a contract awarded to one offeror to enter into a System Design and Development phase and production of test assets.  The UAV PM has established an informational web site at http://www.tuav.redstone.army.mil/ermp2 .  The web site will contain the RFP, attachments, exhibits and other ERMP UAV program information.  To access the web site you must have a login and password.  To request a login/password, please submit an email to Michael.Hicks@peoavn.redstone.army.mil .

The Contractor must have  the capability and experience to perform, or provide, a wide range of investigative, remedial design, remedial construction, and remediation services required for hazardous substance and waste sites, munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), and chemical  warfare materiel (CWM).  Work may include, for example, site investigation, site characterization, study, evaluation, remedial design, MEC escort, avoidance, and construction support, remedial construction, remediation of contaminated sites, and monitorin g.  It is the Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  In addition, contractors must fulfill the performance objectives of this PWS in a manner that is consistent with any applicable orders o r permits, all previously agreed-upon and future cleanup agreements or guidance for the Installation, and relevant Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policy.  Contractor must perform all the necessary environmental restoration work as required to meet th e performance objectives of this PWS.  Remediation is being conducted pursuant to Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and National Oil and Ha zardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP) requirements, with regulatory coordination of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and may include the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  Additionally work may be conducted pu rsuant to Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) or other applicable authorities.  Contractor should note that, for the purposes of this PWS, the contractor is responsible for remediation of the chemical hazards at the listed sites, but not the explosiv e safety hazards associated with MEC.  The contractor is responsible for MEC avoidance and construction support to the extent that it is required for the site characterization and remedial activities.  Negotiations between NGB and ADEQ allow for a separate  Remedy In Place (RIP) and Response Complete (RC) determination based on chemical hazards alone.  This procurement is set-aside as an 8 (a) Competitive Action.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 562910 with a standard size o f 12M.  A Firm Fix Price Contract is contemplated.  A site visit will be scheduled for this requirement approximately 2 weeks after the issuance of the solicitation.

<SOLNBR>3741
<RESPDATE>072904
<CONTACT>RHONDA ROBINSON, 202-493-4356
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System Sec.3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform GSA Schedule 70 vendors of FAAs intent to contract with a selected source via single source procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration intends to enter into a Single Source Contract with Titan Corporation to provide specialized Engineering and Technical Services to the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program (VDRP) for a period one year, with options for two additional years. The ASAP is a voluntary safety reporting program for employees of Part 121 & 145 certificate holders that is established through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the FAA and which may entail the identification of possible regulatory violations by the employer, as well as by the reporting employee.  The VDRP is a voluntary reporting program for certificate holders and production approval holders operating under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  Those organizations may report their own possible violations, including violations identified through the ASAP, under the VDRP, subject to acceptance and tracking by the FAA of a comprehensive fix to prevent reoccurrence of the violation by the reporting organization. Titan has designed, developed, and is in the midst of  implementing an ISO9001 compliant prototype electronic information management system for ASAP to enable the tracking and archiving of ASAP MOUs, revisions thereto, FAA acceptance letters, renewal due dates, and quality assurance program reviews, as well as a data base of safety enhancements, including comprehensive fixes to voluntary disclosures,  achieved through ASAP and reported on a quarterly basis by FAA certificate holding district offices. Titan has designed and is in the midst of developing software to enable a new web-based venue for operator VDRP submissions, and for FAA processing of those submissions in accordance with the steps identified in FAA Advisory Circular 00-58.  The system will also provide a secure national database of all VDRP submissions at every stage of their processing.  Further, it will automatically update the limited data fields for voluntary disclosures presently in the FAA's Enforcement Information System (EIS) in order to maintain the utility of that legacy system, while enabling much more detailed voluntary disclosure information tracking in the new system.  Titan has coordinated with the FAA Information Technology staff at the FAA Aeronautical Center to assure the software under development will interface appropriately with the EIS for voluntary disclosure input. Similarly, Titan has accomplished the necessary coordination to enable software design and interface for automatically populating the new VDRP system with information already available in other FAA databases (e.g. automated operations specifications). Software development for the preceding efforts is 65% complete, and beta testing, including testing of interface with EIS and related FAA databases, is planned to begin before the end of Fiscal Year 2004, upon completion of version 1 of the software system.  In order to maintain continuity at this critical stage of program development, and to avoid the program delay that would otherwise ensue were the current development team to be replaced at the expiration of the current period of performance, the FAA intends to award a sole source contract to Titan. These programs require continued development to ensure proper implementation and rollout to the national user community.  The ASAP and VDRP programs are required to ensure that valid information is collected, aggregated, and analyzed to identify safety issues across the airline industry before they become major problems. This project requires a contractor with specific knowledge and experience with the ASAP and VDRP, and that offers strong technical qualifications to provide systems design and modeling, systems integration, network analysis, technical consulting, prototyping, document management and data access, internet development, business process re-engineering, office automation systems, configuration management and hardware and software recommendations.  More detailed descriptions of the types of professional services required are provided in the attached Statement of Work. During the period of performance for the present acquisition, the FAA will conduct a market analysis to determine if other vendors can support future stages of this effort, or portions thereof.  It is the FAA's intention to conduct a competition for future requirements to support the ASAP and VDRP systems, once initial operating capability has been successfully demonstrated.      Interest vendors may respond by July 29, 2004 @ 3:00 p.m.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Rhonda F. Robinson, Contract Specialist, by  Facsimile responses are not permitted.  Electronic responses can be sent to the following e-mail address: rhonda.f.robinson@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Washington Detachment, intends to award a sole-source contract to Kongsberg Satellite Services of Tromso, Norway to procure Synthetic Aperture Radar  Images.   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is the only high-resolution data source capable of penetrating the perpetual cloud cover and illuminating conditions unique to the polar regions.   This equipment helps the Naval Ice Center’s (NIC) continue their mission to provide worldwide operational sea ice analyses forecasts for the armed forces of the Department of Defense, Allied Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Transportation and other U.S. government and international agencies.  Use of the SAR data to monitor conditions for the region is essential.   The SAR Radar Satellite (RADARSAT) is the first satellite designed for operational sea ice analysis.  Its C band (5.3 GHz) HH polarized SAR sensor provides complete Arctic coverage at 100 meter resolution.   The SAR ‘s  beam steering capabilities allow coverage over a 500 km swath at 100 meter resolution.   Current technology allows creation of ice classification, concentration and motion products, which greatly aid in production of a wide variety of ice information and decision making products.  The Kongsberg International Satellite Station has limited on-board recording capabilities that allow the satellite to “see” ground stations and to download the imagery.   The Kongsberg ground station located in Norway is also an ideal location for NIC to collect resolution data for the polar regions.   A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared.  The period of performance is anticipated to be from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005, with four (4) one-year options.  The SIC Code is 4899.  See Note 22.  Solicitation number N00600-05-R-0003 will be available approximately 9 June 2004 and can be downloaded from http://www.neco.navy.mil.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.
PROPOSAL SUMISSION PLACE:
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the El Salvadoran Ministerio de Economía (MINEC), in the assessment and design of a new national import processing system.

In Trade Capacity Building related discussions with the El Salvadoran delegation to the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement negotiations, government Ministries and private trade associations, a common hurdle emerged focused on severe inefficiencies related to the processing of imported goods into the country.  To compete more effectively, the government of El Salvador is engaging several e-government initiatives, and related to trade capacity building, the National Import Processing System project is high on the priority list.  The current process to import goods into El Salvador is an antiquated and cumbersome system which is in need of revision if El Salvador wishes to better compete in the regional economy.  

CENTREX as a mechanism was created to promote exports by centralizing and simplifying the administrative process that govern the export process.  For example, in 1997, the processing of a paper-based export application took between five and fifteen days to process. In 2001 with the implementation of CENTREX, a web-based export application system, the processing time was reduced to five minutes per application.

While CENTREX has achieved the original objectives set forth, there are some constraints within the regulatory framework that governs the system.  One such constraint is that the regulatory framework only addresses exports and does not provide the same services for imports.  This is significant given that fact that 95% of exporters are also importers of raw materials and components used to manufacture goods that are then exported.  The current application process for import documentation is neither automated nor centralized and thus results in lengthy delays in processing imports, which increases the cost of such imports.

Based on the success of computerizing the export application function, MINEC is now seeking to implement an import functionality into CENTREX and improve the import processing efficiency on the same level as exports processing.  This will allow MINEC to consolidate all export and import processing and reporting functions into one integrated information system.  The benefits of the new information system will provide companies with the ability to submit import and export applications online.  Additionally, companies will be able to search for individual records and related documentation while the MINEC and other government agencies will have access to real-time statistics and have the ability to track trade related quotas.  

This project is considered one of the highest Trade Capacity Building initiatives for El Salvador.  The development and implementation of a national import application processing information system will create a streamlined and efficient process for importing foreign goods. USTDA support of the National Import Processing System project is consistent with our Trade Capacity Building efforts under the spirit of the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement.

The objective of this project is to develop a new software application that automates the documentation required for importing goods into El Salvador.  It is envisaged that the new system will streamline import processing procedures for the entire country.  Additionally, the import software application will be integrated with the existing export information system, CENTREX.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following:

Task 1: Define, procure and install server and development systems at MINEC. 
Task 2: Develop project plan review of information flow, database and developer training as necessary.
Task 3: Develop functional specifications for the information system.
Task 4: Develop an implementation plan detailing timeline and milestones.
Task 5: Develop conceptual and logical design for database model.
Task 6: Develop initial version of the application.
Task 7: Conduct testing of the application with users and retest as necessary.
Task 8: Conduct staff and user training.
Task 9: Deploy live system with monitoring of usage and performance.
Task 10: Complete systems documentation/documents designed for staff and administrators.
Task 11: Train staff in support, maintenance, backup, and recovery procedures.
Task 12: Evaluate the project with quantifiable performance and evaluation methodology. 
  	   Submit final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $387,492 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm local San Salvador, El Salvador time, August 23, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

·	Note:  All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually.  Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.

3.  Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).
·	The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company.  You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm.
·	To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on “Search CCR.”  Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click “Submit Query.”  If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.
·	Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.  There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC.  If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet.  If you see that there is no one listed as your company’s EB POC, you need to click on “Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN” to add it.
·	Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC’s (primary and alternate) for each CAGE/DUNS combination.
·	The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor’s organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.
·	Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.  Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete.  For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html

4.  Establish a group in WAWF-RA associated with your cage code(s).  This can be 
     done by calling DISA-Ogden Customer Support at 1-800-392-1798 or by
     e-mailing cscassig@ogden.disa.mil

5.  Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM).  (Proceed to paragraph 6 if you are not going to designate a GAM).
·	In medium to large sized companies, there may be need to establish more than one GAM.
·	A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account.
·	The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC.  To appoint additional GAM’s, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC.
·	The appointment letter should be faxaed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	The Group Administrator’s Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.
·	The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.

6.  Establish an organizational e-mail address
·	All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes, the system generates an e-mail notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm’s organizational e-mail account.
·	The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational e-mail to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	Ensure that your firm’s organizational e-mail address is operational and can receive e-mail from WAWF-RA prior to registering your e-mail address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	Note:  If you do not set up an organizational e-mail address, the personal e-mail address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational e-mail address for your firm.

7.  Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA
·	Set up the PCs of your organization’s users to access WAWF-RA.
·	Select the “Setting Up Your Machine” link on the WAWF-RA home page.  For more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.

8.  Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA website
·	Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA website by completing the on-line registration form.
·	Select the “Self Register” link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions.
·	Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate.  Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering.
 
·	PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operation Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com.  The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate.
·	If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center. 
·	Note:  Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an e-mail from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR database.

9.  Follow-Up (If necessary).
·	If your (GAM or user) account hasn’t been activated within two business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:

<DESC>IDAHO NATIONAL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS CAPABLE OF COMMERCIALIZING METHODS FOR RECOVERY OF DAUGHTER ISOTOPES FROM A SOURCE.  Announcement:  Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), operated by Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI) under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners capable of developing and implementing BBWI proprietary methods for recovery of daughter isotopes from a source and delivering the recovered daughter isotopes to the medical community for clinical trials, therapeutic treatments or both, and who are interested in entering into a license agreement, research and development agreement, or both, for the purpose of developing and commercializing a method to recover daughter isotopes for human therapeutic applications.  License terms would include an up-front licensing payment, minimum annual royalties and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  A research and development agreement would be under a standard CRADA arrangement with an option for licensing subject inventions.   Note:  THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY BBWI TO ENTER INTO EITHER A LICENSE AGREEMENT OR A COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITH ANY COMPANY.   A description of the technology follows:  INEEL scientists have identified two distinct proprietary methods for recovery of daughter isotopes from more than 10 metric tons of source material.  Both methods result in the recovery of Actinium 225 from the source material, which includes mixed thorium isotopes containing about 40 grams of Thorium 229.  More details will be available to qualified companies under a nondisclosure agreement.  The successful company will be expected to be capable of a) funding a pilot-plant development of one or both methods, b) funding development and operation of a commercial process for recovery of Actinium 225 from this source, and c) providing Actinium 225 to the medical community for use in clinical trials, therapeutic treatments or both.  Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing BBWI's Methods for Recovery of Daughter Isotopes from a Source should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following: 1) company name and address; 2) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address for a point of contact; 3) a brief description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology; and 4) a brief description of how the company might commercialize this technology.  The statement of interest should be made by US mail or e-mail and should be received within 30 days of publication of this opportunity at the following address: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Advisory Account Executive, Technology Outreach, BBWI, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805. E-mail is snydjr@inel.gov.

This industry comprises government establishments primarily engaged in providing general support for government. Such support services include personnel services, election boards, and other general government support establishments that are not classified elsewhere in public administration. 
No number notes apply.
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find adequate staff to cover all positions in the field on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART) and assessment teams, and in Washington on the Response Management Teams (RMT) and backfill for those permanent staff deploying to the field in a timely manner. OFDA’s Senior Management Team (SMT) then approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 130 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA’s response to disasters.

<DESC>Computer simulation, operation and scenario generation and modeling technical support services are sought for the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC), formerly known as the Theater Aerospace Command and Control Simulation Facility (TACCSF).  Organizations having capabilities in the areas of military operational expertise in the weapons systems identified below, computer simulation requirements definition, exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to submit their qualifications for consideration.  The DMOC, located at Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), New Mexico, has live, constructive and virtual operator-in-the-loop simulators which are used to replicate the all C2ISR elements in the vertical chain from decision maker to shooter for training, CONOPS development, mission rehearsal, RDT&E and studies and analysis,. DMOC currently includes (in alphabetical order):  Airborne Laser Simulator (ABL), Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS),  Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS), AN/TQY-23 Operations Module, Airspace Control and Operations Training (ASCOT), ASTi Enhanced Dialogue Digital Audio Comm System, Airborne Warning and Control System Simulator (legacy)(AWACS), Airborne Warning and Control System Simulator (Plexsys MTC)(AWACS), Common Connectivity Device (CCD), Cobra Ball Simulator, Distributed Information Warfare Constructive Environment (DICE), Data Collection/Posttest Subsystem, Data Link Simulator, Data Loggers, Distributed Interactive Simulation Filter, Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSim), Extended Air Defense Battlespace (EADTB), F-15C/E Weapons and Tactics Trainer (WTT), F-16 Desktop Simulator, High-Level Architecture (HLA) Gateway, Improved Multi-Link Translator and Display System (IMTDS), Joint Surveillance, Tracking and Reconnaissance System (JSTARS) Simulator, Joint STARS Work Station, Joint Tactical and Conflict Tactical Simulator (JCATS), Link-16/Gateway Terminal Emulator, Mapper, Master Simulation (MSIM), META VR Stealth Viewer, Missile Defense System Exerciser Remote Environment, Missile Tracker / Correlator System, Modular Control Equipment Simulator, Master Simulation Gateway, Next Generation Threat System (NGTS), Portable Flight Planning Software, REDSIM (DIS Logger), Scenario Generation System (SGS),  Scenario Toolkit and Generation Environment (STAGE) , Simulation Cell (White Force), Space Simulation, Tactical Information Broadcast System(TIBS) Terminal Simulator, Theater Battle Management Corps System (TBMCS),.  

b.  The battlespace is designed with an open architecture to facilitate connection of these nodes to emulate a variety of Theater Air Defense (TAD) systems, and architecture for various theaters.  The battlespace is capable of simulating up to 10,000 simultaneous air and ground objects.  The largest current scenario is 60 geocells (60x60 nautical miles each). Digital data bases (DTED,DFAD, and imagery)are used for terrain. The effects of electronic countermeasures (ECM) and atmospheric phenomenon are also modeled.  

c.  The DMOC is linked to many military simulation facilities through T-1 lines and ATM clouds.  DIS and HLA gateways and corresponding network components allow the DMOC to interface with a variety of joint, live, virtual, and constructive simulations.  Translators are available to allow exchange of tactical data link messages between actual field equipment and simulation models.  DMOC is also developing the capability to process live range data.  

d. The technical support will consist of operator and white force (Operators for the constructive simulations required to add realism and density to exercises and tests), support for tests and exercises, technical and analytical performance in support of the operation of the battlespace, technical and program management support, data collection, data reduction and analysis, test planning and reporting, requirements definition, currency analysis, system engineering, system software Quality Assurance/Configuration Control (QA/QC) and Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) tasks.  The contractor must be able to support surge requirements with appropriately skilled and cleared personnel, sometimes with little notice to support training and tests.   Major deliverables will include test schedules, plans, scenarios, after action reports, technical reports, system analysis, engineering analysis reports, engineering drawings and schematics. 

Contractual effort is contemplated to be a 60-month effort.  The estimated level of effort for this contract is 57,600 labor hours for the first year, increasing by 7680 hours per year thereafter for a total of 88,320 labor hours.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) seeks qualification packages from firms capable of providing a Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) Unit (TDU) for the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) Program.  The EFTS will use digital communication techniques and encryption to increase command link security and immunity to interference. National test ranges use flight termination systems (FTS) to maintain positive control over Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), launch vehicles and munitions in the event the vehicle goes off trajectory. The need to improve the current analog-based FTS was identified because of vulnerability to unauthorized users transmissions and signal interference. EFTS project began as the RS-38 study by the Range Commander’s Council (RCC) Range Safety Group (RSG) Flight Termination Standing Committee (FTSC).  The test range community conducted this study to determine what steps were necessary to maintain its excellent record of range safety.  Completed in March 2002, the study determined that the current systems were not adequate to meet the anticipated needs of current and future missions, and recommended a system be developed that: (1) maintains the main features of the current flight termination systems; (2) overcomes the security and interference deficiencies of existing systems, and; (3) provides capabilities that address the needs of current and future test programs.  Furthermore, the study prompted a recommendation from the National Security Agency (NSA) on the vulnerabilities of the existing systems.  Their recommendation stated that all new vehicles should move to a system that uses an NSA certified encryption algorithm coupled with a post-decryption authentication algorithm. The EFTS design is based on the result of the RS-38 study and the NSA recommendation. The RS-38 Final Report is located at the following URL: http://jcs.mil/RCC/manuals/EFTS/index.htm.  The scope of work required would consist of the development, manufacture, and test of a device called TDU.  The TDU will be a small, mechanically keyed plug-in-module that enters from the front panel on either the ground command transmitter system encoder or monitor.  The TDU will automatically attach the 2 digital (red and black) and 1 power interface connectors with the encoder or monitor. The two TDU digital interfaces are used to process command messages and encrypt or decrypt them.  Unencrypted messages are processed on the red interface, encrypted, and output on the black interface.  Encrypted messages are processed on the black interface, decrypted, and output on the red interface.  Requirements include: (1) design, document, manufacture, and test of TDES encryption and decryption circuitry; (2) design, document, manufacture, and test of TEMPEST related power supply circuitry; (3) design, document, manufacture, and test of TDES encryption key loading circuitry to interface with a standard key loading device such as the AN/CYZ-10 or AN/CYZ-10(v3), or DTD-2000 using DS-102 protocol; (4) design, manufacture, and test of a mechanical insertion and extraction approach for inserting the TDU into encoder or monitor device, including design interface for encoder and monitor connection; (5) Information Security (INFOSEC) procedures requiring a COMSEC account.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees.  The following criteria will be used to evaluate responses to this notice in order to determine whether or not this will be a full and open competition:  (1) experience designing encryption units based upon TDES; (2) COMSEC account; (3) experience designing mechanical systems for embedded applications; (4) experience developing highly reliable systems;  (5) experience in developing TEMPEST power supply designs; (6) experience interfacing to encryption key loading devices; (7) experience designing, developing, testing, and producing small quantity lots (less than 100) of equipment over multiple year contracts. Required qualification packages, in response to this sources sought synopsis, shall be limited to 15 pages and should include, as a minimum: (1) evidence of past experience and related projects that covers the aforementioned evaluation criteria, with value/price of past efforts; (2) the size of the firm (i.e. large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned business or veteran owned business); (3) whether or not these services are provided commercially to non-government agencies.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This notice is for planning purposes only.  This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice.  The qualification packages shall be sent via U.S. Mail, express/overnight deliveries, and/or courier service for receipt at Edwards AFB no later than 30 Jul 2004, addressed to:  Senah Williams, Contracting Officer, Directorate of Contracting, 5 South Wolfe Avenue, Building 2800, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185.  All questions must be submitted to Senah Williams, Contracting Officer, via email to: Senah.Williams@edwards.af.mil or by fax to: (661) 275-7806.   Telephone requests to be placed on a mailing list will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>Approach to Procure the Design and Fabrication of Rolling Stock (Cask and Buffer Cars) for the OCRWM Program
<DESC>NOTICE OF PROGRAM INTEREST SUBJECT:  Approach to Procure the Design and Fabrication of Rolling Stock (Cask and Buffer Cars) for the OCRWM Program AGENCY:   U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management _______________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY The Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this Notice of Program Interest (NOPI) to obtain input from rolling stock vendors regarding DOE¡¦s approach to procuring the design and fabrication of rolling stock for shipping spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) to a monitored geologic repository (MGR) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  DOE is responsible, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), for accepting and transporting spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactor sites and HLW and SNF from DOE facilities for ultimate disposal.  An overview of the program, including the anticipated project schedule, is provided in Appendix A.  DOE is considering the design and fabrication of the rolling stock needed for this purpose. The required rolling stock includes: a.) Cask Cars to carry HLW and SNF transportation casks, b.) Escort Cars to accommodate personnel accompanying the trains, c.) Buffer Cars to provide a physical separation between cars carrying SNF/HLW and those occupied by personnel, and d.) Locomotives to haul the cars. All of these vehicles, except the locomotives, must conform to American Association of Railroads (AAR) Performance Specification S-2043 (Appendix C). With this notice, the DOE seeks comments from rolling stock vendors concerning the appropriate structure for a procurement process that meets the objectives of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste management program and is attractive to potential bidders.  Your comments will help DOE refine the process and will provide a basis for the discussions with vendors in the initial stage of the process described below. Potential proposers are asked to provide feedback (that may be proprietary) to the Government on: a.) Commercially available technology that responds to Government requirements and strategy, b.) Issues that would discourage potential proposers from responding to the solicitation, and c.) Recommendations for improvement. This notice applies solely to Cask Cars and Buffer Cars.  Further details of the anticipated requirements for the Cask and Buffer Cars may be found in Appendices B1 and B2 (Appendices for this notice may be obtained at http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/wat/procure.shtml).  It is anticipated that DOE will select more than one vendor for these car types.  Each of the vendors will complete the design and fabrication of one prototype Cask Car and one prototype Buffer Car, test their respective prototype cars at the Transportation Test Center in Pueblo, CO and obtain certification of their designs by the AAR. It is then anticipated that vendors will be invited to submit proposals for final design and fabrication of a fleet of up to one hundred and twenty (120) Cask Cars and up to sixty (60) Buffer Cars in accordance with the certified designs.  DOE will then select the preferred design and manufacturer for the Cask and Buffer cars. DOE is planning to conduct this procurement in the following stages: 1. Meetings with individual vendors (August/September 2004) DOE will schedule meetings of up to two hours with individual designers and fabricators of rolling stock.  These meetings will allow potential proposers to share information with the DOE and obtain clarification of any of the issues outlined below.  Potential proposers may distribute written information regarding their products and capabilities for use during the meeting. After the meeting they may either collect their information or leave it for staff review.  If proprietary information is left with the DOE, the pages that are considered to be proprietary should be either stamped or headed to identify those pages.  The two-hour meetings will be held in August/September 2004. Vendors are allowed to bring no more than five people. The meetings will be held in the Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, Washington, D.C. DOE will schedule meetings with the points of contact identified on vendors¡¦ letters of interest. 2. Draft RFP (Late FY2004) It is anticipated that DOE will publish a Draft RFP on the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) for formal comments from the potential vendors and other interested parties. 3. Pre-Solicitation Conference (Early FY 2005) The DOE is planning to hold an open-forum meeting for all parties interested in this procurement.  The final time, place and other details will be announced on the FedBizOpps website and by e-mail to points of contact identified during the initial vendor meetings. 4. Final RFP (Early FY2005) It is anticipated that the DOE will publish the final Request for Proposals on the FedBizOpps website for vendor response. 5. Award(s) (FY2005) It is anticipated that the DOE will select a vendor or vendors FY2005. The Department is interested in vendor comments on the following issues. 1. Criteria for selecting design fabrication vendors.  DOE has initially identified the following selection criteria: a.) Technical capability to develop designs matching the unique characteristics of the Cask and Buffer Cars; b.) Cost-effectiveness of the design in fabrication, operation, and maintenance; c.) Prior successful history of designing and manufacturing similar types of railcars; d.) Ability to obtain certification for the new designs; e.) Corporate experience/past performance/record of integrity; f.) Corporate financial capacity and stability; g.) Qualifications of key personnel; and h.) Ability to meet schedule requirements.     ?X Are these selection criteria sufficient?     ?X Do you suggest modifications or additions? 2. Phases of the procurement.  DOE is considering this procurement of Cask and Buffer Cars to occur in two phases:  a.) Car Design / Prototype Fabrication and Testing:  Contractors shall individually provide  detailed designs, fabricate complete prototypes, complete analysis and testing at the  Transportation Test Center to demonstrate the designs¡¦ conformance with AAR Standard S-  2043, and obtain certificates of compliance from AAR.  The designs shall also demonstrate  quality attributes and safety provisions, performance characteristics and the operations and  maintenance concept and ability to be manufactured.  b.) Production:  A single contractor, selected from those that have completed the Car  Design / Prototype Fabrication and Testing phase, shall provide final designs incorporating  any changes required to obtain certification, as well as final design for production, and shall  fabricate the number of cars specified by DOE.    ?X Is this procurement phasing appropriate? Would another approach be advisable?  If        so, please describe.    ?X Are two discreet car designs necessary, or may it be possible, economical, or        practicable to design and manufacture one car type to fulfill the purposes of both the        Cask and Buffer Cars?   ?X What is your opinion of the level of interest among equipment designers and       manufacturers given DOE¡¦s proposed procurement approach?   ?X Would your firm be interested in responding to this solicitation given DOE¡¦s proposed       procurement approach (selection of multiple firms for design, development of a       prototype and testing and single selection of firm for manufacturing)?   ?X Would you need to team with other firms or can your firm individually respond to the RFP? 3. Commercial provisions:  Please address the optimal business, contractual and pricing arrangements that should be employed to meet design, prototype and fabrication requirements for these cars.  In particular address the following:  a.) Competition:  How competition can be maximized throughout the  design/prototype/fabrication process.  b.) Separate design: Please address whether, as an alternative, it is feasible and/or  advantageous for DOE to procure a design, followed by a separate contract for prototype  and fabrication.   ?X Would it be beneficial for the government to divide the procurement into separate       contracts for the Cask Cars and the Buffer Cars?   ?X If the Cask and Buffer Cars were built to different designs, would there be any      advantage or disadvantage to awarding the manufacture of Cask Cars to one supplier      and the manufacture of Buffer Cars to another?  Is the number of cars in the order a      factor into your response?   ?X Do you foresee any difficulty for potential contractors to obtain bonding for any phase(s)       of the project?   ?X Have you conducted business with the federal government before?   ?X Have you had any experiences that may cause you not to participate in this project?   ?X Have you learned any lessons that you care to share?   ?X Have you any suggestions for design issues that DOE should look out for? 4. Contract pricing:  DOE anticipates the use of Firm-Fixed-Price contract vehicles for all contract actions and phases.   ?X Would another approach such as time and materials or cost reimbursement be more       appropriate for a particular phase?  Please explain why another approach would be more       appropriate.   ?X What pricing terms allow for an equitable sharing of risk on each phase?   ?X Does your firm possess a government-approved accounting system that will allow the       use of cost reimbursement contracts?   ?X Do you have comments with respect to suitable pricing arrangements?   ?X Do you think that an incentive program to exceed scheduled project milestones is a mild       or strong motivator or any for that matter? In addition to addressing these questions please feel free to provide any other relevant input or suggestions regarding contract-pricing terms. 5. Information requirements:  Please define any other types of technical and commercial information / data vendors may need to enable a complete and competitive proposal to be submitted. 6. Collaboration:  To support DOE¡¦s Program¡Vwide objectives, contractors may be required to collaborate and interface with other vendors (e.g.: Escort Cars, Locomotives, vehicle testing at TTCI, Casks, Maintenance Facility) on a given task or requirement.  Please address how this collaboration may be achieved and the business considerations with other vendors that will limit the level of collaboration that is possible. 7. Performance incentives:  Please describe incentives that could be employed through a contract to encourage excellent performance, compliance with schedule requirements and cost reductions.  Where possible please discuss:  a.) The metrics that should be employed;  b.) The frequency and method of data collection associated with metrics; and  c.) Positive or negative financial actions associated with the metrics. 8. Regulatory requirements: Please identify any technology or regulatory challenges or barriers associated with the design, development and fabrication of the Cask Cars and Buffer Cars.  In particular, address the impact of AAR Standard S-2043 on the design and production of the Cask and Buffer Cars, whether as adaptations of existing designs or completely new designs. 9. On-going design efforts: Please identify any on-going design efforts directed toward the development of new or modified rolling stock that could be employed to meet the required Cask and Buffer Cars and consist functionalities. Appendices for this notice may be obtained at http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/wat/procure.shtml. Please provide your responses to the above questions by email in a Microsoft Word file to reggie.james@rw.doe.gov no later than August 6, 2004.  Please limit your comments and responses to no more than 10 pages.  No proprietary data should be included in data file that is submitted to the DOE. Cask and Buffer Car Vendor Meetings: The meeting to discuss DOE¡¦s approach for procuring Cask and Buffer cars is an opportunity for vendors to share ideas, suggestions and questions regarding this procurement with the DOE. Vendors may want to share information with DOE regarding corporate history and experience at these meetings.  This is appropriate to the extent that it is applicable to Cask and Buffer cars procurement.  It is expected that this portion of the vendor discussion will be limited to about ten minutes. During the proposal preparation process, the vendors will have the opportunity to submit a significant amount of information to the DOE on their corporate performance, abilities, experience and initiatives.  DOE will be able to learn more of the corporate qualifications as the proposals are evaluated. For the NOPI meetings, the DOE is focused on receiving input from the different vendors and organizations that will provide insight and direction for the DOE preparation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) which will determine the nature and type of contract that will be used for the procurement.  Therefore, the primary discussion for these meetings should be focused on the vendor¡¦s responses to the issues listed in the NOPI.  Vendors could discuss any suggestions for improvement, any foreseeable problems for the DOE, and any issues DOE may have omitted. With input gathered from the NOPI meetings, the DOE will prepare a draft RFP and publish it for comments.  The comments received on the draft will be incorporated into the final RFP as appropriate. The meetings will be held in the Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Ave. DOE will provide a laptop computer with PowerPoint, a projector connected to the computer and a screen for the meeting. Please complete the form in Appendix D as soon as possible and return by email to reggie.james@rw.doe.gov United States Department of Energy Office of Business Support Attention: Reggie R.

<SUBJECT>59 -- SINGLE FREQUENCY LASER
<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3), with Coherent Laser Group for a Solid State, Sealed, Single-Frequency Laser with the following technical specifications:
1) Power -6W Wavelength, 532nm Noise, less than 0.02% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz Linewidth less than 5MHz, single longitudinal mode, Power Stability  plus or minus 1% over 2 hours after a 15 minute warm-up, Pointing Stability  less than 5 urad/ degrees Celsius.      
2) The laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single-longitudinal-mode output. Systems based on a multi-axial design (MAD or QMAD) are not acceptable because of the mode-beating noise inherent in this design.  
3) The laser must have a noise performance of lower than 0.02% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz.  This low-noise performance is required for us to pursue our research goals.  
4) When replacing the pump laser diode modules, the laser head position and beam propagation path must not change, nor shall the laser cavity require any realignment or exposure to the laboratory environment.  Therefore, the pump diode module and the delivery fiber must detach from each other.  The delivery fiber must not detach at the laser head when replacing the laser pump diode module.  
5) The pump diodes must be manufactured using aluminum-free active area diodes.  Diodes using Al in the active region are unacceptable because of shortened lifetime caused by Al oxidation-induced optical failure.  
6) The laser system must automatically and continuously optimize the pump diode wavelength to maximize optical conversion efficiency.  Systems that use an assumed pre-programmed decay rate are unacceptable.  
7) All optical elements must be permanently fixed and aligned in the optical cavity for long term ease of use and reliability.  Adjustable optic mounts of any kind are unacceptable.  Furthermore, re-adjustment of laser optics must not be required if the pump laser is moved or repositioned.  
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions (NTE $100K). FAR Clauses in full text are available at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/. Based on our market research, Coherent is the only contractor who can meet these requirements. This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned.

<SUBJECT>R -- Assessment of Program Data Submitted by Participating Children's Hospitals to the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment Program
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis with Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BC&BS), 225 N. Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL 60601.  The purpose of the negotiation is to modify and expand the level of effort to contract 232-02-0005 in order to address one of the short-term performance goals set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and HRSA for the Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payment Program (CHGME PP) as a result of the PART.  One of the short-term goals set for the CHGME PP by the OMB and HRSA is to evaluate the feasibility and cost benefits of conducting 100 percent assessments of some of the other variables that are claimed and certified by participating children’s hospitals for purposes of CHGME PP indirect medical education payments.  The variables include the number of available beds, number of discharges, and case mix indices.  Under this contract modification, a pilot study will be designed and implemented to assess the inpatient available bed counts submitted to the CHGME PP by participating children’s teaching hospitals.  The long-term goals associated with the PART depend on the results of the cost benefit analysis.  The objective of this contract modification is not to conduct a cost benefit analysis but rather to conduct a pilot study to refine the protocol so as to increase efficiency, minimize burden, and assess processes which might reduce costs of carrying out the assessments.  This assessment protocol builds upon (1) the current Resident FTE Count Assessment process, conducted annually by CHGME Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs) under the existing BCBSA contract and (2) the current Medicare program assessment of inpatient available beds, which is directly applicable to two-thirds of the CHGME PP participating hospitals.  The Medicare and CHGME PP share many rules and regulations regarding the inpatient available bed counts, which contractors currently performing the resident FTE assessments are intimately familiar with.

BC&BS is deemed the only responsible source capable to fulfill the requirement without substantial duplication of costs which would not be expected to be recovered through competition under the authority in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source.  This is a notice of intent, not a request for competitive proposals.  The contact person is: Frantz Y. Richard, Contracting Officer, Contracts Operations Branch, Division of Procurement Management, OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857; phone number 301-443-0687; FAX 301-443-6038.

All interior glove box surfaces and pass-through door surfaces shall have a powder-coated, baked-on epoxy finish.  Hinging and latching components will be plastic- or epoxy-coated where practical.
All glovebox chambers will be designed to operate continuously at a negative 0.5” water column pressure for maximum personnel and product protection.  The pressure will be continuously monitored and an audible alarm sounds if the air pressure conditions deviate from pre-set criteria.  
Externally mounted fluorescent light assembly will illuminate the work surface and will be serviceable from outside the glovebox to maintain product and personnel protection during maintenance.
Eight inch diameter ABS glove ports with one piece sleeve and glove assembly built directly into the view screen for improved visibility and ergonomics.  
All interior and exterior glovebox doors will be tested to Class II Biological Safety Cabinet specifications using a 2” soap bubble test.  Gas-tight doors and view screens maintain air conditions internally.
Each chamber shall have a decontamination gas inlet and outlet port equipped with gas tight manually controlled ball valves.
All gloves shall be one-piece butyl, left, right, and ambidextrous types as defined by CDC.
All support stands shall be constructed from type 304 stainless steel.
Each chamber shall be provided with a junction box for electrical power connections.
Each cabinet control panel shall have a circuit breaker switch for its integral blower.
Each chamber shall have nitrogen inlet and outlet ports with inline HEPA filters and air tight manually operated ball valves.  Nitrogen flow rate to be specified by customer.  
All glovebox view screens will be constructed of 3/8” thick laminated safety glass 

f.	Exhaust Manifold:  (Not part of this quotation, to be supplied by others)

The exhaust manifolds shall be positioned in the interstitial space over each line and connect to each exhaust outlet.
Minimum ceiling height requirement is ten feet.
Flow rate shall be the sum of all the cabinets and the bypass flow for each line.
Manifold should be 6” high by 24” wide to keep maximum duct velocity below 2,000 feet per minute.
Manifold should be equipped with multi-function air bypass:
Canopy connection for glove box line
General room exhaust for lab ventilation requirements
Exhaust bypass during glovebox decontamination.
The manifold should be equipped with a pressure switch that will cut power to all glovebox blowers should the manifold pressure deviate above a predetermined value.
Bypass design should be coordinated with lab ventilation engineers.  The recommendation is to use a variable flow damper which maintains an exhaust manifold static pressure of -0.1” w.c.  

g.	Exhaust Manifold Matrix

Manifold Inlet Component Flow Rate(cfm)Flow Restrictions
                                       (inches water column)
2’ pass-thru	             50	               0
4’ glovebox	             350	       0
6’ glovebox	             450	       0
6’ class II, type B3	     550	       0.1
4’ glovebox	             350	       0
2’ pass-thru	              50	       0
Gx / decon bypass	     165-2	      tbd-3
Totals	                     1965-1	      0.1-4


Notes:

Total flow is based on preliminary HVAC design criteria of 840 cfm for class II and 1125 cfm for gloveboxes.
The Gx / decontamination bypass creates a canopy exhaust connection for the glove box line to the building exhaust.  It serves to decouple the glove box blowers from the building blower thus improving air flow balancing procedures.  In addition, the bypass grill can be designed to handle a greater flow rate while one or more glove boxes are sealed off for decontamination, thus maintaining laboratory airflow and pressure requirements.  
The restriction of the bypass will depend on the required bypass flow during decontamination.
The chambers and bypass are manifolded in parallel, thus the greatest restriction will dictate the manifold static pressure.  Each of the glove box chamber is equipped with integral exhaust blowers which handle their restrictions.  The class II cabinet with the canopy exhaust connection requires the manifold to be at approximately -0.1” w.c.  in order to pull air in through the canopy gap.  The manifold pressure may be determined by the bypass flow requirements.

h.	Other Requirements:

Per CDC requirements, all exposed metal within the gloveboxes shall be epoxy-coated.  All CDC cleaning agents should be carefully selected to avoid breakdown of the epoxy coating.
Class III gloveboxes are not required for this particular application.  These gloveboxes will not be designed or tested to meet the more stringent Class III requirements.
Operators Manual:  A complete operators manual includes factory acceptance test reports and lists of all replacement parts will be supplied.  The operators manual contains directions for all routine maintenance.
Kick off meeting: Prior to design and construction a factory engineer will meet with CDC end users and engineers in Atlanta for a one day final design meeting to address all outstanding concerns and issues associated with the custom made glovebox line.  Any additional factory engineer on-site visits requested by CDC will be at an additional cost.

2.	Installation

Because of the special nature of the two custom built glovebox lines, installation by factory service technicians is required.  The equipment will be received at the CDC loading dock by Government personnel, then moved into the laboratory and installed by the contractor.  A soap-bubble pressure test shall be run to insure integrity.

Any and all external facilities connections will be made by others (electrical, HVAC, gasses, etc.).

The Government will evaluate the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror’s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror’s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

<DESC>The Vehicle Systems Program (VSP) is the vehicle technology development function for the Aeronautics Technology Theme within NASA’s Aeronautics Enterprise.  VSP was created in fiscal year 2003 to combine seven projects developing air vehicle technologies into one comprehensive program.  In order to focus the technology development within each project, six conceptual vehicles are defined which reflect the various technologies being developed across the program.  The purpose of this contract is to construct sets of large and small models of the conceptual vehicles to aid in VSP outreach activities. The Contractor shall build and deliver 2 sets of large and 4 sets of small models of the VSP conceptual vehicles.  Sizes are defined below.  The Government will provide 3-views of the models in the JPEG image format.  The six conceptual vehicles are defined as: 	Subsonic Transport (ST) 	Supersonic Aircraft (SSA) 	Rotocraft (RC)	 	Extreme Short Takeoff and Landing (ESTOL) 	Personal Air Vehicle (PAV) 	Uninhabited Air Vehicle (UAV) Deliverables: Note on model sizes:  The following sizes are based on sizing the various models to one another not by scale but by relative size. This creates models in the same set at difference scales, but avoids creating models that are undesirably large or small. Large Models (2 sets required): ST  - 5' wing span, fuselage to scale SSA - 5' fuselage length, wing to scale RC - 4' fuselage length, wing to scale ESTOL - 4' fuselage length, wing to scale PAV - 3.5' fuselage length, wing to scale UAV - 5' wing span Small models (4 sets required): ST - 12" wing span, fuselage to scale SSA - 12" fuselage length, wing to scale RC - 10" fuselage length, wing to scale ESTOL - 10" fuselage length, wing to scale PAV - 9" fuselage length, wing to scale UAV - 12" wing span Stands: Each model shall be mounted on a statically stable stand sufficient to support the weight of the model.  The stand shall be designed in a manner to not distract from the model’s appearance.  It is preferable to have the large stands created in a manner that allows for displaying from the floor or a standard height table. Finish: The models shall be finished with paint and decals to achieve a look typical of that reflected in the images.  No detail on the interior of vehicles is expected.  No landing gear is required.  All vehicles shall follow the same exterior scheme, which will be selected by time of contract award. Shipping Containers: Each large model shall be delivered with its own shipping crate.  A set of small models may be contained within one shipping crate.  The crates shall be of a material sufficient to prevent damage to the models during standard shipping on commercial carriers. The period of performance shall be 3 months from date of award. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 01 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR NANOLAMINATE MULTI-LAYER SPUTTER DEPOSITION RETROFIT.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions that were received. Question # 1:  Will the company providing the equipment be performing the installation, verify that it meets spec, train operators? Answer # 1:  NASA employees and on site contractor technicians will install this equipment. The offeror should be willing to advise NASA employees via phone regarding installation questions and operational questions.  We are experienced with vacuum hardware, power supplies and sources.  We have limited experience with sputtering and with motion control programming, but can get local assistance in these areas. NASA intends to verify compliance with the specification. Vendors should propose equipment that has a high probability of meeting our uniformity spec based upon modeling and measurements of their sources in comparable systems.  NASA has metrology equipment (Taylor Hobson NanoStep II or Atomic Force Microscope) capable of performing accurate film thickness measurements. Question # 2:  Will the system be on site for install? Answer # 2:  The BAK-760 system must remain at MSFC at all times. Question # 3:  In order to guarantee a film thickness, it would be much easier to provide a new system with new parts that has been proven to reach uniformity &lt;2%. It is much more difficult to install equipment in a huge chamber (sputtering distance only needs to be 4 inches) and work around existing equipment).  Can we quote a new system as an "alternative". We can be price competitive and can demonstrate that the new equipment can be upgraded to the future set up. Answer # 3:  New systems can be quoted; however, we expect that our overall cost will be high compared with the retrofit and may exceed our budget limit.  We must also consider the cost to install new utility feeds (power and water) and lab space. Our spec did not cover issues that would arise with a new system such as pump type, size, etc. In addition, NASA’s long term interest in NanoLaminates requires that they be manufacturable as very large structures (one to three meters in size or larger).  We hope to transfer this technology to an existing 18-foot diameter chamber in the future. If a unique chamber is required to achieve good results, we have little hope of expanding this technology. Question # 4:  Can the planetary on the Balzer's system be removed? Or does it remain? Answer # 4: In general, no. We want to leave the planetary in place as the chamber will alternate usage between an evaporative system and a sputter system on a week-to-week basis. If rapid changeover is possible, approximately one hour duration, then removing the planetary plate only is possible.  We will not remove the rotation drive, optical monitor and film thickness monitor. The current plate has #10-32 holes spaced on a 1" grid pattern concentric with the center of rotation and may be able to support NanoLaminate hardware. Question # 5:  Thickness uniformity can easily be achieved using a rotating substrate and a confocal set up.  A fixed substrate that is rotated in front of a source that is direct is questionable that it can reach &lt;5% uniformity. Answer # 5:  Rotation of the substrate is allowable and is probably preferred.	We still need to alternate materials on a layer by layer basis.	By confocal, we hope that you mean that the three sources are tilted and aimed at a common point allowing the substrate to be coated by all three sources on an alternating basis without indexing. Question # 6:  ****** Answer # 6:  ****** Question # 7:  Our magetron sources do meet spec. Answer # 7:  The specification was intended to allow competition. Question # 8:  Is the sample heated? Answer # 8:  Definitely not. Question # 9:  Is the sample cooled? Answer # 9:  We were not planning to cool the sample.  NanoLaminate layers are very thin and we hope to operate at low power levels.  Excessive heating will cause our substrates, typically fused silica, to change figure; this could be a problem. Your advice is welcome. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.

 The data is recorded to a 6MB data logger card that may be downloaded, read and printed at any time. Will the particle counter be in a stand alone location or will it be connected to the computer via 232 serial port with a printer connected as well?

Answer:
The monitor shall be standalone (i.e., shall include a built in printer) and shall also provide an RS232 connection to a computer.  This means that there shall be two modes of operation, in one of which the results are printed immediately with no remote operation and another with the monitor under remote control of a computer and sending data to it.  The software and cabling for this second mode must also be included.

<DESC>Solicitation No. T0436SOL0035; Amendment No. 2 

The following questions were raised during the Comprehensive Facilities Master Planning Support pre-submission meeting and tour at the National Zoological Park, July 13, 2004, and answers are provided for clarification.

Please Note:  Although it was announced at the pre-submission meeting that the Zoo plans to issue multiple awards, multiple awards will not be made.  A single contract will be awarded.  

There were several questions at the meeting regarding multiple awards.  Because a single contract will be awarded, these questions are not included below.

(1)  Q:  When will interviews with short-listed firms be held?  A:  The Smithsonian anticipates that interviews will be held in the fall, probably sometime in September.

(2)  Q:  How many firms will be placed on the short list?  A:  The short list will probably include 4-6 firms.

(3)   Q:  How will the new director arriving at the end of the year interface with this project?  A:  It is difficult to predict what effect the new director's arrival will have.  The Smithsonian leadership is fully supportive of the direction the Zoo is going and will be making the selection for the new director.  Obviously, he or she will be involved in the master planning process.
   
(4)  Q:  Will the public be involved?  A:  New procedure and regulations in the historic preservation process make provision for public consultation. Public involvement is also integrated in the NEPA process and the NCPC and CFA review processes.  Regardless of requirements, the Smithsonian anticipates conducting neighborhood outreach meetings in which we invite public comment on this master planning project.

(5)  Q:  Who is on the selection committee?  A:  The team is still being established, but it will be chaired by the Director of the Smithsonian Engineering and Design Division and include professional architects, engineers, and Zoo staff.

(6)  Q:  When do we expect work to begin?  A:  We anticipate the contract to be awarded around the first of the year.

(7) Q:  Can the attendance list be made available?  A:  Yes.  If you would like to request a copy of the attendance list, please do so via fax or e-mail to the attention of Susan Engelhardt, Office of Contracting, at engelhardts@si.edu or fax number 202-275-0624.  

(8)  Q:  Is the Zoo asking that firms directly address the six questions listed in the FBO announcement?  A:  We expect these questions to be addressed.  It is up to the submitting firm to decide whether or not to address each question directly.

(9)  Q:  Can firms submit information in addition to what is provided in the Form 330?  A:  Yes, but please limit any additional information to no more than 20 pages.

(10)  Q:  Will the evaluation team be involved in the decision-making process throughout the project?  A:  Yes.

(11)  Q:  Is there any special requirement for small businesses?  A:  Depending on the dollar amount of a particular work order, large businesses may be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.

(12)  Q:  Where can I get a copy of the form 330?  A:  Go to the Forms Library at http://www.gsa.gov.

(13)  Q:  What is the size of the park that is developed?  A:  Approximately 70 acres of the 163 acres is devoted to public exhibits.

(14)  Q.  Are Asia Trail, Phase I and II givens for the Master Planning process?  A.  Yes.

(15)  Q:  Will the trees be considered in the planning process?  A:  Yes. Trees identified as “Heritage Trees” will be preserved and protected during the design and construction process.  A tree survey update will be required as part of the Master Plan.

(16)  Q:  Will security be included in the Master Plan?  A:  Yes. We will provide the successful firm with the Smithsonian standards for security of collections and property.

(17)  Q:  How many points of access are there to the park?  A:  There are eight gates to the park.  This number includes four public entrances [i.e., separate walk in and drive in gates on Connecticut Avenue, and walk in/drive in gates at the Harvard Street Bridge and Beach Drive (Rock Creek Park)], two public gates where the Rock Creek Park bike trail passes through the Zoo, and a staff entrance at Adam’s Mill Road.

(18)  Q:  Is there transportation available to visitors within the zoo?  A:  No, and the Master Plan should address this issue.

(19)  Q:  Is there parking within the Zoo?  A:  Yes.  There are five parking lots plus a bus drop-off area.

(20)  Q:  Are the buildings considered historic?  A:  Yes.  The National Zoo is registered in the National Register of Historic Places as a site and many of the older buildings are contributing structures.

(21)  Q:  Where are the Zoo services housed?  A:  Most of the facilities for services are housed in one building located under parking lot C, out of sight and sound of the public.

(22)  Q:  Does the Zoo have special events?  A:  Yes.  Numerous special events and fundraising activities are held throughout the year and are a very important part of the Zoo and will be an important factor in the Master Plan.

(23)  Q:  Why are vehicles on Olmsted Walk?  A:  In the original plan for the Zoo, Olmsted Walk was a public street and many of the exhibit buildings were oriented to be accessed from that street.  As a result, there are limited service access opportunities without driving directly on Olmsted Walk.  This is an element we are looking forward to improving through the Master Plan.

(24)  Q:  How does the public access the Bird House?  A:  The Bird House is one of the main exhibits not on Olmsted Walk (Amazonia and Beaver Valley are also not directly on Olmsted Walk) and, as a result, receives fewer visitations.  Historically, access to the Bird House was limited to three pathways leading through the Wetlands Exhibit, the Flight Cage, and the former Hardy Hoof area.  Currently, due to the Phase I construction of Asia Trail, access is restricted to the service road from the top of Beaver Valley.  With the completion of Asia Trail, there will be direct ADA accessible route to the Bird House for the first time, and planned renovation of the Wetland Exhibit will increase access.

(25)  Q:  Will LEEDS certification be considered in the Master Plan?  A:  We will not require LEEDS certification; however, a core value of the organization outlined in the Strategic Plan is conservation, and that includes meeting sustainable goals responsibly.

(26)  Q:  Will a zoo design firm be required to lead the team?  A:  No.  The team, however, will require strong zoo design experience.

(27)  Q:  What is the O-Line?  A:  The O-Line is a structure that allows orang utans to exhibit their natural locomotion abilities to travel between the Ape House and Think Tank.

(28)  Q:  Why are there sculptures in the park?  A:  Art has been a part of the National Zoo since the Work Projects Administration (WPA) of the 1930’s.  Animal sculpture and artifacts continue to be popular.

(29)  Q:  Are the old master plans available?  A:  Former master plans are available for review in the Zoo library, or can be purchased if desired.

(30)  Q:  Is there a scale map of the entire Zoo property available?  A:  An AutoCad drawing can be provided in WinZip format via E-mail if requested. Requests should be submitted to Susan Engelhardt, Office of Contracting, at the e-mail or fax number stated above.

(31)  Q:  Is interpretation a required skill?  A:  Interpretation specifically is not required; however the team certainly needs to have a high level of understanding of how to create a learning environment for our visitors, since this is a key part of the mission of the Zoo.

(32)  Q:  Is there any preference whether a lead firm is an architect or engineer?  A:  There is no requirement of professional specialty for a lead firm.

NOTE:  If this document is too difficult to read as posted, you may request a copy of the document via fax or e-mail to Susan Engelhardt at the address/fax number stated above.
