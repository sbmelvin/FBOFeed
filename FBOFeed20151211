<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
<p>AFRL/RITA requires a purchase of one (1) Photon Detection System, (Cryospot with Freeze4 Sorption PN: CDS41B-VAC-8CH-1550). Specifications as follows:</p>
<p>Tungsten -Silicon (WSi) Single-Element Nanowire Detector &amp; Electronics</p>
<p>&bull; Nanowire detector fiber-coupled to SMF28 fiber (9um core)<br />&bull; System Detection Efficiency @ 1550nm, max. polarization: 90 &plusmn; 5%<br />&bull; Recovery time (to return to full SDE): &lt;100ns<br />&bull; Dark counts @ max SDE: &lt;1kcps<br />&bull; Jitter, FWHM: &lt;100 ps<br />&bull; Detector biasing electronics<br />&bull; Room temperature low noise amplifiers<br />&bull; LVTTL output option</p>
<p>1 year warranty against defects in parts and workmanship</p>
<p>On-site installation and training</p>
<p>The following add on items will also be provided:</p>
<p>Closed-cycle GM cryo cooler (RDK101D)</p>
<p>&bull; Freeze4 4He sorption fridge with base temp ~ 0.8K, no-load hold time: 48h (typ. 60h)<br />&bull; 6" OD Cryostat with 8x KF40 ports (one in use for control wiring)<br />&bull; Temperature controllers<br />&bull; 8x RF (SMA) inputs (4 per KF40 port)<br />&bull; Lossless optical feed through for 8x SMF28 fiber with FC/PC input ports (4 per KF40)<br />&bull; Freeze Control software for sorption fridge control and one-click cool down, cycling, scheduling cycles, graphical monitoring, temperature logging<br />&bull; Cryostat with stand overall dim. (approx): 10" x 11" x 26"<br />&bull; Compressor dimensions (approx): 15.3" x 17.7" x 15.7"</p>
<p>Vacuum and remote control package</p>
<p>&bull; Oil-free roughing/turbo pumping station &amp; vacuum gauge<br />&bull; Sharp positive or negative pulse output (+/- ~300mV pulse height).<br />&bull; Relay control to operate cryocooler remotely<br />&bull; Integrated operation via Freeze Control software<br />1 year warranty against defects in parts and workmanship</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Photon Spot Inc., 142 W Olive Ave, Monrovia CA 91016, USA.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this state of the art requirement as Photon Spot, Inc. is the only source that offers the highest system detection efficiency of any superconducting nanowire detector in a turnkey closed cycle system that can meet all necessary elements to work with the Governments application. The Governments application requires extremely high system detection efficiency of the detectors, with a high saturated count rate of photons, low dark count rate, very fast reset time and low timing jitter. Typical photon-detectors suffer from high dark count rates, slow reset time, low system detection efficiency and low saturated photon count rates. The detectors from Photon Spot can meet all of these requirements.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before <br />8 January 2016.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<CONTACT>Dale R. Reckley, Contracting Officer, Phone 406-329-3525, Email dreckley@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Riley Pass Uranium Mine Site (Site) is located in North Cave Hills of the Custer Gallatin National Forest in Harding County, South Dakota. Bluffs F, G and I are located in Township 22 North, Range 5 East, Sections 35 and 36, Black Hills Meridian. The Site is approximately 100 miles north of Belle Fourche, South Dakota, 25 miles north of Buffalo, South Dakota and 30 miles south of Bowman, North Dakota. The nearest town is Ludlow, South Dakota which is approximately 5 miles to the east of the Site. The Site can be accessed by turning west off US Highway 85 onto the Tufte Road, 2 miles north of Ludlow; then turning left on the South Cave (Riley Pass) Road which turns into Forest Service Road (FSR) #3120 at the National Forest boundary. The main access roads to the Site are FSR #3120 and #3130 and also the Welch Fire Trail road just south of Ludlow. A portion of FSR #3130 is closed to public travel.<br />The work under this contract will consist of the excavation of contaminated waste from bluff areas, the placement of excavated wastes into the Bluff I Repository, and the regrading of the repository and spoils material left in place on the sides of the bluffs. Regrading of the spoils will require the use of equipment suited for working on steep slopes. All equipment used for regrading and finishing to final grade must be equipped with GPS receivers configured to work with digital electronic (AutoCAD) files and is a requirement of this contract. The finished grade of the regraded spoils and repository top contains complex topography. The Contractor should be aware of this and should anticipate additional time over that required for more normal regrading and finish grading.<br />All disturbed areas will be covered with a cover system consisting of soil from an on-site borrow source supplemented with compost, fertilized and seeded. The depth of cover soil on the Bluff I repository will be a minimum of 18 inches, while the depth of cover on the remainder of the disturbed areas will be 12 inches. Work also includes development of the on-site borrow source and upon project completion, reclamation of the borrow area which will consist of spreading salvaged topsoil, seeding, fertilizing, placement of erosion control mat and fencing. <br />Weather permitting, a pre-bid tour is scheduled for January 12, 2016 at 10:00 am Mountain Standard Time. Interested contractors shall meet at the Ludlow Community Center on the east side of US Highway 85 behind the Ludlow School. Contractors must sign up to attend the pre-bid tour by sending an email to the contracting officer. If weather does not allow an on-site visit, the tour will be cancelled a minimum of 3 days in advance by posting an announcement on the Federal Business Opportunities website.<br />

<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Architecture Concept Study: <p> NASA invites industry to participate in the definition and analysis of the Nations future space communications and navigation architecture with a focus on the Earth and Mars space relay capabilities. This future system capability will provide the next generation space and ground infrastructure to enhance space exploration and return critical science and exploration data to investigators on Earth from all regions of the solar system. The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Office at NASA leads the architecture study and manages and operates NASAs critical communications and navigation system infrastructure. <p> This study will define a top-level end-to-end next generation (Next Gen) architecture concept that evolves NASAs space communications and navigation networks consisting of NASA, commercial industry, other government agencies, and international space agencies assets and other supporting systems. Next Gen is broadly defined over the next 25 years to the 2040 timeframe and more specifically defined over the next 10 years to the 2025 time frame when initial Next Gen capabilities will start to become operational. <p> NASA offers a range of world class space communications and navigation services and capabilities to enable the next generation of science and exploration missions and global collaborations.  These services and capabilities (e.g. forward and return communications, tracking, navigation aids, internetworking, and timing references) allow missions to share the costs of critical, space and ground infrastructure and eliminate individual and costly mission-specific facilities thus providing a cost effective, national resource for space exploration. <p> In the coming decade, NASA will look to sustain and enhance its space and ground infrastructure to adjust and respond to the changing needs of science missions and plans for future human exploration of the solar system.  The Next Gen relay architecture study will provide a detailed analysis of capability proposed for the future network.  A four-month study is envisioned to: 	apply the needs of NASAs mission use cases against proposed elements of the future architecture; 	conduct simulations and trades for the proposed implementation of architecture features; 	define specific relay, tracking, and internetworking capabilities for near Earth (up to 2 million kilometers) and/or Mars spacecraft; and 	provide cost estimates of developing, deploying, operating, maintaining and sustaining the proposed new space relay capabilities over a 20 year window. <p> The vision for the future network will connect investigators more closely with their scientific instrumentation, reduce both user mission spacecraft and infrastructure burden (resources and cost), apply appropriate aspects of terrestrial communication technologies, enable greater availability and leverage commercial innovations and capabilities and international partnerships. <p> The study consists of four tasks: 	Develop the architecture for  future relay capabilities in the Near Earth and/or deep space regions 	Conduct trade studies, modeling and simulation, analysis of future relay capabilities and identify enabling technologies 	Define and infuse specific near Earth and/or Mars relay elements and their capabilities 	Develop cost and schedule estimates for future near Earth and/or Mars relay elements <p> During the course of the study, it will be important to provide a basis for proposed new capabilities via properly analyzed trades, analyses and operational scenarios.	The study effort will emphasize the trades and analyses conducted and will be used as justification and supporting rationale for the proposed architecture elements for the entire set of SCaN networks focusing on near Earth and Mars relays elements. Models and simulations developed during this study may be used to explore specific relay elements or capabilities in more detail during follow-on design and implementation efforts. Offerors will be asked to consider best commercial practices and standards, emerging technologies, and compare the current and anticipated capabilities and technologies available to implement each architecture feature below within the near Earth and Mars network architecture. Recommendations will be based upon simulation results or through trade studies with proper rationale. <p> The study will focus on trades associated with the following architecture features: <p> Relay Capability  integrated functionality relay satellites or disaggregated functionality across a collection of dissimilar satellites providing communications, navigation, and internetworking capabilities <p> Direct to Ground  where/when direct to ground services have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage over relays <p> Spacecraft burden  shared burden (e.g. mass, power, volume, operational complexity) between relay infrastructure and mission spacecraft to increase performance and reduce overall cost <p> Multiple Access  where/when multiple access techniques (e.g. TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, OFDMA, spatial diversity, others) should be used on forward/return links from/to relays in order to simultaneously support the needs of multiple mission spacecraft within the full field of regard <p> Optical Communications  where/when optical links have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage <p> RF Communications  where/when RF links have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage <p> Government ownership and operations  requirements and mission aspects requiring NASA owned or operated assets <p> Commercial Service and operations  mission/infrastructure aspects potentially met by commercial services <p> Internetworking  benefits and burden of providing link layer (2) and network layer (3) services <p> Security  role, approach, benefits, and risks of secure command, telemetry, and science data links <p> Timing and Frequency Standards  common time standards, radiometrics and other navigation aids <p> User Service Requests  means and capacity to support automated requests for communication and navigation services on-demand as well as near term scheduled service <p> Autonomy  where/when in the network autonomy has technical, operational, and/or cost advantage <p> Cognition  adaptive or cognitive communications and networking to improve efficiency <p> Commonality  across elements of near Earth and Mars relays that reduce development or operations costs <p> Deployment of Relay Elements  Launch methods (e.g. primary payload, secondary/ride share, hosted payloads), launch vehicle configuration, number of launches, and cost <p> The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about January 14, 2016 with an anticipated proposal due date on or about February 15, 2016. <p> It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). <p> Please send questions regarding the Synopsis or the Industry Briefing to: <a href="mailto:SCaN-NextGen-Architecture@lists.nasa.gov">SCaN-NextGen-Architecture@lists.na sa.gov </a> <p> INDUSTRY BRIEFING Interested parties are invited to attend an industry briefing at NASA Headquarters Auditorium January 21, 2016, at 300 East Street SW, Room 1G60, Washington DC, 20546.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).

The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to award delivery orders under Basic Ordering Agreement Number N00024-12-G-4329, on an other than full and open competition basis, to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Post-Interim support for the LCS 1 and LCS 3.
 Efforts will include execution and advance planning of Continuous Maintenance Availabilities (CMAV), Continuous Maintenance (CM), Emergent Maintenance (EM), Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Planning and Execution, Facilities Maintenance (FM), Administration and Engineering Support Services (AESS), and class planning and support services. These delivery orders will bridge the gap between interim support services, currently being performed under contracts N00024-03-C-2311 and N00024-09-C-2303, and the competitive award of a Product Support Plan (PSP) contract.  As the shipbuilder of the LCS 1 variant, LM MS2 is the only known source with extensive previous experience necessary to perform these efforts and has developed unique and technical expertise for the design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of these ships.
  LM MS2 is the only known source capable of providing coverage in order to prevent possible disruption in services and unacceptable delays in mission critical efforts necessary to restore or maintain the ship to a fully operational level required to support the Fleet.

The statutory authority for the sole source is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<p>Anticipated Issue Date: 08 JAN 16 - Closing Date: 22 FEB 16</p>
<p><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division plans to enter into a five year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.P. dba L-3 TCS (Cage Code 0F5W6) located in Warner Robins, Georgia. The unpriced BOA will have a ceiling of $12,500,000. The Statement of Work within the BOA will cover Logistics and Configuration Management, Engineering Support, Provisioned Item Order (PIOs) spares, Hardware, Related Technical Services, and Data to support the Precision Strike Package(PSP) for AC-130J/W. PSP equipment includes sensors, displays, mission control hardware, communication equipment, weapon and weapon control systems and related avionics.</p>
<p>Supplies/Services includes support of integration of equipment on new and existing platforms, test (flight and ground) operations of new and existing aircraft installed equipment, and engineering assistance to Combat Acquisition Detachments at Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field AFB and Cannon AFB.</p>
<p>Logistics support will include maintain configuration control on delivered products, design and build PSP components and systems to support new integrations and employments, conduct analysis and test to obtain and retain System Safety and airworthiness certifications of new and existing installed PSP hardware and support equipment. Services will also include drafting and providing documentation for the flight release and AC-130 Configuration Control Board (CCB). Other documentation requirements may include drafting and delivery of complete technical orders and service bulletins for PSP and related equipment.</p>
<p>The BOA will be placed in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.". The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The solicitation will include DFARS clause 252.225-7001.</p>
<p>This synopsis is issued to advertise the five year BOA and requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a one year period.</p>
<p>The request for proposal will not be made available through http://www.fbo.gov. The solicitation will be provided to the sole source contractor through electronic mail. The proposed noncompetitive contract action is anticipated to be an acquisition of non-commercial supplies/services.</p>
<p>Responsible sources may submit capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed BOA based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact L-3 TCS directly.</p>

evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which
forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous
submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a
source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or
approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to

<CONTACT>Bell, Ron
<DESC>Response Date: December 15, 2015 

In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development,  intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Varidesk LLC 117 Wrangler Dr. Ste. 100., Coppell, Tx. 7509 to purchase the following products: Varidesk Pro Plus 36

(Standing Desk)/Quantity: 6
Varidesk Laptop 30 (Standing Desk)/Quantity: 1
Varidesk Cube Plus 48 (Standing Desk)/Quantity: 1
Varidesk The Mat 34 (High-density Core Mat)/Quantity: 1
Varidesk The Mat 36 (High-density Core Mat)/Quantity: 7

After extensive market research it has been determined that the only products that meet the EPAÂ¿s requirements are these specific products and are only available through Varidesk. The adjustable pop-up desk must fit on the top surface of employee desks. All employee computer workstation equipment must fit on the desk and allow the employee to work in a standing or sitting position. The pop-up desk unit must be able to be easily moved in the event of internal personnel moves within the building.
Specifically, the sit-to-stand adjustable pop-up desk must adjust to several different heights and also must include: 
Â¿	Either a keyboard deck lift with the display surface or a large enough display surface to accommodate a keyboard; 
Â¿	A work surface size of at least: 30Â¿x30Â¿ (keyboard tray and desk);
Â¿	A 35 pound minimum weight capacity; 
Â¿	The ability to switch from a sitting to a standing position in seconds;
Â¿	An ergonomic design that adjusts to most userÂ¿s height Â¿ with a springÂ¿assisted lift to make it easy for all employees to use; 
Â¿	And, fully assembled/easy set-up.
These features, which can only be obtained with the Varidesk Pro Plus, Cube Plus, and Laptop  models listed above, are required to support both planned and unanticipated personnel moves. Market research was conducted to determine the availability and features of the pop-up desk in the market. The market research was focused on finding an adjustable desk riser that can stand independently on the userÂ¿s desktop, one that is not a separate desk or table, and one that comes without an attaching clamp. The pop-up desk must have the capability of supporting oneÂ¿s monitor and/or decking stations at one time. The only products to meet or exceed these requirements are the Varidesk Pro and Pro Plus models. The varying sizes (30/36/48) are needed to fit differences in desk/office configurations.

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUO TE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within  four  (4) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Ron Bell via the e-mail link below.  Award will be made to the vendor who demonstrates the are technically capable with the lowest price. NO phone calls please.

<p>Construction Project:<br />OVERVIEW: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires replacement of the fire protection system in the powerhouse oil storage room at Libby Dam, Montana. Project work area access is restricted by the adjacency of the Powerhouse to the Kootenai River and the dam, and restrictions on the use of cranes, lifts and other equipment in the proximity of energized overhead transmission lines, transformers and transformer bus lines.

<p>DEMOLITION/DECONSTRUCTION: Removal of the existing CO2 system in the oil purification room and oil storage room at Libby Dam, and provision of temporary suitable manual fire protection until the water mist system is operable and accepted.

The firing heads on the CO2 bottles, however, shall remain the property of the Government.</p>
<p>FIRE PROTECTION INSTALLATION: Detailed design, provision, and installation of a fine water mist fire protection system for the oil purification room and oil storage room at Libby Dam. The oil purification room and oil storage room together shall be considered one zone; if water mist is triggered in either room, it is triggered in both rooms.</p>
<p>ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION: Detailed design, provision, and installation of electrical system needed to meet the requirements of the fire suppression system being provided.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE. Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB TN intends to award a sole source contract to Siemens AG, for Type 8DA10 medium-voltage gas-insulated switchgear. No solicitation package will be issued. However, all interested sources may identify their interest but must provide proof of capability to provide an acceptable product by submitting pricing data, an accurate description of the equipment offered and make and model numbers of the equipment. Only responses containing this data will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will not be made on the basis of responses received to this synopsis. If no favorable responses are received by <strong>2:00 PM CST on&nbsp;11 January 2016</strong>, a contract will be negotiated with the above named source.
<p>AEDC has the need to procure medium voltage switchgear that is reliable and safe. Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is the latest technology that provides power without requiring personnel be equipped with arc flash personal protective equipment (PPE) while operating or maintaining the GIS equipment. Hours of industry wide research, competitive bidding, and accepted maintenance and reliability practice have resulted in the conclusion that Siemens Type 8DA10 Gas Insulated Switchgear is the only switchgear that confines each of the three phases of power in three separate compartments. This is a critical requirement from a safety standpoint and mitigates electrical fault severity to avoid costly shutdowns of the entire system. Competitors' designs have all three phases in a single compartment. With the isolation of the phases a factory-trained Siemens employee can remove the damaged phase and replace it with the identical part from a spare cubicle, and return the cubicle to service in a short amount of time. In most cases this work can be completed with the remainder of the switchgear lineup still in service. In these situations, all competitors' GIS, in most cases, require that the entire switchgear lineup to be de-energized while the entire enclosure is removed (all three phases) and sent to the factory for repair. If spares are available, a new enclosure could be installed from the spare cubicle but the entire lineup would be unavailable throughout the duration of the repair. The competitors also have sections of conductors that are not housed in gas compartments and if the failure occurs at these points in the circuit it could result in much more severe damage.</p>

<DESC>Partnership Opportunity Document (POD)for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) PIXIE Cryo-cooler System <p> General Information 	 1.0 Introduction and Scope <p> This proposal opportunity is for a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for an Explorers Mission expected to be released in September 2016. The draft AO is expected in the Spring/early Summer of 2016. NASA GSFC is seeking a partner to develop the 4-10 Kelvin (K) cryo-cooler system for a potential mission concept proposal, the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). The potential GSFC Explorer mission concept is designed to meet the science goals of the Explorer Program, as currently understood.  GSFC mission teams will be submitting proposals to the Explorers AO expected to be a two-step process, with the first proposal response being primarily focused on the merit and feasibility of the science objectives of the proposed mission, however, with convincing information on technology readiness, implementable design that is traceable to science requirements, programmatic cost and schedule risk. The initial submissions will then be down-selected, and the resultant subset of proposals will be funded to perform Phase A mission concept studies. During Phase A (Step 2), proposals will be expanded and refined to detail the entire end-to-end mission life cycle concept, with greater attention to engineering implementation, technology risk, programmatic, cost and schedule risk. While the AO schedule cannot be specified at this time, the following is estimated based on earlier AOs and related missions: <p> AO release:  September 2016 (target) Proposals due:	December 2016 (target) Phase A selection:  June/July 2017 (target) Phase A concept study report due:  June 2018 (target) Mission selection:  January 2019 (target) Launch readiness date: NLT November 2024	 		 This partnership opportunity is being issued to select a teaming partner to help prepare the GSFC Explorer candidate mission concept for the initial Step 1 proposal submittal; to assist in the Phase A mission concept study report and Site Visit if the mission is down-selected; and to provide a flight qualified cryo-cooler system within the allocated schedule and budget should the mission be selected for flight. <p> There will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners for the AO proposal cycle. If the proposed mission is selected for a Phase A Concept Study, limited funding will be available according to the budget developed during proposal preparation. If the proposed mission is selected for flight, partner(s) will be funded according to the budget developed during the AO proposal phase. <p> 2.0 Subsystem Overview <p> Cost is an important issue for the mission designs. The likely PI-managed mission cost cap for the Explorer AO will be $225M in FY17$. This cost includes the instrument, spacecraft, management, safety & mission assurance, integration & testing, instrument to spacecraft integration support, integration support for the spacecraft to launch vehicle, and spacecraft operations, as well as required contingency (25% or greater reserves on Phases A-D). This cost does not include launch services. Reserves will be held at the Project level, and not with the partner. <p> GSFC is interested in finding a partner to develop a flight-qualified 4-10 K cryo-cooler system. No other subsystems are part of this POD. <p> Proprietary detailed information on the cryo-cooler system specification will be provided to those responding with a Notice of Interest. A Notice of Interest (it is intentionally not called a notice of intent) does not obligate an organization to provide a POD response, however, by responding with a Notice of Interest, the receiver of the proprietary detailed specifications on the cryo-cooler are bound by non-disclosure agreements of proprietary information and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions as stated and labeled in the follow-up documents. <p> 3.0 Pre-selection Support <p> 3.1 Initial Proposal Support <p> SOW: It is expected that the selected respondent will provide support using their own resources to help develop and write the Mission proposal in response to the AO in the area of the cryo-cooler system (TBD pages as specified in the AO). This will involve meeting with the scientists and the overall mission engineering team: To help define the end-to-end performance and interface requirements; to define the flight system architecture; to identify study topics; and to predict performance. This will include cost estimation for all mission phases. Note: The cost differentiation between the Step 1 proposal and the Step 2 Phase A proposal can not be exceeded by 10%. The period of performance of the Step 1 proposal for this interval is expected to last 5--7 months, starting approximately April/May of 2016 and lasting until the Step 1 proposal is submitted, currently anticipated to be December 2016. <p> 3.2 Phase A Study and Phase A Proposal Support <p> SOW: If the mission is selected for a Phase A study, the proposal team will receive $TBD (total Phase A funding level will be identified in the AO) to conduct a Phase A study and submit a detailed concept study report and hold a Site Visit. The respondent, providing the cryo-cooler system for the mission, will be allocated a portion of this total budget to perform trade studies as identified in the initial proposal. The respondent will also be expected to contribute to designing, documenting, and costing the cryo-cooler system design, fabrication, integration and testing for inclusion in the final Explorer mission concept study report (as specified in the AO) and provide support to the Site Visit. The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 11 to 16 months, starting approximately summer of 2017. <p> 3.3 POD Response Instructions for Pre-Selection Support <p> The respondent shall: <p> 1) Demonstrate understanding and experience in the design, fabrication, integration and testing of the cryo-cooler system under consideration: <p> Identify the means of addressing system requirements your team assumes are likely to exist and tasks the system is intended for, <p> Highlight particularly critical or challenging areas for the design of the cryo-cooler system, <p> Provide a technical summary/description of the proposed hardware including relevant heritage (mission names and instrument names, launch dates, successful performance, etc.) and information regarding the respondents on-time schedule and cost delivery of stated system(s) on previous space flight missions and/or missions currently in development <p> Provide information on how much of the cryo-cooler system for this mission concept needs to change relative to previously provided/delivered cryo-cooler systems by the respondent. <p> Provide information on the TRL of the anticipated cryo-cooler required for proposing with this mission concept proposal. <p> 2) Identify any recommended trades related to the cryo-cooler system. <p> 3) Indicate the level of resources to be allocated for the proposal phase. <p> Discuss skills that will be provided, availability of required engineering support, past experience of engineering and oversight support, and the appropriate level of conceptual design, and all important analyses and trade studies. <p> 4) Identify the pertinent missions for which they have previously provided support for proposal writing in the area of cryo-cooler system design, fabrication, integration and testing: <p> Provide data on scope of the cryo-cooler system design, the role that they played in the proposal process, and the portions of the proposal they have written or provided assistance in writing. Provide a customer reference POC. <p> Describe how this proposal role mapped to their role in the end cryo-cooler system development. If the scope changed, explain why. <p> 4.0 Development Support <p> SOW: At the end of Phase A another down-select occurs. If the mission is selected for development and launch, the respondent will be responsible for the design, development, fabrication, test and delivery of the cryo-cooler system. The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 57 months, starting early 2019. This date may change depending upon selection timelines and budget allocations. <p> POD Response Instructions for Development Support <p> The respondent shall: <p> 1) Identify available design and modeling capabilities required to support development of the cryo-cooler system. Describe the level of experience with similar cryo-cooler system for all important personnel. <p> 2) Identify fabrication and testing facilities that will be required to support development and test of the cryo-cooler system. <p> 3) Identify which missions they have successfully supported in this capacity and provide a customer reference POC. <p> Provide information on recent similar cryo-cooler system designed and delivered, and describe how that experience is applicable to this mission. This shall include basic information on scope of work, how well the fielded cryo-cooler system met the cost and technical requirements, and how well the fielded cryo-cooler system met the proposed schedules. <p> 4) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline for the scope of the design, fabrication, and testing of the cryo-cooler system. The ROM will not be considered a binding commitment, but will serve as a consideration during the partnership evaluation. In consideration of the rigid cost cap for Explorer missions, the cost range for the cryo-cooler system will be an important consideration. The respondent is invited to comment on the reasonableness of the ROM cost estimate. <p> 5) The missions will be very cost sensitive. List ideas and methods of keeping costs low and the risk of cost growth low, including how you, the respondent, would utilize existing open market hardware to minimize costs and provide a more robust system. <p> 5.0 Additional Information <p> For pre-selection or development support, the respondent can provide any additional information on any other pertinent missions for which his/her establishment, and any partners/vendors proposed, have provided cryo-cooler systems, and identify the relevant details of similar systems. The respondent may also identify any other ideas and related activities, which your organization is or has been involved with, and the significance of that activity to this mission. <p> 6.0 General Instructions for POD Response <p> Potential respondents are asked to contact the GSFC Explorer team by 5 PM EST on January 11, 2016 with a Notice Of Interest (intentionally not called a notice of intent). This Notice of Interest does not create an obligation to respond to the POD, but allows the GSFC Explorer team to disseminate additional details on the mission parameters and to provide answers to questions from potential partners. All Notice of Interest respondents will receive a document containing additional details on the specification of the cryo-cooler system, which can be used to facilitate a focused response to the partnership opportunity.

<DESC><p>1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>President Obama created the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) in February 2012 to "strengthen our capacity to monitor and enforce U.S. trade rights and domestic trade laws, and thereby enhance market access for U.S. exporters." ITEC brings together experts from executive departments and agencies to coordinate enforcement of U.S. rights under international trade agreements. The International Trade Administration (ITA) participates in ITEC by providing staff and funding for translation services.</p>
<p>ITEC currently uses the State Department and the National Virtual Translation Center as its main sources for its translation services. Demand for translation services has grown since ITEC was founded. Coupled with increased need for this service are greater time constraints and an enhanced potential for service delays and deadline issues. The objective is to establish a source for translation services that will alleviate backlogging concerns.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION/:</p>
<p>ITEC requires translation services for various written material ranging from general textural documents such as news articles to complex legal documents such as laws, regulations, and legal briefs. Translation may be conducted in one of several directions (from foreign to English, from English to foreign, or from one foreign language to another foreign language). The service is amenable to addressing the more basic translation needs to highly technical requirements. The end product shall be a highly accurate and legally binding full translation. The Contractor shall deliver an electronic file (Microsoft Word) to ITEC.</p>
<p><br />Foreign languages will include languages listed below:</p>
<p>Arabic <br />German<br />Lithuanian</p>
<p>Armenian<br />Greek<br />Bahasa Malay</p>
<p>Bengali<br />Hebrew<br />Mongolian</p>
<p>Bosnian<br />Hindi<br />Montenegrin</p>

<p><br />The following is an overview of requirements for language service fulfillment:</p>
<p>&bull; Quality assurance: Translation of highly complex material must have the highest level of accuracy because it has the potential to be used in legal proceedings. Translations should flow properly in the target language and accurately convey the meaning of the original text without unnecessary changes to sentence structure, voice, or verb tense. <br />&bull; Timely completion: Effective fulfillment of language service requests must meet the demands of the schedules and deadlines of end users. <br />&bull; Technical capacity: Documents may have a range of translation technical requirements including standard, semi-technical and technical. Types of translation will cover polished finished translations, subject to review under an established quality control process, resulting in a work product that is accurate, reads smoothly, and consistently uses correct industry-specific terminology; reviews of previously translated documents, and harmonization of translated documents. Translation service covers various written material ranging from general textural documents such as news articles to complex legal documents such as laws, regulations, and legal briefs. Completed translations must incorporate preferred language from any glossaries provided to the vendor by ITEC. <br />&bull; Capacity to handle rush-jobs: Some translation requests will require a quick turn-around (3,000 words translated per 24-h period). Contractor shall have translators who are available to handle this type of request.<br />Security<br />&bull; Due to the sensitivity of much of the material, each contractor shall have an active non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement, and the capacity to store and transmit information securely within the United States.<br />&bull; Contractor translation staff shall be U.S. citizens.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. BACKGROUND</span>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Project, which had as its primary goal the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003. Now, the NHGRI's mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI), Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core over the past 17 years has invested significant resources to develop a state-of-the-art image acquisition and analysis facility for all NHGRI researchers to pursue and accelerate genome research. The LSM 880 2+1 plus Airyscan system allows researchers to image samples very similar to that of the existing LSM 510 NLO system, reducing the learning curve and wait time. Having the same software simplifies the Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core processes, minimizing labor and time and gives researchers the flexibility to image regularly prepared samples either confocally or through the Airyscan mode (1.7x better XY resolution at 488nm) depending on the needs of the project.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span>:</p>
<p>NHGRI Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core Facility is a high-resolution imaging core facility supporting all labs within NHGRI. Microscopy has evolved from basic light microscopes to super-resolution systems and as the technology advances so does the demand for our services. The Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core facility currently has two conventional wide-field fluorescent scopes; a deconvolution/restoration wide-field system; a Spinning Disk/TIRFconfocal system; and a LSM 510 NLO confocal system which all are in full operation. However, the LSM 510 NLO confocal system will no longer be under a service contract agreement (Zeiss has a 7 year cutoff between system versions) due to its age (12 years old). We purpose to upgrade this LSM 510 NLO to the newest LSM 880 2+1 plus Airyscan system using Zeiss' 25% trade-in promotional discount to save the government over $155,000. Since the Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core is running a system almost every day of the week totaling over 5200 hours in 2014 and projected around 5800 hours for 2015. The Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core will need an upgraded system, with a service contract in place, to meet high demand.</p>
<p>The LSM 880 2+1 plus Airyscan system has a unique proprietary Airyscan detection unit consisting of a calibrated 32-element Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (GaAsP) PMT with typical QE &gt;45 % (peak) and adjustable zoom optics (to accommodate different objectives). The 32-element proprietary area detector is arranged in a compound eye fashion where the central element is adjusted to lie on the optical axis. The Airyscan detector is operated in three different modes: super-resolution, variable pinhole and standard confocal. The adjustable zoom optics always ensures that a defined amount of light (1.25 airy units for super-resolution and confocal mode &amp; 3.5 airy units for variable pinhole) is projected onto the detector. In super-resolution mode the Airyscan detector system achieves images with spatial resolutions of 140nm in XY and 400nm in Z when utilizing 488nm excitation and a 63x 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective.</p>
<p>Additionally, the system provides a real-time preview of the super-resolution image while data is being acquired. In variable pinhole mode the Airyscan allows the image optical section size of each image plane to be set after image acquisition during post processing. And in confocal mode a traditional pinhole aperture is used in addition to the detectors 32 GaAsP detection elements. All elements are then summed together to yield a traditional confocal image that can be combined with the two other PMT detectors on the system. In addition to the Airyscan detection unit, the entire 3 channel quasar detector (one GaAsP plus two standard PMTs) is liquid cooled, which improves data handling as well as overall signal to noise in the image. The one channel GaAsP and the red-shifted PMT function in both integration (digital oversampling) or photon counting mode, for extreme imaging flexibility and sensitivity when handling live cells or low expressing samples. The added new image format from 4x1 to 8192x8192 pixels with up to 16 bit depth (65536 gray values) in all PMT and GaAsP channels adds to the image quality researcher's demand. Finally, absolute linear scanner movement to ensure equal pixel dwell-times is a prerequisite for any quantitative studies. Short scanner turnaround times, &gt; 85% of the frame time is effectively used for image acquisition and the OSCiscan for artifact-free, fast and reliable bidirectional scanning without the need of manual adjustment.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) replaces SOL-R7-16-00003.

Request for Information regarding environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software for US EPA, Region 7, Laboratory, Kansas City, KS.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI/Market Survey or any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.

Background
The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information. The contents of the database include descriptions of the analytical service (matrix, method, analytes and reporting limits), customer request information (site, number of samples, locations), specific information about each sample and analysis (location, reference), and the results for each sample (matrix, method, analyte). The four groups of users of this system are laboratory customers, laboratory analysts, laboratory data managers, and static data managers (maintain reference data). The system begins when the customer begins planning the sampling event, continues with sample receipt, analysis, and reporting from the laboratory, and ends with the disposal of samples. 

About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system. Initial reports and forms provide the customer with sample planning information such as number of samples and analytical methods, along with field tags and field sheets for samples. Various in-progress reports are used by chemists and managers to monitor schedules, receive annual summaries, view charges, view results, perform quality control measures, and document sample results. Additionally, all sample data is transmitted electronically from the instrument into the database. Final reports to the customers depend on the needs of the project: standard format, standard format with quality control results, single sample reports, and electronic data transfer into EPA databases. Finally, sample disposal reports document and track whether samples are hazardous and are used as part of the waste disposal program in the laboratory.

The Oracle database has been updated to include SEDD. SEDD is a set of agency and program neutral instructions for developing standardized electronic data deliverable (SEDD) formats for environmental analytical data. The updated Oracle database design adds the capability to store information about sample receipt batches, sample preparation batches, and analytical batches, enabling the production of SEDD 2a, 2b, and 3 types of data deliverables.

Purpose and Objectives

U. S. EPA Region 7 Science and Technology Center (STC, laboratory) is looking for information about environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software. Region 7 is evaluating the next steps to upgrade the current LIMS system, and is interested in learning what possible solutions exist. Region 7 manages sample receipt and analysis for two in-house laboratories and two external (contracted) environmental laboratories. 

Period of Performance: Unknown at this time

Scenarios

1. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for for full replacement of the database and the front-end forms.

<p>The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of F AR 13.106-1 (b)( i ), with Ross Engineering Corp., 540 Westchester Drive, Campbell, CA 95008 for a high voltage latching switch and subordinate parts in support of NEXRAD (Next-Generation Radar) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).</p>
<p>The requirement is to provide a quantity of complete high voltage switches and repair parts. These components are required to support the WSR-88D SLEP Pulse Modulator Upgrade. The complete high voltage switches will be used to support the build of complete pulse modulators and the individual switch components will be used to repair existing pulse modulators prior to upgrading as part of the SLEP.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on NOAA's, National Weather Service (NWS) knowledge that the High Voltage relay used in the NEXRAD design was developed by Ross Engineering and therefore considered as a proprietary design. Since Ross Engineering maintains the proprietary rights for the design of the high voltage switch in question, the Government has little technical data on the design to assist in identifying an alternate part number/vendor.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product:<br />Listed Countries of Origin:<br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [ ___ ] Are, [ ___ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ___ ] Have, [ ___ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [ ___ ] Are, [ ___ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ___ ] Have, [ ___ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br />___ <br />___</p>

<p>5.	Coordinates with the PNC Academy Advisor in developing training for PNC personnel.  Courses should be specifically designed for each supervisory level and officers assigned to operations units as well as cadets.  The courses should include techniques for planning law-enforcement operational strategies using the programs philosophy and crime statistics.</p>
<p>6.	Coordinates training to all those identified operational units with a focus on goals and objectives of the full range of operational policing techniques from foot patrols to special weapons and tactics and include refresher training in ethics, professionalism, and information/intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>7.	Works closely with the Public Ministry to develop a well-defined PNC/Prosecutor relationship and to more clearly define areas of responsibility for all who work in the operational process.</p>
<p>8.	Assists the U.S. Embassy in its overall goal to strengthen and institutionalize the capabilities of Guatemalan law enforcement entities and justice sector personnel, while also ensuring that USG citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law interests are well served.</p>
<p>B.-1 TRAININGS  &amp; DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES<br />1.   Completes the Contracting Officer Representative (PA296) distance-learning (DL)  <br /> course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within 120 of arriving at Post.</p>

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Skopje, Macedonia<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>The Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is the Bureau charged with foreign policy development relating to international crime, drug trafficking, corruption, criminal justice reform, post-conflict/civilian policing, and related issues. In Macedonia, and throughout the Balkans, INL supports criminal justice sector reforms and facilitates effective cross-border and regional law enforcement cooperation. In Macedonia, INL provides training, technical, and material support to police, prosecutors, and judges. INL has a wide array of partners in this effort, including other U.S. agencies, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and commercial providers.</p>
<p>Macedonia is a recipient of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding. INCLE funding assists countries in their fight against transnational crime and illicit threats, including efforts against terrorist networks, the illegal drug trade, and other illicit enterprises. Embassy Skopje receives approximately $1.6M annually in INCLE funding for the following programs: a law enforcement capacity program, implemented by the Department of Justice's Office of International Criminal Investigative Training and Assistance Program (ICITAP) and a justice program aimed at advancing the rule of law and democratic principles. Macedonia, like every other candidate state for the European Union (EU), must demonstrate its capacity to fight organized crime and corruption and bolster public confidence in its justice sector institutions. INL's assistance programs are critical for achieving these goals.</p>
<p>After the formal adoption of the new Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) by the Macedonian Parliament on November 17, 2010, Macedonia began a substantial transformation of its criminal justice system from one that is inquisitorial to one that is more adversarial and closer to the U.S. system. The transformation entails dramatically changing the roles and responsibilities of the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in Macedonia. The centerpiece of this new legislative framework is the adoption of a new CPC, which introduces new concepts into the criminal justice system: prosecutor-led investigations, greater defense rights and responsibilities to gather and challenge evidence, multiple special investigative techniques, direct and cross examination of witnesses, and trials in which the judge presides, rather than investigates.</p>
<p>INL programs in Macedonia have aimed to promote effective, efficient and transparent implementation of the CPC, which will streamline investigations and prosecutions, enhance interagency cooperation, and more effectively address organized crime, corruption, and political interference within Macedonian justice sector institutions. Implementation of this framework will promote greater accountability among justice sector institutions and actors, requiring extensive public outreach and significant monitoring and advocacy on the part of civil society and the media.</p>
<p>Based on recent political events in Macedonia, INL programs plan to focus assistance activity toward addressing both high-level and low-level corruption as a way to increase public confidence in the criminal justice sector. Special emphasis will be on capacity development within the law enforcement and justice sector to effectively investigate and prosecute corruption-related cases. Moreover, INL programs plan to help develop and reform criminal justice institutions that can independently fulfill their mandates, thereby developing sustainable institutions.</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />The purpose of this position is to provide a Legal Advisor to U.S. Embassy Skopje who will serve as the central role in implementing INL programming to support Macedonia's progress toward EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership. This program will be focused on developing the capacity of Macedonia to fight corruption and organized crime through mentoring and practical training for prosecutors and judges. The Advisor will also be expected to formulate innovative, targeted, and sustainable approaches for building the rule of law in Macedonia, to include proper implementation of the CPC.</p>
<p>The Advisor is responsible for in-country management of INL rule of law programs and ensuring that these programs are meeting expectations. The Advisor coordinates activities with the Deputy Chief of Mission, the rule of law political officer in country, and the INL Office of Europe and Asia (INL/EA) Program Officer in Washington, DC. The Advisor also works closely with the management section at Post to ensure proper execution of INL programming. INL seeks applicants with the requisite technical expertise, and a strong management background who are able to operate independently and work with limited resources.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities<br />a. Serve as the Legal Advisor within INL/EA's assistance mission in Macedonia.</p>
<p>b. Provide policy analysis and program guidance to INL, Embassy Skopje, and other USG entities on effective mechanisms for, progress in, and impediments to, achieving reform objectives in Macedonia.</p>
<p>c. Manage, coordinate, and supervise all phases of INL rule of law programs in Macedonia, including sustainment upon completion of projects and supervision of local staff. The incumbent should be able to work independently and cooperatively with INL/EA to ensure that the program and administrative budgets are monitored routinely and that the projects fall within program guidelines notified to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>d. Implement INL rule of law program through training and mentoring. Serve as a trainer for INL-funded training programs. Provide mentoring and technical assistance to prosecutors on a range of issues, focusing on fighting corruption. Identify outside experts, when appropriate, to serve as trainers.</p>
<p>e. Ensure compliance with INL program management policies and procedures, which will include monitoring procurement and end use monitoring; and drafting program planning documents, such as work plans, budget plans, and monitoring and evaluation frameworks.</p>
<p>f. Establish and maintain relationships with Macedonian justice sector and other government officials, including prosecutors, investigators, judges, defense attorneys, civil society, parliamentarians, and other rule of law actors, to include the law enforcement sector. Ensure adequate follow up with study groups and training (train-the-trainer, alumni conferences).</p>
<p>g. Design and monitor assistance programs for the criminal justice sector utilizing a range of methodologies, such as conducting interviews and focus groups, as well as reviewing analytical reports. Ensure program activities develop local capacity. Activities should include a broad range of justice sector actors and there should be a strong emphasis on joint/collective training between different criminal justice groups (i.e. police- prosecutor workshops). Assist Macedonia in attaining EU accession goals by meeting EU benchmarks related to judicial reform and fair trials by hosting local workshops and practical case studies.</p>
<p>h. Coordinate with other implementers in the international donor community, including the European Commission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other donors. Maintain close collaboration with ICITAP, INL grantees, the Public Affairs Section, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>
<p>i. Coordinate with local civil society organizations to develop an understanding of their challenges and needs, assessment of political developments in the country, as well as opportunities for INL support.</p>
<p>j. Focus on establishing guidelines, standard operating procedures, and public diplomacy tools to build alumni networks and develop mechanisms for linking Macedonian criminal justice actors with U.S. and European criminal justice professionals.</p>
<p>k. Provide mentoring on key anti-corruption concepts and tools to improve the justice system's capacity to address corruption. Advise Embassy Front Office and INL/EA on legislative developments impacting the criminal justice sector and share monthly and after-action reports for all discrete training and assistance activities conducted in accordance with the work plan. Assess the impact of political developments on U.S. policy objectives, make recommendations to the Country Team, and keep INL/EA updated on these developments. Develop legal memoranda and technical support on legal issues that may arise in connection with policy or program issues.</p>
<p>l. Cooperate with other sections of the Embassy and other regional INL-funded advisors to facilitate program implementation.</p>

The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>
<p>In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and the conditions or waive the government's requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions. Such changes must be authorized, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to&nbsp;complete a Buildout project at the Alton IL Main Post Office located at 2350 Homer Adams Parkway, Alton, IL 62002. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>&nbsp;<br />The estimated cost range of the project is $1,400,000 to $1,600,000 with construction completion within 160 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>(1) Contractors must be licensed, as may be required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained.</p>
<p>(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.</p>
<p>(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.</p>
<p>(5) Company must submit information for three to five comparable projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as Buildout projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON JANUARY 5, 2016 AT 1:00 P.M. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Bob Ramba, Robert.c.ramba@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on January 13, 2016.</p>
<p>There will be no public opening of offers. All proposal information received is CONFIDENTIAL until award of a contract. Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

<DESC>FMCS has a requirement to procure VOIP services for the agency headquarters and our regional offices. This requirement includes handsets/telephones that have standard communications and internet capabilities. The services are for 300 users, and involves commercially available VOIP services and hardware. The program manager conducted market reseach to determine what vendors exist in the VOIP community that could meet FMCS communications requirement. Based on the results of that market research, the contracting officer determined that it was in the Government's best interest to limit competition to six VOIP vendors as allowed by Simplified&nbsp;Acquisition Procedures (SAP). These vendors will be notified by email. Other vendors may submit a proposal for this solicitation; however, the contracting officer reserves the right to accept or reject that proposal in the best interest of Government under SAP procedures. A Fixed Price Purchase Order for a base year and 3-1 year options will be awarded on January 11, 2016. Responses are due not later than 3:00 PM on December 30, 2015.

STATEMENT OF WORK

TITLE:  Facilitation, support services and logistics for joint U.S. and Russian capture-mark-recapture and age structure survey in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas.

INTRODUCTION
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), in collaboration with several Russian research institutions, conducts research on the Pacific Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens), a species of concern under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and managed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  The Pacific walrus ranges from the Bering Sea to the Chukchi Sea during the winter and summer months with animals inhabiting both US and Russian waters and both countries share a common interest in the conservation and management of the species.  In light of its ice dependency and the retreat of summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea in the past decade, information on stock size and age specific demographic rates are necessary for informed management.  Because little is known about the spatial stock structure of the Pacific walruses in Russian waters, basic demographic data must be collected in Russian waters for a proper assessment of the health of the Pacific walrus population. This approach is required to obtain a complete picture of the walrus population.

The work outlined here includes working with consultants to put together a plan for a bilateral U.S. and Russian research cruise.  This includes the collection of biopsy samples for a genetic capture-mark-recapture experiment and an age structure survey lead by the FWS.  Work will be accomplished using a Russian flagged vessel as a primary platform with skiffs required for the collection of biopsy samples and other biological data.  The cruise will last approximately 4 to 5 weeks and will begin in the middle to late May ending approximately July 1st with start and end dates weather and ice condition dependent.  The age structure survey aims to score at least 4,000 walruses while the mark-recapture aims to collect a minimum of 1,300 biopsy samples in U.S. and Russian waters.    

The ability to conduct the mark-recapture study and age structure survey in both U.S. and Russian waters will facilitate access to the vast majority of the Pacific walrus population so that the study results will apply to the entire population without caveats.  Without this ability, serious doubts about the applicability of the studies will remain jeopardizing the usefulness of the information for management.  Working in Russian waters requires logistical support services from experts familiar with the laws, regulations, and services available for marine biological studies in the region.  

Under the guidance of the chief scientist leading the mark-recapture study (Dr. Patrick Lemons, FWS), the contractor must be capable of support services and logistics for the above work in both U.S. and Russian waters.  This work will occur in phases according to the time sensitive completion of contract and are outlined below.  Included in these phases are the identification of ships and aircraft necessary for the bilateral research cruise, identification and obtaining of the necessary permits and permissions to conduct this effort, contracting a suitable Russian flagged vessel and associated crew, identification of and contracting aerial reconnaissance services to occur over U.S. and Russian waters, identification and contracting of Russian researchers, obtaining licenses and permits for the vessel and conducting research in Russian waters, identification of and obtaining licenses and permits for the collection of biological samples and data in Russian waters, identification of and obtaining licenses, permits and coordination of Russian scientists to work in U.S. and Russian waters, and identification of and obtaining licenses and permits for possession and use of scientific equipment in Russian waters.  The contractor will have to be able to conduct financial transactions for permits and to Russian service providers and vessel operators. The contractor will also work directly with our Russian colleagues at ChukotTINRO, the Kamchatka Branch of the Pacific Geographical Institution, Russian Marine Mammal Council and other Russian partners.  

An integral part of this project is a contingency plan if something comes up that is not the fault of and outside the control of the contractor that prohibits us from working in Russian waters.  The most common example of this is the increase political tension between our two countries makes it difficult to obtain all the necessary permits and permissions.  If such a situation arises, the contractor must be able to then plan for a U.S. only research effort which would not require the chartering of a Russian vessel and a U.S. flagged ship would be suitable.    The mobilization and implementation line items shall include separate proposals and pricing for 1. U.S. and Russian Waters research, and 2. U.S. only research


PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.	Collect skin biopsy samples from walruses of all ages from small boats hauled out on broken sea ice for use in a genetics based capture-mark-recapture project.  
2.	Conduct an age and sex composition survey of walruses hauled out on sea ice.


CONTRACT PERSONNEL
Successful contractor shall have:
1)	a minimum of 3 years working experience in Russia on marine mammals or essentially identical work
2)	experience speaking both Russian and English
3)	the knowledge and expertise of successfully organizing Russian and U.S. research cruises, aerial support, foreign travel
4)	the knowledge and expertise with identifying and obtaining licenses and permits for collection of biological samples and data in Russian waters
5)	experience with identifying and obtaining licenses, permits, and coordination of Russian scientists to work in U.S. and Russian waters
6)	 familiarity with the Jones Act
7)	the ability to work directly with our Russian colleagues at ChukotTINRO, Kamchatka Branch of the Pacific Geographical Institution, Russian Marine Mammal Council and other Russian partners.

SPECIFIC TASKS
Contractor will be responsible for:


Phase 1  The contractor will hire and train a facilitator/project manager to conduct advance planning and also manage phases 2 through 3 of this project. The purpose of annual advance planning to Identify all permits required and any changes to permits or the permitting process, and to submit a timeline for permitting, mobilization and research cruise.      

Phase 2. Consulting and Mobilization.  Russian vessels and aircraft and identification of permits and licenses needed to conduct a bilateral research cruise in both U.S. and Russian waters.
a.	Russian partners and an ice capable primary platform vessel that can house up to 17 scientists, transport and launch up to 4 skiffs, is available for approximately 5 weeks between the middle of May and early July, can pick up and drop off U.S. scientists and research gear at U.S. ports at the beginning and end of the cruise.
b.	Aerial reconnaissance services including specific aircraft with appropriate range and pilot to provide position of walruses on ice in U.S. and Russian waters including identification of airfields, the aircraft that will be used, licenses or permits required.
c.	Identification of permits or licenses required for said vessel to work in U.S. waters.
d.	Identification of permits or licenses required for the scientific work to be completed in Russian waters including age-structure data, biopsy samples, and scientific equipment and.
e.	Contract 3 Russian research partners as identified by ChukotTINRO
f.	Contract vessel identified
g.	Obtain required permits or licenses identified 
h.	Contract aerial reconnaissance services identified
i.	Obtain required permits or licenses for scientific work and equipment identified

Phase 3 (i.e. Research).

a.	Conduct 5 week research cruise in Bering and Chukchi Seas.   Cruises are to start and end in either in St. Paul, or Nome Alaska.

b.       Contingency.  Because of the complications of working in Russia and the political environment   between the U.S. and Russia, we need to have a contingency plan in place in case the permits and permissions fall through for working in Russian waters.  In the event that conditions arise, that are outside of the control and not the fault of the contractor, which prohibit us from working in Russian waters, we would like to resort to a U.S. only research effort.  Under this scenario we would charter a U.S. flagged vessel for use in the U.S. portion of the Bering and Chukchi Seas and require aerial reconnaissance in the U.S. as well.  Everything else being similar, this would require: 
1.	Contract the three Russian research partners identified in Phase 1 
2.	Contract a U.S. vessel 
3.	Contract aerial reconnaissance services in the U.S. only 
4.	Transfer funds to vessel and service providers.

The vendor of this contract is required to help overcome the unique difficulties encountered in Russian to acquire special permits and arrange field logistics in remote regions of eastern Siberia.  The vendor must have an understand the nuances and have unique knowledge of permitting requirements, agencies, and officials in Russian to complete required application processes in an efficient and timely manner.

SPECIFICATIONS:

Individual and 2-seater style and bench seating and occasional tables to be provided. The nature of this Community Living space requires this seating to have a comfort level similar to home environments but handle the abuse of commercial/healthcare needs.
"	A spring constructed seat
"	Higher back
"	Softened dropped arm for ease of in/out and comfort while sitting.
"	Moisture barrier option included

Upholstery Fabrics based on the end-users and the environment have been selected. These fabrics may be treated as COM and are only to be considered - no alternatives, please.

"	CFSTINSON/Verve with Agion, 62153
o	Applied to back and arm cushions
"	RESILIENSE STUDIO/Canyon, Nugget, TCA 007 
o	Applied to seat cushions
"	BENCH SEATING:
"	PAUL BRAYTON/Sicily,SCY-30, Hillside
o	Applied to arm panels
"	RESILIENSE STUDIO/Canyon, Nugget, TCA 007 
o	Applied to seat cushions

HARD SURFACE FINISHES:
"	Wood finishes and metal finishes to include an anti- microbial for infection control within our CLC communities preferred.
DIMENSIONS:
Dimensions of the seating should be substantial to welcome all who might sit.  A standard size of the following was used to accommodate the needs for the spaces-based on these acceptable dimensions. These dimensions or close to within 2" please:

"	Single Seater/29w x 34d x 44h

<p><strong>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</strong></p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br /></strong>Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p><strong>EPIC:</strong> Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p><strong>Base/Repair Facility Access:</strong> Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle Access:</strong> Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p><strong>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided):</strong> On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">The purpose of this notice is to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to provide the NAVAIR Cyber Warfare Detachment (CWD) resilient and full-spectrum cyber warfare capabilities for Naval aircraft, weapons and related Naval aviation systems. The NAVAIR CWD develops and assesses cyber warfare capabilities for mission assurance of Naval aircraft and weapon systems (aircraft, unmanned vehicles, weapons, sensors, etc.) and Naval aircraft support systems (data processing, data links, networks, communications, navigation, mission planning, aviation support equipment, aircraft launch and recovery equipment, maintenance &amp; logistic systems and connections to enterprise/business systems). The strategy of the NAVAIR CWD is to defend the access points to our weapon systems (detect, prevent), survive and continue to operate during enemy engagement, and foster future cyber-hardened acquisition (resilience and response). The CWD is seeking both traditional DoD contractor sources and non-traditional sources in support of its strategy to develop the NAVAIR cyber workforce, improve infrastructure, conduct research &amp; development (R&amp;D), implement the Navy CYBERSAFE program and the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF), conduct Cyber Risk Assessments (CRAs), support Naval Aviation Programs of Record with cyber solutions and full spectrum cyber capabilities, and establish standards and best practices for incorporation into future acquisitions. </span></p>

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>A. Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of the quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under FAR 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows:</p>
<p>1. Technical acceptability: Determining Factor: The vendor will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. A vendor's quotation will be deemed acceptable if all the criteria outlined in the Quote Specifics above (per the SOW) are satisfied.</p>
<p>2. Price: Determining Factor - The vendor whose total prices per line item will be added together to arrive at a total price. The vendor whose price is the lowest will be deemed the "lowest price". The vendor must have completed the quote sheet (Attachment III). The Government will evaluate the vendor's quote with competitive quotes received from other companies in the industry.</p>
<p><br />C. AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. This is a competitive solicitation for quotations on a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable basis conducted in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 13. The Government will award from among the technically acceptable quotes based on price and technical acceptance.</p>

(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 
(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by the date and time specified for receipt of quotes. If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).
(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fed-wire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract-financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.
(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.
(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).
(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).
(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.
(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.
(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).
(6) If applicable, the Fed-wire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.
(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fed-wire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The objectives of the DoD SBIR Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results. <br /><strong><br />Three Phase Program<br /></strong>The SBIR Program is a three-phase program.
<p>Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.</p>
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. SBIR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of SBIR research or technology.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction <br /></strong>The objectives of the DoD STTR Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results. <br /><strong><br />Three Phase Program</strong><br />The STTR Program is a three-phase program.
<p>Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the&nbsp;STTR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.</p>
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-STTR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets.&nbsp;STTR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior STTR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the STTR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of STTR research or technology.</p>

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Jennifer Pacheco Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4586 Email: jennifer.l.pacheco19.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement:MICC - Fort Riley Com: Don Peters donald.w.peters10.civ@mail.mil. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f).

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

We also have the complete tooling of the other three (3) doors that can be viewed by any contractor, but not taken or removed from Hill AFB. Viewing of tooling in Salt Lake City, UT possible during week of Aug 24-28. Notify 424.SCMS.AFMC.RFI.Responses@tinker.af.mil if interested. The 424SCMS, managing this project, does not own the partial tooling available on this particular item (CMXG at Hill AFB owns the tooling). As such, it is not clear if this tooling would be available as government furnished materiel.</p>
<p>3. To what extent must the Bay Door be tested? <br />Answer: It must pass Form Fit Function requirement, demonstrated by test fit on B-2 Aircraft.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor would like to know, since this is a prototype this is going to be produced, can they use cheaper material for prototype production to save time? Answer: Yes you may for preliminary FFF testing to reduce production risk, but the final accepted version must use approved original specified materials, and prove Form/Fit/Function at Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>5. How many planes are expected to be surveyed? <br />Answer: Government will do any surveying if necessary, and contractor involvement can be discussed. Additionally, loft data for aircraft surfaces is available.</p>
<p>6. Is the contractor allowed to repair the prototype door as necessary? <br />Answer: The prototype stage is considered past Critical Design Review (CDR). As such, a MRB action would need government approval. Depending on many factors, the flight suitability of a door would be assessed based on the MRB's against it.</p>
<p>7. Is there any potential for follow-on work? <br />Answer: Possibly. There are currently no spares, and the requirement is 1 to 3. A vendor successful with this project would be a future source of supply for this item should any future requirements arise.</p>
<p>8. Are there any Time Compliance Tech Orders (TCTO's) on the door? <br />Answer: none known.</p>
<p>9. Are rigging instructions available, which may show additional clearance tolerance for fit? <br />Answer: The document is controlled by the B-2 System Program Office, and disclosure may not be possible.</p>
<p>10. Dimensions? <br />Answer: 24ft long, 4ft wide. Tooling would push envelope out roughly a foot in each direction.</p>
<p>11. Will you release process specifications? <br />Answer: As long as the data rights are clear to release.</p>
<p>12. Are the doors a co-cured GR/Ep composite originally with auto-clave cure at 350F? What more can you share as to structural details and material?<br />Answer: Yes, Most all is 3K-70-PW carbon fiber impreg with B-staged epoxy resin (Hexcel 8552S). 350 cure. Also random carbon fiber mat BMS8-302 grade 1. Core : BMS8-124, class 1, type 1 grade varies</p>
<p>13. In repair of such large structure, out-of-autoclave vacuum repairs is proposed where applicable. Is that an acceptable approach for the door?<br />Answer: No, we would not want to qualify another material for this application (Nuclear Capable Bomber).</p>
<p>14. The sources sought mentioned a cure temperature of up to 700F. Those cure temperatures are associated with polyimides or thermoplastics. A Peek resin graphite composite would be a reasonable approach for new construction but not to repair current production doors. I don't see a polyimide composite as needed here.<br />Answer: Up to 700F is listed in the qualification requirement, please list your qualifications and equipment in your RFI response so the USAF can assess capability to produce this item. Materials we expect to encounter are listed above.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BEST VIEWED/DOWNLOADED FROM FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: 16-R-05357.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued December 11, 2015 to add Contract Line Items for data requirements.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units. 

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey. The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the Statement of Work.  

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and options to buy 50 production units of each subassembly. 
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-05357 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation to allow the FAA to determine Best Value.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(g)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 750 employees.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON DECEMBER 29, 2015, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (January 12, 2016).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), â€œif the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.â€

In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, connie.m.houpt@faagov, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, January 12, 2016.  


Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, January 12, 2016, may not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, incorporated by reference in the solicitation.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

Inquiries regarding this SIR/RFO should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

NIJ funds the development of, and provides deployment assistance for, investigative and forensic science technologies. The contractor must have significant experience providing professional scientific, engineering and technical support services to Federal agencies or other entities. While previous experience does not have to be directly related to forensic science, the scientific areas should be translatable to the areas that will be supported by this SOW, which are primarily in the following program areas:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OFFICE OF INVESTIGATIVE AND FORENSIC SCIENCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mission of the Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences (OIFS) is to improve the quality and practice of forensic science through innovative solutions that support research and development, testing and evaluation, technology, information exchange and the development of training resources for the criminal justice community. The OIFS' efforts to accomplish this mission are aligned with the Department's mission, OJP's policies, the NIJ's strategic planning, and Congressional appropriations. The OIFS Director reports to the NIJ Director through the Principal Deputy Director. The OIFS Director oversees seven major programmatic portfolios: Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program Office; Graduate Research Fellowship Program Office; DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program Office; Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Program Office; Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program Office; Missing Persons Program Office; and Cold Cases Program Office. These programs will change as new programs are added and current programs are ended. The OIFS Director is also supported by federal staff that provides expert technical and program management advice and a quality review of each program's planning and performance. The OIFS Director will also integrate and coordinate activities amongst the programs, the Forensic Technology Center of Excellence, the National Commission on Forensic Science, Organization of Scientific Area Committees and other DOJ offices and Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program <br /></span></strong>The goals of the Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program Office are to expand the information that can be extracted from traditional types of forensic evidence, and quantify its evidentiary value; to develop reliable and widely applicable tools and technologies that allow faster, cheaper and/or less labor-intensive identification, collection, preservation and analysis of forensic evidence; and to strengthen the scientific basis of the forensic science disciplines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program will achieve these goals by investing in research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and analysis efforts that will increase knowledge and produce fieldable technologies. Breakthroughs in these areas will create new technologies for use in forensic science laboratories and increase knowledge to support the underlying scientific basis of fielded technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program's technology portfolio focuses on multiple areas that include but are not limited to: Forensic Biology (e.g., DNA analysis, RNA analysis, protein analysis, etc.); Forensic Chemistry (drug chemistry, elemental analysis of trace evidence, chemical analysis of evidence resulting from fires/explosives, etc.); Forensic Anthropology (mass disaster victim identification, medicolegal death investigation, identification of missing persons, etc.); Forensic Pathology (toxicological analysis, medicolegal death investigation, etc.); Imaging and Microscopy (analysis and comparison of impression and pattern evidence, microscopic morphological examination of trace evidence, etc.); Spectroscopy/Spectrometry (crime scene investigation, trace materials and chemical analysis, etc.); Forensic Science Laboratory Methods (instrumental analyses, assay development, etc.); and Forensic Science Data Analysis (development of software, statistical methods, databases, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Graduate Research Fellowships Program</strong></span> <br />The goal of the Graduate Research Fellowship Program Office is to increase the pool of researchers who are involved in providing STEM-based solutions to problems that affect criminal justice policy and practice in the United States. Through the GRF-STEM program, NIJ supports STEM graduate education by investing in academic institutions that support outstanding and promising doctoral students. The program will achieve this goal by competitively awarding fellowship grants to graduate students who are enrolled full-time in doctoral degree programs in STEM disciplines at eligible academic institutions; and have proposed dissertation research topics that are relevant to providing solutions to problems that directly affect public safety, crime, and/or the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program</strong></span> <br />The goals of the DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program Office are to assist eligible States and units of local government to process, record, screen, and analyze forensic DNA and/or DNA database samples, and to increase the capacity of public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories to process more DNA samples, thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic DNA and DNA database samples awaiting analysis. The program will achieve these goals by providing financial assistance in the form of grants and cooperative agreements to States and units of local government with existing accredited crime laboratories that conduct forensic DNA and/or DNA database sample analysis with the ability to upload data to the National DNA Index System (NDIS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program</span></strong> <br />The goals of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program Office are to (1) carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science or medical examiner services in the State, including those services provided by laboratories operated by the State and those operated by units of local government within the State; (2) eliminate a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence, including, among other things, a backlog with respect to firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questioned documents, and trace evidence; and (3) train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel as needed to eliminate such a backlog. The program will achieve these goals by providing both formula and competitive grant awards to States to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner services, including services provided by laboratories operated by States and/or units of local government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program<br /></span></strong>The goal of the Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence to Exonerate the Innocent Program Office is to assist States and units of local government with post-conviction DNA testing in cases of violent felony offenses where actual innocence might be demonstrated. The program will achieve these goals by competitively awarding grants to States, units of local government, and public institutions of higher education to assist in defraying the costs associated with post-conviction case review, evidence location, and DNA testing in violent felony cases where the results of such testing might show actual innocence.<br />Missing Persons Program <br />The goals of the Missing Persons Program are to facilitate the association of unidentified human remains with known reference samples. The program will achieve these goals in two ways: (1) through the Using DNA Technology to Identify the Missing Program which provides financial assistance to States, units of local government, nonprofit and for-profit organizations, institutions of higher education, and certain qualified individuals to perform DNA analysis on unidentified human remains and family reference samples to support the efforts of States and units of local government to identify missing persons, and (2) by supporting the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) Program which is a national centralized repository and resource center for missing persons and unidentified decedent records. NamUs is a free online system that can be searched by medical examiners, coroners, law enforcement officials and the general public from all over the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cold Cases Program</span></strong> <br />The goal of the Cold Cases Program is to utilize advances in DNA technology to facilitate the successful resolution of cold cases. The program will achieve these goals by providing assistance to States and units of local government to identify, review, and investigate Uniform Crime Report Part 1 Violent Crime "cold cases" that have the potential to be solved through DNA analysis, and to locate and analyze biological evidence associated with these cases.</p>

The contract will be awarded to Bentley Systems, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.</p>
