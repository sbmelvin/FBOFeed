<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to five Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  This solicitation is a total 100% Set aside for 8(a) small businesses located within the geographical area serviced by the SBA in North Carolina, South Carolina Virginia, Georgia and Tennessee and other 8(a) firms having a ëbona fide branch officeí located within the geographical boundaries.  The Government reserves the right to award fewer than five contracts if sufficient number of acceptable proposals are not submitted to make more awards.  The work will consist of general construction with associated electrical work and incidental related work at Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Marine Corps Air Station, New River, Jacksonville, North Carolina and Other Military Installations/Sites in North Carolina.  Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Contract (MAC) approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), awardees, will compete for task orders based on best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  The task order is written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scoping of work.  The contractor(s) shall provide all labor, supervision, engineering, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies, and transportation to perform all of the services described in the basic contract and subsequent task orders.  The work may consist of new construction, demolition, repair, total/partial interior/exterior alteration/renovation of buildings, systems and infrastructure; civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, communication systems; installation of new or extensions to existing high voltage electrical distribution systems, extensions to the existing high pressure steam distribution systems, extensions to the potable water distribution systems, extensions to the sanitary sewer systems, additional storm water control systems; painting,  removal of asbestos materials and lead paint, and incidental related work. Design/build projects may also be considered for this contract. Types of buildings and facilities include administrative, industrial, warehouses, maintenance, communications, schools/training/education, personnel support, recreational, food services, training areas/ranges, roads, etc.     Each contract will be awarded for a maximum not-to-exceed amount of $3,000,000.00 per year with a total maximum not-to-exceed amount of $15,000,000.00 per contract for five years (base year and four option years).  The minimum guarantee is $5,000.00 per contract over the full term of the contract to include option years.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The first IDIQ construction contract of the five will be awarded with a firm fixed price, 100% design as the seed project.  This is a RFP, which requires submission of technical and price proposals.  Evaluation for award will be based on technical factors including (Factor 1)  Corporate Experience, (Factor 2) Past Performance, (Factor 3) Management and Organization, (Factor 4) Safety and (Factor 5) Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  Management and Organization has subfactors which are:  (3A) Quality Control, (3B) Management Approach and (3C) Bonding Capability.  Safety has subfactors (4A) Experience Modification Rating (EMR), (4B) OSHA Lost Work Day Rate, (4C) OSHA Recordable Incidents Rate and (4D) Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA Citations.  Small Business Subcontracting Effort has subfactors (5A) Small Business Past Performance and (5B) Participation of Small Businesses in this Contract.  Technical factors 1 through 5 are of equal importance.  Technical subfactors are of equal importance.  It will also be based on pricing full plans and specifications for the seed project, N62470-01-R-2179, Refurbish Building AS804 at Marine Corps Air Station, New River, Jacksonville, North Carolina, which has an estimated cost range of $100,000.00 to $250,000.00.  After initial award of the seed project, the selected Contractor(s) will be required to participate with the Government in an on-site scoping meeting for any upcoming projects.  The seed project shall be issued as a task order to one of the selected MAC contractors.  The task order award determination shall be based on the overall technical ratings and price which together constitute a best value to the Government; however, not necessarily the lowest price.  All five Contractors will compete on subsequent task orders.  These subsequent projects will be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design.  They will be scoped by the Government/Contractor team and may not have traditional plans and specifications but may include sketches and requests for catalog cuts and other submittals.  The salient requirements of the task orders will be scoped by the Government/Contractor team in order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work (SOW).  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order; however, pricing will be weighted heavily.  The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should the second, third, fourth or fifth IDIQ Contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award considerations may be modified in order to ensure each participating Contractor is awarded task orders meeting the minimum guarantee over the full term of the contract to include option years.   All initial awarded Contractors will be required to participate in all MAC walk-throughs and submit proposals.  Failure to participate responsibly in walk-throughs and failure to submit proposals may result in the Contractor forfeiting its minimum guarantee, the Government not soliciting the Contractor proposals for future task orders or exercising the option to extend the contract for an additional year.  The contract will be awarded to the best value offeror in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 15.  Only the five selected Contractors will be permitted to propose on the task orders.  Proposals from another Contractor will not be accepted.  A minimum of two proposals will satisfy the competitive requirements of MAC and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the proposers is not able to participate in the process.  Proposed contract is a total 100% Set Aside for 8(a) small business with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 236220 and Size Standard of $28.5 Million.  No public bid opening will be held.  Small Businesses are required to submit the information outlined in Section M.  Plans and specs will be available on or about 23 June 2004.
