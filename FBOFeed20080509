<DESC>The 677 Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG), Wright-Patterson AFB OHplans to negotiate and extend the period of performance of existing delivery orders 0050 and 0054 issued under contract F33657-98-D-0005 for the continued operation and maintenance of the B-2 Training System (TS) on a sole source basis to L3 Communications, Link Simulation & Training, Arlington TX.  The period of performance will be extended for a period of probably less than 6 months, but not exceeding 12 months or Dec 2009. This effort will keep critical operational training available until the contractor selected under an anticipated follow-on competitive action (FA8621-08-R-6250) can fully and seamlessly take over responsibilities operating and maintaining the B-2 Training System (TS) and training B-2 aircrew and maintenance personnel.
The authority for the sole source is FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A determination not to compete this effort will be made because L3 Communications, Link Simulation & Training, Arlington TX is the only source capable of providing the required services.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Any response to this notice must be submitted by May 23, 2008.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Betty Clingerman via e-mail at betty.clingerman@wpafb.af.mil.

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies (DRDS), Morgantown, West Virginia hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to The American College of Radiology for the training for health care professionals in the International Labor Office (ILO) Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses. Background and Need - Since the passage of the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, officials from NIOSH involved in managing the periodic radiographic screening program for coal miners mandated by the Act have recognized a need for professionally competent medical and technical advice and guidance in making high quality chest radiographs and interpreting them according to a uniform, universally acceptable system of classification. Professional advice and guidance have been provided through a series of contractual agreements which have assisted in establishing and reviewing professional standards in 1) developing Federal regulations which were promulgated to implement the x-ray examinations program mandated by the 1969 Act; 2) making and interpreting chest roentgenograms of the pneumoconioses, 3) training physicians in the ILO Classification system; 4) training radiological technologists in the techniques required to make radiographic images of a quality acceptable for accurate classification of the pneumoconioses; 5) evaluating and approving x-ray facilities and physicians wishing to participate in the x-ray examinations program for coal miners; 6) assisting in updating and modernizing the ILO classification system, including revisions adopted by the ILO in 1980 and in 2002; and 7) reviewing the radiological aspects of selected program activities, surveillance and research protocols, investigations, and results concerning persons with or subject to occupational respiratory diseases.
<p>The NIOSH Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program, and other public or private research, surveillance, and public health activities which use chest radiographs, require the services of physicians who are competent in evaluating chest radiographs for evidence of the pneumoconioses using the most up-to-date standards. In addition to the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program, other Federal regulations such as the OSHA Asbestos Standard have been promulgated that require employers to provide chest radiographic surveillance to at-risk employees. These programs require the radiographs to be interpreted by a physician according to the most recent classification standards. Thus, adequate numbers of competent physicians are needed for Federal and non-Federal occupational health programs, and for research, surveillance, and other public health activities.</p>
<p>As the current group of qualified health care professionals retire or otherwise cease to be involved in the classification of radiographs, there is a continuing need to train health care professionals in the process of evaluating chest radiographs for evidence of the pneumoconioses and in the use of the current ILO Classification System for systematically, accurately, and reproducibly describing radiographic changes associated with pneumoconioses.</p>
<p>Project Objective - Provide a training course for health care professionals during or around March 2009. The course should use a lecture format, as well as provide extensive practicum instructional experience, to cover current issues related to the pneumoconioses and to familiarize the trainees with the specific methods, procedures, and equipment needed for the appropriate and accurate application of the ILO Classification System for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses. After completing the course, individual participants will be prepared to sit for a comprehensive examination evaluating their mastery of the materials and techniques presented for the appropriate and accurate application of the ILO Classification System.</p>
<p>Scope of Work - The vendor will provide all labor, materials, facilities, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements - <br />1. Conduct a training course for health care professionals on the radiology of the pneumoconioses, as well as current issues related to the epidemiology, pathology, and medical aspects of the pneumoconioses.

<p>System control and data collection specifications</p>
<p>15. Programmable logic controller or computer to automatically control the cycle through all sample tubes, in any specified order and frequency will be provided. The desired system will sample each tube at least every 4 hours. <br />16. The system will analyze calibration and span gases every week of operation.<br />17. The system will monitor and record the vacuum on each sample tube with an appropriate degree of precision.<br />18. The system will monitor and record the barometric pressure at least every hour. <br />19. A data collector will record all gas analysis, calibration, sample-draw pressure and barometric pressure results from each sample tube each sampling cycle. The storage device will have sufficient capacity to hold gas analysis readings and time data from at least six months of continuous operation.</p>
<p>Data display and analysis software specifications</p>
<p>20. The data display and analysis software system will be based on a Windows interface.<br />21. The software system will display the mine plan where the system is installed and the sample point locations.<br />22. The software system will display current gas composition data for each point and give the history of that composition on command.<br />23. The software system will display composition data and trends on both a Coward triangle and an Ellicott diagram on command.<br />24. The software system will provide notification and sound appropriate alarms when critical composition thresholds are exceeded.<br />25.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices/Procurement Services Division (DO/PSD), on behalf of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) Office anticipates the competitive award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a  base period plus four one-year option periods.  The anticipated contract type will include four fixed priced, and five time and material Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for a facility and data system capable of implementing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-297, 116 Stat. 2322) (TRIA), as amended, including the Department of the Treasurys Program regulations.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 524292 with a standard size of $6.5 million.
The Department of the Treasury will order a minimum amount of $250,000 under this contract.  Treasury will have the entire term of the contract (to include all options) to fulfill the contract minimum. The specific CLINs and services will be identified in the individual task orders issued under this contract. The exercise of the renewal options does not re-establish the contract minimum. During the life of this contract, Treasury may order items in any quantity up to the maximum amount of $30 million for the entire term of the contract, including all options that may be exercised.

The TRIP Office mission is to implement TRIA as amended. The link for the TRIP website is http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/terrorism-insurance/. The Department of the Treasury, TRIP regulations are identified under their own tab.  Legislation texts are included under the Resources tab. The original 2002 TRIA, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 are included. Also, under the Federal Share Claims Process tab is the link to a demonstration claims processing site.   

TRIAs purposes are to address market disruptions, ensure the continued widespread availability and affordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to allow for a transition period for private markets to stabilize and build capacity while preserving state insurance regulations and consumer protections.  

The contract requires the contractor to translate TRIA and related regulations into tested and documented operating systems and procedures for the processing of insurer claims for the Federal Share of Compensation. Following a qualifying terrorist event  and upon notice, the contractor will activate the facility, process claims  and operate as statistical agent for the Program.  A brief description of each task is as follows:  CLIN 001: The contractor shall transition, prepare and test a claims management facility; CLIN 002: The contractor shall perform periodic review and readiness testing to include system certification and accreditation; CLIN 003: The contractor shall provide expert analytical support; CLIN 004: The contractor shall perform activation and on-going operation of the claims management facility; CLIN 005: The contractor shall transition and develop and test a statistical agent analysis and reporting capability; CLIN 006: The contractor shall perform periodic review and testing of the statistical agent capability and ensure system security and certification and accreditation; CLIN 007: The contractor shall provide for statistical agent reporting and analysis following activation; CLIN 008: The contractor shall provide for recoupment; and CLIN 009: The contractor shall perform close-out and/or transition of operations.

The solicitation is anticipated to be posted on or after April 14, 2008 on FedBizOpps, the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for federal government procurement opportunities over $25,000. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this announcement.  All information regarding the solicitation documents and amendments will only be made available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities web site; http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award to 8(A)  

10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06. The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423450 and the size standard is 500 employees. The government intends to award a name brand commercial delivery order to Goldbelt Raven LLC, using the existing ARMEC (Army Research Medical Equipment and Consumables) contract. The requirement is to purchase: KODAK RVG 6100 SIZE # 2 (6 EA) P/N: 6100-SEN2-ONLY, KODAK RVG 6100 #1 SENSOR (4 EA) P/N: 6100-SEN1-ONLY and UID services (20 EA).  The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows: Kodak sensors provide digital imagining of dental X-ray?s that can then be globally accessed on the dental digital radiology system (DDRS). This unique sensor is the cutting edge of technology and improves the efficiency, productivity, and profitability of USAFA dental clinic. Our requirement is for the sensor that provides an image that is superior to film. The use of digital radiography will significantly improve the overall quality of care given to our patients. Film images are instantaneously produced, speeds up clinical diagnosis, decreases patient waiting time, and increases efficiency. This will eliminate the cost of film and the need for conventional film processing and will decrease chemical hazards (lead & chemistry) as well as hazardous wastes. Kodak is the most versatile integration system on the market with the best image quality. All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. Any company that feels they can provide an equal product that meets all the governments requirements as stated above must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 19 May 2008 at 0800 hour Mountain Time. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Point of Contact is Sam Richmond, Contract Specialist (719) 333-3948 email: (patricia.richmond@usafa.af.mil) or alternate Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer (719) 333-3961 email: leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, Lori Staples 8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103 USAFA, CO 80840 Telephone number 719-333-3907 FAX 719-333-9018 email: lori.staples@usafa.af.mil Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements in the attached description.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  Any interested sources may respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.

The contractor will review the IT functionality of each specific contract to determine if the fielded system capabilities match the prescribed full operational capacity (FOC) as contracted for in the initial contract instrument.   BACKGROUND The RMS system is a logistical system used to initiate, review and approve repair, general maintenance and spare parts requests.  This system allows for budgetary approval at various levels (and in various locations), determination of actual expenses and forecasting. It is estimated that MARAD has over 900 user IDs for this system.  However, approximately half (1/2) are active users.  The system is installed on 44 ships, at three MARAD operating areas offices, at eight Ship Manager locations, at two contractor sites and at MARAD headquarters office.  The IT infrastructure is owned by the Government but managed by Stanley Associates.  Site visits may be required of the contractor.  However, ship visits are not anticipated.   PHASE I CONTRACT REVIEW 1.	Review the MARAD functional requirements of the Ready Reserve Force Management System (RMS), as awarded to ABS Nautical Systems and ABS Consulting via the following contract instruments, and the latest modification: a.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with 
Step Tools, for purchase of  Part Number STS21000-2 ST-Machine Software Maintenance STA2000-1 Software for Seimens 840D Computer numerical controller. Period of Performance 4/24/08 through 4/24/09. 

ST-Developer is a software library that provides a C++ programming interface for reading and writing data in ISO 10303 (STEP) format. Although ISO 10303 data is a standard, the C++ functions for reading and writing this data are vendor-specific. Several vendors provide software
programming libraries for STEP, such as STEP Tools (our sole source) and EPM Tools. NIST has extensive software written using the STEP Tools vendor-specific programming functions in ST-Developer, and no other company provides these vendor-specific functions. We estimate that our investment in the software we have written using ST-Developer is on the order of tens of person-years. Switching to another product, while possible, would require that we learn the new vendor-specific functions, re-write our software code base, and test it. The cost and time associated with such a re-write would be prohibitive. For this reason, we are requesting that STEP Tools Inc. be selected as the sole source for the ST-Developer product. 

Step Tools is the only source able to perform the entire work required. 

 The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Clemson University Research Foundation of Clemson, South Carolina for the purchase of a Ball Bar Calibration Machine under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Precision Engineering Department of NIST’s Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory requires a Ball Bar Calibration Machine to calibrate long scale bar to accommodate increased need for this type of artifact (scale bar).  This increased need is due to the recent publication of SAME B89.4.19, which requires the use of a reference length (which can be established using a scale bar) for laser tracker testing.

Sole source determination is based on NIST’s need for a Ball Bar Calibration Machine that is capable of providing calibrations of laser tracker measuring systems using reference artifacts.  These artifacts are typically cylindrical, approximately 2.3 meters in length, and have kinematic nests at their ends.  These kinematic nests hold spherically mounted retroreflectors, which are used as measurement targets for laser trackers.

Since the Ball Bar Calibration Machine is of a design and manufacture that is proprietary and unique to the Clemson University Department of Mechanical Engineering, and meets all of NISTs specifications and requirements, we require this order to be sole sourced to Clemson University Research Foundation. 

A Sources Sought notice for this requirement was posted on FedBizOpps from March 27, 2008 through April 9, 2008.  No vendors responded to this Sources Sought notice except the Clemson University Research Center.
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on May 26, 2008.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Tufts University; Vitamins and Carcinogenesis Laboratory; 711 Washington Street; Boston, MA 02111 for measuring genomic methylation in leukocyte DNA for the association with lymphoma in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO).

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requirement is to determine whether the levels of a molecular marker, namely genomic methylation of leukocyte DNA are lower among people who later develop lymphoid cancers than people who do not.  NCI researchers have identified 320 cases and 320 controls in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial cohort.  It is of special interest to study lymphoma risk using this marker in leukocytes, considering leukocytes include lymphocytes, the target tissue of the malignancy.   The NCI requires the quantification of the methylcytosine content in the whole genomic DNA.

Period of Performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.  Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.

Tufts University, more specifically, the Vitamins and Carcinogenesis Laboratory, is the only source known to the NCI that are leading experts in the research of global DNA methylation.  They are the only laboratory known that is suitable for reliable high-quantity assays of epidemiologic samples for global methylation status.  In addition, Tufts University, Vitamins and Carcinogenesis Laboratory, can provide complete whole genomic methylation, is the only source of this measurement, and has established and refined the procedure.  Changing variables at this time would be detrimental to the current research, experiments, and trials being performed within the NCI.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM ET, on May 23, 2008.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  

In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-80074-NG on all correspondence.

The Design Build Contractor (DBC) shall analyze the site conditions and propose the most cost effective system which meets NPS requirements. The project will include, but is not limited to the following:"	Evaluate and propose location of water storage tank and routing of fire mains to minimize disturbance of archeologically sensitive areas. Possible tank locations are shown on Attachment 2 in the project scope of services document."	Evaluate and propose the most cost effective type of water storage tank installation, which could include a buried installation, exterior above-ground installation, or indoor installation. Factors to be considered include cost of excavation, freeze protection, and code compliance. Note that NFPA 22 requires full sprinkler coverage for buildings which house water storage tanks. Therefore, an indoor tank proposal must include any upgrades (including fire protection) necessary to meet the full requirements of NFPA 22, for any additional building which may be selected to house an indoor tank."

The NPS desires to avoid disturbing historic artifacts which are presumed to be buried throughout the area. Where excavation is required, archeological investigation will be necessary. The Park's Archeologist will take the lead on testing direction and guidance, as archeological testing will be paid for by the NPS and contracted separately. The amount of excavation and trenching shall, as much as possible, be kept to a minimum and routed to avoid sensitive locations as much as practical. All excavation is subject to NPS approval.  All correspondence regarding the solicitation contents or general questions must be addressed in writing on the firm's letterhead, containing a point of contact (POC), the solicitation number, and phone and fax numbers and must be addressed or e-mailed to the Contract Specialist listed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO NOTIFY INDUSTRY OF THE USAF INTENT FOR CONTRACT ACTION AND POSSIBLELY GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER POTENTIALLY QUALIFIED SOURCES AND THEIR SIZE CLASSIFICATIONS (SMALL BUSINESS, LARGE BUSINESS, ETC.) PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST. The 412 Electronic Warfare Group (EWG), Edwards AFB, CA, intends to solicit a order for a Portable Calibration Unit. The contractor shall perform to build, integrate, test, deliver, install, and verify a Portable Calibration Unit (PCU) for the CEESIM (Combat Electromagnetic Environment Simulator) radar threat signal simulators at the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF), Edwards AFB, California. The basic CEESIM design is composed of a digital simulation and control component, called the Digital Generation System (DGS), and RF generation components, in the form of RF generator channels and RF transmit carts. To ensure the accurate RF representation of simulated signals, each CEESIM channel must be calibrated. Channels are calibrated one at a time using software executing on the DGS component, and using &ldquo;monitor and calibration&rdquo; racks containing software-controlled test equipment. During real-time execution of the simulation, a DGS is fully utilized to control the connected RF channels. Hence, if all simulators are being used for their intended purpose, no calibrations can be performed on remaining RF channels not being utilized. Furthermore, with only two sets of monitor and calibration racks, no more than two channels can be calibrated simultaneously in the best case. The Portable Calibration Unit provided by this contract will be used to perform RF channel calibration independent of the valuable DGS and test equipment rack assets. Off-the-shelf test equipment will be used for calibration measurements. All relevant calibration functionality provided by the baseline CEESIM system will be available (frequency calibration, transmit linearization, transmit alignment, HFIM linearization, &amp; HFIM DC offset adjustment), and with multiple PCUs, calibration of several RF channels will be possible simultaneously with real-time simulator operation. The contract will consist of requirements that are detailed in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). This requirement is for ALL services identified in the PWS. Any qualified and interested companies responding to this announcement must be able to support all areas. NO partial support responses from industry will be accepted. The Government is seeking only, qualified, experienced sources interested in performing the services identified in the attached PWS. The contractor must have current expertise in the electronic warfare systems.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the natural gas distribution (NAICS 221210) and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Little Rock Air Force Base (AFB), Arkansas.
Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.     The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater utility systems at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.     Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.     Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.     Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.     Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, March 13, 2008.   Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:     (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).     The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.     As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.   Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.     

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

<RESPDATE>061008
<CONTACT>Jay D Cohen, Contracting Officer, Phone 540-542-2133, Fax 540-542-2632, Email jay.cohen1@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>This synopsis is to solicit responses which the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center(MWEOC) will utilize to select a contractor for negotiations leading to the award a contract to be used for the acquisition of Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services for the facility in Mount Weather, Virginia. The A-E services to be provided under the proposed procurement consist of design, furnishing of labor, management, facilities, supplies, equipment, reproduction services and miscellaneous materials/services necessary to accomplish the classified intent of the Statement Of Work(SOW). Specifically, in unclassified terms, the SOW entails the need to incorporate the findings of a recently completed Electro Magnetic Pulse(EMP) vulnerability assessment and the existing site topological &amp; utility plans to be able to create a complete EMP facility hardness design package which will allow the Government to make potential aperture point-of-entry(POE) corrective actions either in-house or with the assistance of a construction contractor via a separate contract vehicle. The design package shall support all EMP design recommendations(ie shielding POE's, threat level illumination, survivability of hardened facilities with mission critical equipment &amp; training) as to the selection of new equipment, sizing of materials and apparatus requirements for civil, architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical designs. Where required, POE protection calculations shall determine sizes, strengths, capacities and ratings, such as required for communications systems, piping systems, ducting systems, electrical power, etc.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 (Brooks Act) selection procedures apply. The following is a listing of criteria that will be used in the preliminary screening of the A-E firms responding to this synopsis. A-E firms must meet these requirements to be considered for the work: 1. Provide a completed Standard Form 330(parts I &amp; II). 2. Hold a TOP SECRET facility clearance and have appropriate engineers and support staff that hold active TOP SECRET clearances. 3. Have project managers and consultants that hold a professional degree and are licensed professional engineers or registered architects. 4. Have the lead office located within 300 miles from Mount Weather, Virginia. 5. Have a minimum of 10 employees located at the lead office.

<p>Responding firms not providing all required information may be negatively evaluated. SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criteria responses. The top three firms chosen by the final selection board will be required to participate in an interview process and make a technical presentation to the selection board. The interview and presentation will occur either remotely via teleconference/videoconference or at the MWEOC site. Evaluating past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, inaccessible points of contact, or invalid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. All projects provided in the SF 330 (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) must be completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work. Projects not performed by the office/branch/individual team member will be excluded from evaluation consideration. In the submittal, the A-E firm shall clearly define the location of the lead office as well as detail their ability to handle TOP SECRET information.

A previous RFI was issued for a DFI S-Band telemetry system in February 2008 whichincluded preliminary information.  However, it was well noted that comprehensiveenvironmental and performance conditions for perspective hardware were incomplete andwere not available at that time.  This request includes more comprehensive informationabout system operation, storage, and transport environmental requirements, as well astest and verification parameters in the form of attachments containing a draft Statementof Work and Component End Item (CEI) Specifications which are hereby posted for comments. Previously submitted information may be updated and resubmitted based on the additionalinformation.  No further updates or revisions to any of these documents are expectedbefore the deadline.  No further SS/RFIs are expected to be issued over this component.The anticipated type of procurement action will be to obtain S-Band coaxial cable for atelemetry system.  The entire telemetry system will consist of an S-Band transmitter,antennae, and associated connecting coaxial cable.  A procurement of commerciallyavailable components that are configured to meet NASAs specific function is expected. The contractor will be expected to provide requested system components, teaming orsubcontracting is acceptable provided each role is explicitly discussed.  Some componentswill also need to undergo spaceflight qualification (i.e. environmental) testing prior todelivery.  Flight units will also need to undergo acceptance testing (3 line items: commercial unit, commercial units spaceflight qualified, commercial units acceptancetested prior to flight).  A fourth line item for technical support is also anticipated. An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is anticipated where minimum andmaximum number of components over a five year period will be specified.  The contractorwill be expected to be able to either perform the environmental and space flightqualification testing, or subcontract for it.The following information is requested after reviewing the SOW and Specificationsdocuments:1.	(1) Please comment on the viability of providing S-Band coaxial cable hardware atthe proposed center frequency, bandwidth, transmitter power, and environment;2.	(2) Please comment on your ability to provide S-Band coaxial cable hardware,including verification and validation of flight test requirements;3.	(3) It is assumed that a slightly modified or reconfigured commercial item willbe procured, however, if the requirements indicate that commercial item procurement maynot be possible, please inform us;4.	(4) Do any requirements in the documents indicate a significant price increasefrom your standard commercially available hardware;5.	(5) Please identify if there is anything unclear in the SOW or specificationsdocuments.6.	(6) Please comment on qualification and acceptance testing procedure areas whichmay be combined or inferred for cost  and time savings;7.	(7) Will having to be determined (TBD) and to be resolved (TBR) items(specifications portions to be finalized after award) pose a problem with proposing afirm fixed price for performance?  If so, please comment on the affected areas.8.	(8) Will having technical support priced by the hour pose a problem? (The actualamount of technical support is unknown and is anticipated to be procured by the hour witha not to exceed number of hours specified in the actual procurement).9.	(9) Do you normally provide some number of technical support hours to assist withhardware integration and test?BackgroundThe Upper Stage is the second stage of NASAs new Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle.  In orderto gather the data needed to support flight performance and model verification,Development Flight Instrumentation is planned to fly as an independent system on thefirst five Ares I development test flights.The Ares I Upper Stage Project is led by the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center (MSFC) inHuntsville, Alabama.  On behalf of the Upper Stage Avionics and Flight SoftwareIntegrated Product Team at NASA MSFC, the NASA Glenn Research Center is responsible fordesigning, developing, testing and delivering the Upper Stage DFI system.The DFI S-Band Telemetry System will collect and transmit DFI vehicle data from the Upperstage and J-2X engine directly to the Earth-based ground monitoring stations of NASAsCommunications & Tracking Network (CTN).  The DFI Upper Stage telemetry system includesone transmitter mounted inside the instrument unit (IU) of the CLV Upper Stage, and anantennae system mounted externally on the vehicle.  All Upper Stage CLV DFI telemetrysystem hardware is considered expendable after an approximate ten minute operationalflight time.A vendor survey indicated that commercially available telemetry components may satisfythe radio frequency S-band performance requirements of the Upper Stage DFI telemetrysystem.  Consequently, it is expected that the US DFI telemetry system will be based oncurrently available upper S-band frequency commercial transmitter, antennae and coaxialcable components configured to support the data transmission rates required for the AresI Upper Stage DFI.  In addition, the telemetry system components must pass space flightqualification and acceptance testing to be performed by the contractor per NASArequirements.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to contract for services for the requirement entitled:  Developing More Effective Strategies for Interconception Care.
This requirement is intended to implement an Interconception Care quality improvement model for all Federally-funded Healthy Start (HS) projects through the use of learning collaborative models. 

Research indicates that select interventions provided during the interconception period (the duration of time from the end of one pregnancy to the next pregnancy or 24 months postpartum) are associated with a reduction in future adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, fetal loss, infant mortality, and birth defects.  Specifically, this contractor shall assist HS projects in the following areas:
1.	Meeting the challenges in enhancing the content of their required interconception care component (ICC) so as to improve their risk screenings/referrals for periodontal diseases and caries, depression, obesity, diabetes, HIV, cervical cancer, STDs, and other conditions; 
2.	Developing and implementing effective intensive evidence-based interconception care and care coordination models for women at high medical and social risk to include possible use effective strategies currently used by peer projects.  The models will include quality improvement activities within an HS project area to achieve local systems changes, infrastructure development, and behavioral changes with, and among family, providers and the community, including the projects along the US-Mexican border, Alaska and Hawaii.

The Contractor will be required to produce the following deliverables:
1.	A quality improvement interconception care model designed by experts in the field assisting HS project teams (who come from HS communities) to focus on key areas that have been demonstrated to create positive change.
2.	A collaborative learning model process to effect change within HS projects by the completion of the anticipated three-year contract period.
3.	A final report that analyzes and summarizes the issues, methods, and findings from the HS ICC quality improvement project and provides recommendations to for future strategies to improve infant and maternal health outcomes and reduce health disparities through HS ICC services. 

Qualified contractors must satisfy the following minimum requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your company's experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following requirements:  
1.	Demonstrated familiarity with the collaborative model, preferably with previous experience developing and implementing collaborative models.
2.	Experience in the field of in the field of public health with a focus in maternal and child health, preferably to include health disparities and interconception/preconception care.

In addition, it is preferable that the Contractor has experience working with federal contracts meeting deadlines while maintaining flexibility in the work process.    

A cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated, for a period of three years.  This is a new requirement.  The NAICS Code is 541611, with a small business size standard of $6.5m.

Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 (Limitations on Subcontracting).  Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.

Responses to this notice shall be limited to 25 pages and must include:
1.	Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.

Agency:  Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch 
At this time, the Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch, intends to award a five year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for Independent Systems Engineering, Technical Support, & Scientific Services (ISETS&SS).  If the results of this market survey indicate there are no potential qualified sources that can support this proposed effort, the Government will consider issuing a sole source contract.  The estimated ceiling is $100,000,000.00 for this effort.  It is recommended that the Contractor operate exclusively in the public interest.   Specifically, the Government requires this support for their requirements to alleviate potential conflicts with recommendations on future products and services. The requirement includes that the Contractor shall be prohibited from participating in competition as a prime, subcontractor, or consultant for the Government of any items and/or services to be furnished and other contracts based on any work performed under this contract.  The term "Contractor" includes Contractor personnel, subcontractors, and consultants.  All Contractor personnel shall be considered procurement officials and will be subject to the provisions of Section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41.U.S.C. 423).  The ISETS&SS will require support and services in the following seven (7) areas:  Technology Management - Supporting needs identification, acquisition, operation, hardware and software servicing and replacement, including initiatives such as recommending technology policies and architectural direction to achieve best value of technology or conducting risk assessments of critical-technology initiatives.  This area also includes support for the establishment and maintenance of system and/or program integration services in support of multiple government agencies. Evolution Planning - Provide support of strategic planning and recommendations on the evolution of business processes and system architectures, and the adoption of new technologies; Technology Evaluation - Provide high-level, expert technical support for agencies evaluating and selecting appropriate technologies and products; including consideration of the long-term and broad range needs of the government; and conduct proof of concept feasibility studies; Systems and Services Acquisition - Perform analyses and research in support of the acquisition of technologies and services.  Includes such things as support to program managers, modeling, demonstrating, and manage technology systems, and related services; Independent Validation and Verification - Conduct independent review and testing of acquired technologies to ensure the technical quality of delivered systems and products; Assistance to Systems Users - Provide support in planning for and transition to new, updated, and/or modified technologies, systems, and related programs; and Scientific Applications - Provide assistance in meeting existing or emerging technological challenges to satisfy mission goals and objectives. Interested Contractors are invited to identify their interest and technical capability for the seven areas of interest listed above within 15 days following the date of publication of this notice.  Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities, conflict free credentials, and unbiased status. The Government's most critical factors in this requirement are the contractor's conflict free and unbiased credentials.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Send written responses to Melissa McAbee, DOI, NBC, Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch, P.O. Box 12924, Fort Huachuca, AZ  85670-2924.  Send facsimile responses to 520.538.0453.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  If responses to the market survey indicate there are no other properly qualified sources, Note 22 shall apply.
(Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read: 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.)

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can develop, support, and execute a cross-site evaluation of two groups of discretionary grantees:  The Child Welfare Technical Assistance Implementation Centers (T/TA Network) and the National Child Welfare Resource Centers (NCWRCs), including the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids.  These grantees are members of Child Bureau’s Child Welfare Training and Technical Assistance Network.  The cross-site evaluation will employ a participatory and utilization-focused approach, will build on the work and evaluation findings of the existing T/TA Network and other evaluation contracts, and will include qualitative and quantitative methods.  The Contractor shall address some evaluation questions that examine the role of all T/TA Network members in the performance of the larger network, but the majority of the cross-site will focus on the performance and effectiveness of the Implementation Centers and the NCWRCs. 


By October of 2008, CB anticipates that the T/TA Network will consist of approximately 25 members.  The NCWRCs, the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids(AdoptUsKids), and the Child Welfare Technical Assistance Implementation Centers (Implementation Centers) will account for 13 of these members. The evaluation of the T/TA Network will require the management and administration of multi-phase programmatic technical assistance, data collection, analysis efforts, and written reports. CB plans to award this contract for a base period of five years, and two twelve-month option years (totaling seven years if all options are exercised).  The contract will be incrementally funded over the contract period of performance consistent with the Contractor’s responsibilities.


The information from this market research will help the Children’s Bureau (CB) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  The Children’s Bureau WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.

		
BACKGROUND

Children’s Bureau

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. Within HHS, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is the agency that is responsible for Federal programs that promote the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities. The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) administers national programs for children and youth; works with States and local communities to develop services that support and strengthen family life; seeks joint ventures with the private sector to enhance the lives of children and their families; and provides information and other assistance to parents. Many of the programs administered by ACYF focus on the needs and resources of children from low-income families; abused and neglected children; children and youth in need of foster care, permanency planning, independent living, adoption or other child welfare services; preschool children; children with disabilities; runaway and homeless youth; and children from Native American and migrant families.  
Within ACYF, the Children’s Bureau (CB) plans, manages, coordinates, and supports child abuse and neglect prevention and child welfare services programs. CB programs are designed to prevent the neglect, abuse, and exploitation of children and to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of all children, including those in foster care, available for adoption, recently adopted, abused, neglected, dependent, disabled, or homeless.  
CB programs also promote strengthening the family unit to help prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families and encourage reunifying families, when possible, if separation has occurred. State child welfare systems are designed to deliver or arrange for direct services that protect children who have suffered maltreatment, who are at risk for maltreatment, or who are under the care and placement responsibility of the State because their families are unable to care for them. These systems also focus on securing temporary living arrangements through foster care and ultimately, permanent families through reunification, relative placement, or adoption for children who are unable to return home. CB is the agency within the Federal Government that is responsible for assisting State child welfare systems by promoting continuous improvement in the delivery of child welfare services.

<DESC>THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1. THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE, NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. 

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 611310   Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools with a Size Standard of 6.5M

The Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS) is the most commonly used source of data for understanding health insurance coverage and its social and economic covariates at the state level. In addition, the American Community Survey (ACS) is a promising new data source that adds many new dimensions to the picture of the uninsured in this country by providing local level health insurance data. These data will be brand new to policy community, policy makers and media and it will be essential to have the Census Bureau ready to answer questions and provide training.
Due to burgeoning health reform efforts at the state level, the demands for credible data and effective translation of these data to the local policy context are particularly critical. States need a reliable, central resource for basic research, data dissemination and translation of the complex methodological issues underlying the CPS and the ACS. 

The CPS and ACS are the preeminent sources of data for these policy discussions because: a) CPS has been the benchmark survey for state policy analysis and evaluation of health insurance coverage for more than two decades; and b) the new ACS will begin producing health insurance coverage estimates for the country, states and local areas on a annual basis with the first data release coming in August 2009.  

The CPS has made several changes (and will be making at least one more) since 2000 that have a direct impact on rates of coverage (and could be easily misinterpreted by policy analysts, policy makers and the media as resulting form program changes.  The State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) at the University of  Minnesota School of Public Health plays an important role in keeping state health policy researchers (working for state governments and at the national level) informed about changes and how they impact their analyses.  SHADAC also examines these databases to produce research into how to improve them for state health policy research.  

Also, the CPS time series is getting more and more difficult to work with and SHADAC will work to produce and document a consistent set of time series for policy researchers. The growing complexity of the data could not have come at a worse time as these data will play a critical role in evaluating state health reform efforts that are underway in many states.

SHADAC’s role will be to help the Census Bureau revise its current CPS edit specifications, work to produce microdata fixes for time series data that can be used by the public use data user community, distribute new edited microdata through the Minnesota Population Center, consult on the development of new ACS edit specifications, perform data quality review of ACS and CPS (after new edit specifications have been run) test data, and to help develop an ACS-Medicaid enrollment test study. This work is more essential now than ever before as changes in the Census Bureau data products have to be appropriate for state level policy work and evaluation of state level health policy changes.   
THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE:  Regents of the University of Minnesota, State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC), 2900 University Avenue, Crookston MN 56716-5001

The period of performance shall be nineteen (19) months from date of award.
The government anticipates awarding a fixed price contract using FAR Part 15 Negotiated Competitive Procurement procedures. 

Interested parties may submit information in accordance with this announcement, which will be considered, within 15 days of the posting of this announcement. As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that the action may be competed. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For questions concerning this procurement please contact Natalie Y. Ellis, Contract Specialist at (301) 763-3559 or Natalie.y.ellis@census.gov

W91278-07-C-0037 with Caddell Construction Company Inc. for construction services of the Clinic Replacement addition for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC), Air Force Reserve Aerospace Medicine Flight Training (AMFT) at MacDill AFB, Florida.  This proposed contract modification is an out of scope modification to Caddell Constructions contract that was awarded in July 2007 with expected completion by December 2009. The AMFT addition (5,200 square feet of administration space) must be completed by September 2009 to meet mission training requirements resulting from the (BRAC) action to relocate the 927th squadron from Selfridge, Michigan. The AMFT addition will be supported by the HVAC, Fire protection and suppression system, and electrical system of the Clinic Replacement project. It is in the best interest of the government to modify Caddell Construction Company on-going contract (20% complete), so that the AMFT addition may be fully coordinated by the prime on-site general contractor to avoid safety issues, possible contract claims from two separate contractors, warranty support and turn over delays. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Other Than Full & Open Competition. This notice is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.

Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address), and (3) all answers to the technical/company criteria to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price quote submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>2. Each technical/company criteria below require additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>3.	The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR> <BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.

Vendor MUST provide Particulate respirators (N95) in accordance with (IAW) The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) standard to have a filtering capacity of particulate matter at 0.3 microns size.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using a literature review in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship literature to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of literature by 5:00PM EST on the 14th Calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply literature will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and the anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports masks with a face shield are fog free.  <BR>a.	This function is needed to maintain a clear field of vision for the practitioner.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>2.	(Clinician Safety) Literature supports that all masks must be adjustable to ensure a secure fit.<BR>a.	This function is needed to provide a protective barrier against blood borne pathogens.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>3.	(Clinical Comfort / Safety) Literature supports breathability for the wearer. <BR>a.	This function is needed to maintain a clinical comfort and ensuring the filtration rate is maintained.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.  <BR>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The Pacific Region (TRBO Region 12), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Hawaii, Guam, Okinawa, Japan, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Securement Devices.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of 2 years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>C.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of IV Securement Devices. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, the following items are required: <BR>"	IV Securement Device that provides catheter stabilization that preserves the integrity of the access device and prevents catheter migration and loss of access in accordance with the Intravenous Nurses Society (INS) standard for Securement and stabilization of intravenous access devices.<BR>Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Securement Devices product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and competitive product cross-reference in electronic MS Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for IV Securement Devices as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendor will provide a device which meets the Intravenous Nurses Society (INS) standard for Securement and stabilization of intravenous access devices. The standard is Infusion Nurses Standards of Practice #43: Catheter Stabilization Standards, which states catheter stabilization shall be used to preserve the integrity of the access device and to prevent catheter migration and loss of access; catheters shall be stabilized using a method that does not interfere with assessment and monitoring of access site or impede vascular circulation or delivery of prescribed therapy. This standard is met through evidenced based clinical research in which the device meets this standard. The vendor will provide documentation of the research, if requested. The rationale is to provide patient safety, avoid pain and suffering, avoid potential loss of venous access, avoid inflammatory processes at site, and to prevent IV access site infections.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR><BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 p.m. HST, on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.<BR><BR>To determine acceptability, a TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in a clinical setting, if needed. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	IV Securement device instructions for application to the skin are clear. (If any skin preparation is required, the method contains the steps. For example, user is to wipe the skin with an identified proprietary solution or 70% isopropyl alcohol, and wipe skin to ensure that skin site is dry. The method for removing the coverings or tabs on the adhesive portions of the device describe how to remove the coverings or tabs and the best method of placement of the adhesive side of the device on the skin) (to enhance staff efficiency).<BR>2.	IV Securement device instructions for removal of the device from the skin are clear. (The methods of peeling back or rolling edges of device from the skin are described. The use of any solution on the skin, for example 70% isopropyl alcohol or a proprietary adhesive remover, is stated) (to protect the patient).<BR>3.	IV Securement device holds intravenous catheter securely in place. (Intravenous catheter does not slip back and forth or side to side after being secured with device) (to protect the patient)<BR>4.	IV Securement device does not irritate patient skin. (No evidence of redness or blistering or puffiness of skin area.  No evidence of rash. No patient complaints of itching, burning or change in skin sensation at the site) (to protect the patient)<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 5:00 p.m. HST on the seventh calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>SSA's Notice of Intent to Advise Industry of SSA's Intent to Continue Usage of Specific Microsoft Products
<SOLNBR>SSA-Microsoft-FY09-CS
<RESPDATE>052008
<CONTACT>Cynthia M Spencer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109653369, Fax 4109659560, Email cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov
<DESC>In June 1996 the Social Security Administration (SSA) competitively awarded a contract to Unisys Corporation for the hardware and software required to support SSA’s new intelligent workstation and Local Area Network (LAN) environment.  Through the Unisys contract SSA acquired 108,922 licenses for Microsoft Windows Operating System software and 102,354 licenses for Microsoft’s Office Professional suite of desktop software as well as the associated Server software and Client Access Licenses (CALs).  As a result of this competitive procurement, Microsoft Windows Desktop Operating System, Microsoft  Office Professional Suite products, companion server software products (i.e., exchange Server, System Management Server, Windows Server, SQL Server and Host Integration Server), Project and Visio were officially established as the Agency Standard for SSA desktop and LAN software.  Since that time, SSA has competitively awarded a follow up contract to Softmart Government Services Incorporated to continue the hardware and software support established under the Unisys contract.  Licenses for Microsoft Windows Operating Systems have grown to 128,547 and 116,835 for Microsoft’s Office Professional suite of desktop software as well as the associated Server software and CALs.  Due to the evolving nature of Microsoft’s products and SSA’s desktop and LAN infrastructures,  this notice is to advise the industry of SSA’s intent to continue its use of Microsoft’s Windows Desktop Operating System, Office Professional Suite, companion server software products (i.e., Exchange Server, System Management Server, Windows Server, SQL Server and Host Integration Server), Project and Visio as SSA desktop and LAN software standards and add the following Microsoft products:  Microsoft’s Enterprise Client Access License Suite, Project Server, Systems Center Data Protection Manager, Desktop Optimization Pack, and Terminal Server Access License.  SSA’s business case is predicated on the fact that SSA intends to protect its $220 million plus financial investment in these competitively acquired Microsoft products.  SSA’s investment is a result of its license acquisition and maintenance and support costs over the life of the two contracts.  It should be noted that the business case does not include the costs associated with SSA’s application software dependence on the Microsoft operating software and office suite programs.  SSA has written custom application systems that invoke and interoperate with MS Office suite software and many more that will only run on Microsoft operating systems.  These two categories of applications would have to be re-developed at costs that would likely equal or exceed SSA’s investment in training.  SSA’s technical case is based on the need to optimize the administration and efficiency of its intelligent workstation and LAN environment.  The ability of SSA to continue to economically deploy, maintain and provide user support for the Microsoft products is predicated on using a standard configuration wherever possible.  This standard configuration is Microsoft’s Windows technology, for the operating system, and Office Suite Professional Suite at a common release level.  This permits the mass distribution of a desktop software image with minimal manpower for individual customization.  Similarly, it expedites system recovery and software troubleshooting.  Microsoft’s Office Professional Suite is comprised of the following major components:  Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint and Outlook.  There is a significant sharing of technology and features among these products and the Windows operating system that makes it desirable to use these products in conjunction with each other.  SSA has considerable experience with Microsoft’s Office Professional Suite, having 116,835 copies deployed.  The training and hands-on experience during this period, the document compatibility needed by current users, and documents created during this period make the continued use of Microsoft’s Office Suite the most efficient and effective technical solution.  Although certain other products claim to be compatible, each have significant deficiencies (e.g., lack of an integrated Web browser, e-mail client, and group scheduling or serious compatibility problems with Microsoft Office products).  Using any other product eliminates or greatly restricts access to all of the existing Microsoft Office legacy files.  Certain companion Microsoft products maintain similar benefits from their interoperability and compatibility with the operating system and Office Professional Suite.  Currently Microsoft’s server based products (i.e., Exchange, System Management, Windows, SQL, Host Integration, Enterprise Client Access License Suite, SharePoint Server, SharePoint Server Client Access License and Terminal Server Access License) are considered necessary companion products to the desktop suite and share this interoperability, as do the desktop and server versions of Project and Visio software and Systems Center Data Protection Manager and Desktop Optimization Pack.  
All of these Microsoft products enjoy the interoperability and compatibility advantages. Also the products have met all known SSA requirements for planning and technical drawings.  The use of the Microsoft Project and Visio products, wherever feasible, permits the interaction with the Office Professional Suite and the sharing of information among SSA users.  Systems Center Data Protection Manager interacts with SQL to allow faster more efficient database backups and restores.  Desktop Optimization Pack provides an efficient, cost effective desktop deployment and management system in support of SSA’s programmatic and business functions.  Therefore, Microsoft products are the only known products capable of satisfying SSA’s requirements.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  SSA’s investments shall be assessed when accomplishing a comparison to determine if it is in the Government’s best interest to switch to a different operating system. This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  Pricing data is not requested or required.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be assessed before a final determination is made.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information.  Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically by 3:00 p.m. ET on May 20, 2008 to Cynthia.Spencer@ssa.gov .  The size limitation for email attachments is 10 megabytes and MS Word is the Agency’s standard word processing software. Respondents should refer to SSA-Microsoft-FY09-CS.

Phase I development activities would be conducted by Sandia and funded by DARPA.  Phase II activities would be jointly funded by the industrial partner and DARPA, with the expectation that an application specific prototype to be used in performance and reliability testing would result by the end of Phase II.

Sandia seeks to identify industrial partners desiring to participate in future commercialization of the resultant technology to define potential applications as part of our proposal submission for BAA 08-15.  Deadline for responding to Sandia is May 14.  Contact:  Craig Smith, casmith@sandia.gov.

Action (e.g., release of draft RFP, release of final RFP, RFI):  Synopsis of intent to single source
Competitive or Single Source Single Source



The Transportation Security Administration intends to award a modification to contract number HSTS002-05-CPO0003, with Jupiter Corporation.  Personal Security has a need to increase the scope of the current contract for additional staffing through August 31, 2008.  TSA would not be able to employ the personnel necessary to conduct and accomplish the adjudication an additional work load of the system which has reached full capacity.   

This is a one-time requirement to meet the requirement through  August 31, 2008.  It would be infeasible at this point to compete a requirement for separate adjudication support for only this effort.  TSA is currently planning an open competition for overall adjudication support.  TSA has synopsize the requirement and its planning to release an RFP in May 2008, with a response date in June, evaluations and discussions through June, award of contract in June and a start date in July.  The anticipated value of this modification is approximately $244.983.00.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals from qualified 8 (a) firms under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code 511120 for a project entitled “Publishing, Public Affairs and Knowledge Transfer Communications Support for OCKT.”  
The mission of AHRQ is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care by using evidence to improve health care, improving health care outcomes through research, and transforming research into practice.   AHRQ principal responsibilities are to: conduct and sponsor research that develops information that can be used by decision makers in the public and private sectors; and ensure that information resulting from its research, demonstration, and evaluation activities is disseminated rapidly, widely, and in a readily usable form.  The Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) is an integral coordinator of the Agency's publishing, dissemination, and translation activities. OCKT is the organizational unit of AHRQ that is responsible for ensuring that Agency products and sponsored research are available to a wide array of customers in a variety of print and electronic formats. In support of these activities, AHRQ is soliciting for a contractor to provide writing, editing and production of Agency print and electronic tools and products that result from its research; public affairs, marketing, knowledge transfer, audience research; media interactions; and information and communication dissemination activities. On-site staff is necessary due to the immediate nature of the work, the need to interact closely with program staff throughout the Agency on a regular basis, and the need to have attendance at meetings and other quick-turnaround activities.  It is anticipated that 1 contract will be awarded for a period of 3 years with 2 one year options.  Award is expected no later than September 1, 2008.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQs website at www.ahrq.gov.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.  Since it is not known who is downloading the solicitation, a bidders list will not be available.  All responsible 8(a) firms may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about May 27, 2008, with proposals due approximately 30 days thereafter.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a full and open competition. The platinum dishes will hold radioactive specimens. The platinum dishes will utilize the Fusion Dissolution method. This method requires the use of a high purity (99.95% or better purity) reinforced bottom 75 mL ODS or ZGS standard form platinum dish with reinforced semi-round bottom. The dish shall be made out of ODS or ZGS platinum for flexibility and durability under the extreme temperature (1000&ordm;C) conditions this fusion method requires. If these requirements are not met there is the risk of the dish failing and causing the loss of the radioactive melt contaminating laboratory facilities and personnel. The platinum wire is for radionuclide electro-deposition. This method requires the use of a high purity (99.95% or better purity) 0.051 inch diameter wire. Five feet of this platinum wire is required to supply the electrodes for the twelve (12) electrode deposition units. The need for 99.95% or better purity is due to the process of electro-deposition will dissolve the wire if less than this purity causing the need for replacement and reanalysis of the samples due to heavy metal plating with the radionuclide being plated. No substitute items are allowed without prior approval and testing. Testing other equipment would not be cost effective to the government. The solicitation document and incorporate provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-25 (22 Apr 2008) &amp; Class Deviation 2005-o0001 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice 20080423 Edition.

Proposed Contractor
Lockheed Martin Desktop Solutions, Inc. (LMDS)
2700 Prosperity Avenue
Fairfax, Virginia  22031
Denise Beach
(703) 208-5038


(3) Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is to provide an instance of ECT/IQ for the NPPD by leveraging the existing DHS ECT/IQ system and its infrastructure.  This includes installation, project management, on-site support, training, and on-going maintenance support and software licensing for 250 personnel.  The IQ software allows DHS Headquarters and components to track, monitor, manage and respond to time sensitive correspondence received by public and private agencies, state and local governments, Congressmen, and Senators in a coordinated, agile and timely manner.  The software and related services is as follows:


	Description			   Quantity	Unit Price	     Total

IQ Enterprise Software		 	    50 each		
IQ Labor Support Services (845 hours)	                            1 lot		 
IQ Task User License		         	  200 each	 
IQ Outlook Add-In			    50 each 
IQ Annual Upgrade Subscription*	                            1 each	 
     (for IQ Task and Outlook Add-in)
IQ Annual Upgrade Subscription	 *	       1 each	 
*Prorated based on six (6) month period


(4)  Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, entitled “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements”. LMDS is the manufacturer and proprietary owner of the IQ software and is the only known source that can provide these additional licenses and support services.  


(5)  Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
IQ is proprietary software manufactured by LMDS and there are no authorized resellers, distributors or maintenance support providers. Currently, IQ is the predominant correspondence tracking tool chosen to track, monitor, and manage DHS’s external and internal time sensitive correspondence and ensure responses are coordinated between the agency and components and received by the remitters in a timely manner  As a result of the uniform processes for managing correspondence at DHS and its components, the procurement of a new correspondence system would create a catastrophic disruption of the agency’s correspondence response process.  


(6)  Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.   Efforts have been made to identify other sources for this requirement by synopsizing this requirement in Fedbizopps on 5/9/2008; the single government point of entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities over $25,000.  


 (7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on the availability of the software application being available under LMDS’s General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), number GS-35F-0636K and the vendors commercial product price list for products not listed on GSA schedule. 


 (8)  Description of market research.
Market research was conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.  The internet, including GSA Advantage, was searched for possible resellers/distributors/ suppliers that could provide the IQ software updates and maintenance.  Market research showed that only LMDS could provide the software, upgrades and application support.  The vendor was also contacted to request possible dealers for the IQ software; the vendor indicated that there are no others authorized to distribute their product.


(9)  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
Each component within DHS has an Executive Secretariat office that is responsible for clearance, coordination, and records management for Departmental documents.  Without the IQ software, the NPPD, OCIO would not be able to perform its DHS Executive Secretariat function effectively since any other solution would not integrate into the currently declared DHS enterprise solution (IQ) for this function.  The government would incur significant additional costs to integrate another solution with the existing The IQ annual software upgrades and subscriptions (patches) protect the system against security vulnerabilities.


(10)  A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
The only source considered for this procurement action is LMDS.  No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.


(11)  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for required supplies or services.   The agency will continue to monitor the market for other possible resellers/suppliers.  


(12)   Contracting Officer’s Certification.


I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><p>Paragraph 42 "Estimated Workload History" is hereby amended to read "Estimated Workload."
<p>Paragraph 48 "Estimated Total Calls" is heeby amended to read "Estimated Total Annual Calls"</p>
<p>Questions in response to the Solicitation and Government Answers:</p>
<p>Q 1. According to Paragraph 48, Estimated Workload, it appears that the government does not intend to order sufficient services from the BPA to require a full-time position. Is this interpretation correct?</p>
<p>A 1. In the combined synopsis solicitation paragraph 48 is an estimated annual contractor workload. This estimated workload, (689 calls), does not commit the government to this or any other particular amount of contractor workload. There is no intent, nor should any inference be made, of any attempt by the government, either to characterize this workload as an employer-employee relationship between the government and the contractor, or as part-time or full-time.</p>
<p>Q 2. For new small businesses that do not have the required Government Past Performance references, can personal professional experience performing comparable services be substituted?</p>
<p>A 2. All respondents who do meet the minimum qualifications in the solicitation will be evaluated based upon the criteria included in paragraph 2 of the combined synopsis solicitation. The requirements and evaluation criteria for past performance are as stated in the combined synopsis and solicitation and do not include a special requirement for "Government Past Performance." All qualifying past performance will be considered.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the natural gas distribution (NAICS 221210) and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Little Rock Air Force Base (AFB), Arkansas.
Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.     The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the natural gas and wastewater utility systems at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.     Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.     Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.     Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.     Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, March 13, 2008.   Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:     (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).     The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.     As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.   Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.     

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

<DESC>This is a MODIFICATION to the SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the natural gas, wastewater and water distribution systems at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas.  The base size is approximately 6,128 acres and includes 1,643 facilities with an approximate population of 190,000 people, most of which are military and their dependents.  This notice is a modification to the previous sources sought notice that the Government is adding the water system to the requirement.

The water system being privatized is described as follows:  Little Rock Air Force Base is located approximately 17 miles northeast of Little Rock, AR in the city of Jacksonville, AR.  The base covers about 6,104 acres of land.  Little Rock AFB provides operations and maintenance support for approximately 386 separate facilities.  The distribution of facility space is approximately 35 percent industrial, 32 percent other (such as MWR, medical facilities, officer/enlisted clubs, VAQ/VOQ, and AAFES facilities), and 33 percent administrative.  The Base population exceeds 12,000, including military personnel, civilian employees, and dependents.  Peak water demand is approximately 22,800 Kilo gallon (kgal) per month.  The annual water consumption is approximately 115,334 kgal.
The primary connection to the Jacksonville’s water system is from the City’s 5-million gallon (MG) storage tank that is located adjacent to the south perimeter of the Base’s area.  The low-pressure transfer pump station (Facility 2998) pumps water into the Base’s main storage reservoir.  The Base’s main storage reservoir is a 1.28 MG ground-level storage reservoir adjacent to Facility 570 (high-service pump station).  The high-service pump station (Facility 570) pumps water into the Base’s water distribution.
The water distribution system consists of approximately 43.4 miles of buried water main piping (which ranges in size from 6 to 16 inches).  Three types of piping material are used for water mains at Little Rock AFB:  approximately 80,399 Liner Feet (lf) of cast-iron pipe was installed in the 1950s, and 7,908 lf of ductile iron pipe with cement-mortar lining was installed in the 2000s.  The system has about 141,355 lf of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe in operation; PVC is the material of choice for water-line replacement.
In addition to the water mains, the water distribution system consists of approximately 9.6 miles buried service lines (which range in size from 1/2-inch service lines to 4-inch water lines).  Three types of material are used for service lines at Little Rock AFB:  approximately 1,739 lf of cast-iron piping, 1,923 lf of galvanized steel piping, and 22,703 lf of copper piping installed from the 1950s through the 2000s and are all currently in operation.
Three water-storage tanks support water storage requirements for Little Rock AFB.  One ground-level storage reservoir with a capacity of 1.28 MG (Tank 578) and two horizontal hydro-pneumatic tanks (Tanks 572 and 574), each with a storage capacity of 30,000 gallons, provide water for daily residential, industrial, and fire-fighting demands.  The three main potable water storage tanks (Tanks 572, 574, and 578) are protected with cathodic protection systems.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008.

Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2382) to Lisa Goins-Berntsen or Aleseia Saunders, no later than May 20, 2008.  Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractor or (prime).  Please specify which systems you are interested in and direct any questions or concerns to the POC listed for this action.

<DESC>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. (1) In the questions and answers released on April 18, 2008, Question No. 138 asked "Will the concessioner be allowed to continue to use Ellis Island as a staging area for Liberty Island?" and the answer provided was, "Yes." Following release of this answer, the National Park Service has learned that Ellis Island cannot accommodate unlimited truck deliveries without impairing Park operations, resources and values. Therefore, the answer to Question No. 138 is hereby changed to read: Yes, the Concessioner will be allowed to continue to use Ellis Island as a staging area for Liberty Island. However, the Park may limit the number of trucks allowed to make deliveries to Ellis Island. Such limitations will only be implemented if required to protect Park operations, resources or values. The NPS expects that consolidated deliveries to Ellis Island for the single Concessioner under the Contract will be more efficient than current independent deliveries for the two separate Existing Concessioners. We invite proposals for consolidating shipments to minimize truck deliveries to Ellis Island (see the Proposal Package, Principle Selection Factor 2b(6) and Secondary Selection Factor 2 (2)). Note that 2,417 trucks made deliveries to Ellis Island in federal fiscal year 2007 for the Existing Concessioner on that Island. The number of trucks per day, week and month has varied greatly depending on the season and special event operations. The Existing Concessioner on Liberty Island began using Ellis Island as a staging area for freight in 2008. The Park documented the following monthly truck deliveries to Ellis Island for both Existing Concessioners: January 2008 - 322; February 2008 - 299; March 2008 - 349; April 2008 - 484. If timed to be spread out across different times during the day, preliminary indications suggest that the Park could sustain up to approximately 18-19 truck deliveries per weekday on a regular basis, including trucks related to park operations and special events. The National Park Service has determined that this expansion of the answer to Question No. 138 is not a significant change and does not warrant an extension of the current submission date for proposals in response to Solicitation STLI004-08. Please see a copy of a request for extension and the response from the National Park Service provided on the National Park Service Concession website, http://www.concessions.nps.gov/prospectus.cfm. (2) It has come to the attention of the NPS that there are two minor flaws in the Excel spreadsheets provided in Appendix I to the prospectus. On the "Cash Flow" sheet, the formula in the row "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" does not automatically add values from the row for "Adjustment to Reconcile Cash Flow;" offerors should make sure any such values are added. On the "Income Statement" sheet, there is no row for "Event Planning and Management" under "Total Gross Revenue, Cost of Sales;" offerors may add a row for this or use the row for "other." (3) Offerors who choose to hand-deliver proposals to the address stated in the prospectus should check with building security upon arrival for directions to the correct National Park Service office. Deliverers of large boxes that might not fit through airport-style screening machines should proceed directly to and contact the security post at the rear of the building (enter from 2nd Street). Hand-deliveries of large boxes on May 19, 2008, should allow extra time for security screening to assure successful delivery to the National Park Service prior to 4:00 pm EDT.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to PR-R4-08-10120 is to answer questions received between the issuance of Amendment 1 and 5/9/08.   Note Q followed by a number denotes the number of each question and A followed by a number denotes the answer to that question.
Q1.  Can we include a Program (contract) as one project in section F and also include a specific assignment or site under that program as another project?  A1.  That is a company decision.  We have no objection to a company doing that.  We are looking for a total not to exceed 10 projects.  Q2.  Are the goals for small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, HUB zones, and service disabled veteran owned small business included in the overall small business goal or are all the small business contracting goals additive?   A2.  The goals are not additive.   The sub-goals for disadvantaged, woman-owned, etc. are all subsets of the small business goal.
This amendment also changes the form and criteria to be used to rate factor 3, past performance.  We will be using the categories from the Architect and Engineer Contractor Performance Report used in the Contractor Performance system.  The major factors in this form are the following: pre-design/planning phase, concept design phase, design development phase, construction documents phase, and construction administration phase.  Firms may contact the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist to obtain a copy of the form if desired.

<DESC>The goal of this DHS Science & Technology research program is to develop algorithms and/or analytical tools that will assist investigators of bioterrorism events by providing precision and statistical power to inferences concerning the degree of relatedness among organisms or samples used in a bioterrorist event.  The focus of this effort will be on research in the areas microbial ecology, population dynamics, host-pathogen interaction. genetic stability, statistical inference, and match criteria for the following select agents:  Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Clostridium botulinum, Francisella tularensis, Brucella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei.  The objectives include:
1.  Improving our understanding of the population genetics of these pathogens to include research on genome stability, host preferences and interactions, genetic mobility of virulence factors, polymorphic sites, mutational hot spots, geographical distribution, microbial ecology, pathogen lifecycles, natural reservoirs, effects of host - pathogen interaction, etc.
2.  Improving methods for determining rates of mutation and recombination of the pathogen genomes and the identification of adaptive mutations that can have forensic utility
3.  Establishing match criteria for discriminating "difference" or "sameness" in sample comparisons. Define the parameters for inclusion or exclusion in the context of a known sample and questioned sample.  This must be backed by statistical parameters for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis
4.  Developing  efficient, economical, and statistically rigorous sampling strategies to acquire spatially referenced genetic information on reservoirs of these pathogens
5.  Developing bioinformatics-based analytical tools for supporting hypotheses testing regarding pathogen origin that go beyond current phylogeny-based inferential methods and can meet forensic (legal) admissibility requirements of relevance and reliability.

Multiple awards are anticipated under this BAA.  This BAA has a registration process -- please see Section IV of the BAA.  Prospective Offerors must ensure that they allow sufficient time to complete the registration and submission process.


**Due to the current maintenance and unavailability of the HSARPABAA.com site, please submit white papers in accordance with the established deadline of 4:30 pm (Local Eastern Time) Monday, May 19, 2008 to the following email address:  baa08-04@dhs.gov.

The plans and specifications are going to be issued electronically through secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).   FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an E-Gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.   You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled Register with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink.     At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:     (Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company’s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to register to receive notification of upload the RFP at this site and register on the Interested Vendor List (IVL).

<DESC>As a result of questions and answers from the A-E Industry Day held 18 April 2008, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the synopsis are changed as shown.  The changed portions are shown in ALL CAPS.  For additional information, visit our website at: http://www.tac.usace.army.mil/Contracting/ae-industryday.html.  Please note that the date and time for receipt of submissions has not changed; it remains not later than 2:30 p.m. USA Eastern Daylight Time on 16 May 2008.<BR><BR>3. Selection Criteria: This acquisition is for architect-engineer (A-E) services, and is procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit: (1) a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, Parts I and II, and (2) any requested supplemental data to the procurement office shown. Firms registering for consideration for future Federal A-E projects are encouraged to electronically submit SF 330 Part II, General Qualifications, to https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx, and to update at least annually. Firms with a SF 330 Part II on file in this central Federal database do not need to submit a Part II for this acquisition unless directed by the announcement. Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise or other requirements listed. Following an evaluation of the qualifications and performance data submitted, three or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation. Selection of firms for negotiation shall be made in order of preference based on the demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance in accordance with the specific selection criteria listed in the announcement.<BR><BR>The selection criteria for this solicitation are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria a through h are primary. Criteria i and j are secondary and will only be used as a 'tie-breaker' among firms that are essentially technically equal. Criteria a through h are: (a) The firm's current specialized experience and technical competence relative to the design services required under this announcement, i.e., knowledge of design of building envelopes, systems or facilities similar to those listed in paragraph 2 (Project Information), above. Please note that firms must possess current experience and technical competence in the following Experience Categories in order to be considered for award: A05, A06, H07, S05 and T04. In addition, more emphasis shall be placed on a firms specialized experience and technical competence that relates to the remaining primary facility designs noted above; (b) The evaluation will consider the qualifications, availability and length of services of the firm's key U.S. Licensed or Registered Professional personnel in the following disciplines: project management (architect or engineer) (Function Code 48), quality control (15), architecture (06), civil engineering (12), cost engineering (18), electrical engineering (21), environmental engineering (23), fire protection engineer (25), foundation/geotechnical engineer (27), mechanical engineering (42), and structural engineering (57) in the design of facilities or systems similar to those listed in paragraph 2 (Project Information), above. Again, more emphasis shall be placed on personnel who have qualifications that support design actions for the primary facility designs noted; (c) Firms should demonstrate that they have the ability to successfully perform $20 million dollars of design and construction management support services per year for a five year period through self-performance, via a joint venture or partnership relationship, or with the assistance of subcontractors. Firms with greater capacity shall be given more consideration in the selection process. In addition, firms with greater numbers of employees within the Function Codes listed above shall also be rated higher in the selection process. Firms who possess employees in the majority or all of the codes listed will also be rated higher. HOWEVER, IT IS EACH FIRMS RESPONSIBILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE EMPLOYEES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS CONTRACT. OFFERORS WHO FAIL TO DEMONSTRATE THIS WILL NOT BE RATED AS HIGHLY AS FIRMS THAT DO.  (d) Experience in TAC's AOR, with emphasis on the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf States, will be rated higher than experience only in the United States or other areas of the world. (e) The firm's Design Quality Management Plan (DQMP) for this solicitation (not longer than five pages) will be evaluated along with the clarity and conciseness of the material presented in response to this solicitation. The evaluation will consider the management capability, approach, coordination of disciplines and subcontractors for each major work breakdown item; (f) The Government will evaluate the management capability of each firm to establish its ability to mobilize a construction management/quality assurance workforce to multiple field sites simultaneously and accomplish the assigned work in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. Of particular interest will be the firm's ability to supply the required personnel resources within expedited time periods and for potential long durations. In the evaluation of this factor, the Government will consider information concerning management and execution plans, staffing plans, and subcontracting capabilities, including the use of local labor and subcontractors. This information should be included in Section H of the Standard Form 330. Typical Function Codes required for this aspect are Project Manager (48), Construction Inspector (15), Cost Engineer/Estimator (18), Geodetic Surveyor (28), Planner (47), Safety (51), Scheduler (53) and Specifications Writer (56), Office Engineer (no code) and Project Engineer (no code).  (g) ACASS and other available past performance information on DOD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be used to evaluate past performance; (h) Experience in using MicroStation, AutoCADD, BIM, MCACES, Corps Guide Specifications and Primavera will be considered. Experience in and knowledge of U.S. Government contracting and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers construction management and quality assurance procedures are desired. The following secondary criteria will only be used as 'tiebreakers' among technically equal firms; (i) Extent of participation of small businesses (including women-owned), small disadvantaged businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort; (j) Volume of DOD contract awards in the last 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. <BR><BR>4. Submission Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit two copies of Standard Form 330 Part I (6/2004 Edition) and TWO copies of Standard Form 330 Part II (6/2004 Edition).  AS A MINIMUM, EACH A-E FIRM SHOULD SUBMIT AN ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS FORM (PART II) FOR ITSELF. SEPARATE FORMS MAY BE SUBMITTED FOR BRANCH OFFICES THAT ARE PART OF YOUR TEAM STRUCTURE, PROVIDING THESE RESOURCES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS CONTRACT. SIMILARLY, SEPARATE FORMS WILL BE ACCEPTABLE FROM JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS PROVIDING THAT THE RESOURCES LISTED WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. Send this information to:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Programs Center, Attention: Vicki F. Shepherd/CETAC-CT-A, 201 Prince Frederick Drive, Winchester, VA 22602 OR P.O. Box 2250, Winchester, VA 22604-1450, not later than 2:30 p.m. USA Eastern Daylight Time on 16 May 2008.

Technical Capability:  Resource capacity of firm to provide required services and required equipmenta.	Professional and management capacityb.	Knowledge of Federal, State and local laws and regulations governing the performance of the contract requirements.2.  Past Performancea.	This factor will indicate successful performance and ability to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.  Offerors are required to furnish the following information:b.	State the number of years that the offeror's firm has provided same or similar services as those required in solicitation  c.	Identify three (3) VA or other Federal, State or Local Government customers for whom the offeror has provided same or similar types of services described in this solicitation within the past three-(3) years.d.	If three (3) or less have not been contracted, submit commercial customers within the past three (3) years, making a total of three (3) references.  e.	Briefly describe the services provided to the customer, service periods, approximate annual dollar value of the services provided, and information on problems encountered, if any, and the offeror's corrective actions.  f.	Indicate the name, voice and facsimile telephone numbers, and electronic mail address of at least one point of contact at each reference listed.  This individual will be contacted to provide performance evaluations such as the compliance with schedules, training and skill levels of personnel accomplishing the work, responsiveness to customer requirements, effectiveness at identifying and correcting problems and overall satisfaction with service performance.  g.	In addition to references identified by the offeror, the Government may use other sources in evaluating the offeror's overall past performance record.3.  Offerors shall provide pricing as requested on Schedule of Supplies/Services a.	Unit prices for the base year and each option year will be used to calculate the offeror's total price.The evaluation factors are arranged in descending order of relative importance.  Award will be made on the basis of the combined ratings of the non-cost factors with the best-valued price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards of non-cost factors, which will be most advantageous to the Government.Technical, and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).     (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.(End of Provision)

<DESC><p>The Valles Caldera Trust (VCT) is seeking bids for field monitoring studies on fish assemblages in the streams of the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP), Sandoval County, New Mexico. This project is part of a long-term monitoring program for both trout fisheries and for native non-game fish populations. The fish populations on the Preserve are important components of the revenue necessary to reach such self sufficiency. The data from this project will inform the Trust as to the condition of the VCNP trout fisheries and native fish communities, along with estimates of fish productivity. The data collected will then be used in planning for recreational fishing to ensure the preservation and sustainable use of the fishery.</p>
