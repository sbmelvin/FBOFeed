<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 442-11-111  - "Energy Improvements Phase 2" at the Cheyenne VA Medical Center, Cheyenne Wyoming.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. The VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to evaluate the HVAC systems for the B Wing and the old surgery area, evaluate adding attic insulation in buildings 1 and 1C, as well as the potential for replacing existing VA Medical Center parking lot and exterior lighting with solar powered lighting.  The HVAC for B Wing and the old surgery area are currently using 100% outside air. This is no longer required by code and VA policies. Significant energy savings as well as increased control of humidity can be obtained by utilizing recirculated air with fresh air makeup.  The AE firm will investigate and evaluate these requirements and deficiencies and prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The AE firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied by VAMC Cheyenne fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The AE firm will also verify and correct drawings representing this work as necessary. Where current VA drawings are accurate and correct, the VA drawing will be annotated as such by the AE.  This work will be performed while the VA Medical Center is operating. Work must be planned and scheduled such to minimize the impact of these improvements and work on the ongoing operation of the medical center. This may require contractors to perform some work at night and on weekends.  Microsoft Project will be used by both the AE and contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC. The project schedule file will be sent within 1 week of project initiation and updated weekly with any changes. These will be sent to the project COTR.  An independent commissioning agent will be retained or contracted out to coordinate and handle commissioning of the HVAC portions of the project. A separate SOW and RFP will be prepared the commissioning.  The AE firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.  The AE firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied by the Cheyenne VAMC fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.   Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COTR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.   All work must be designed within the government's  construction cost range.  Buildings are considered historic and AE will be required to coordinate with the state historical society.  The AE will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The AE will provide 4 sets of documents at each submission including a cost estimate and will provide a set of AutoCAD drawings and specs in Microsoft Word at the final submission.  The AE will provide 10 sets of the final drawings and specifications for the procurement.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330, this code is a general idea of where this project may fall and not necessarily a classification of the project.  All interested parties who meet the solicitation criteria for submitting a quote are encouraged to do so.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search.

<SOLNBR>AG-3198-S-11-0002
<CONTACT>Ty Sar, Contract Specialist, Phone 7036054422, Email ty.sar@fns.usda.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a competitive procurement for The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Vendor Management Study. WIC provides recipients with vouchers for use at authorized stores referred to as vendors. Vendors consist mostly of grocery stores and pharmacies that have signed agreements to follow program rules. About every seven years, FNS conducts a nationally representative study to determine the extent at which vendors charge accurate prices to WIC shoppers, and how they adhere to program rules. In compliance with the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA), Federal Agencies are required to derive national estimates of improper payments in their respective programs. Information from this study is used to estimate improper payments to WIC vendors. Similar previous studies were conducted in 1991, 1998, and 2005. The 2011 study will replicate the 2005 study with the additions of estimations of erroneous payments attributable to cash value vouchers and WIC EBT transactions. <br />The study would achieve the following:<br /><br />i. Describe the characteristics of WIC vendors;<br />ii. Conduct covert compliance buys among a nationally representative sample of WIC vendors;<br />iii. Estimate the frequency and dollars lost to vendor violations (including overcharging, substitutions, and administrative violations);<br />iv. Examine the relationship between vendor characteristics and violations; and<br />v. Compare estimates from this study with estimates from earlier studies.
<p>The contract is to be firm-fixed price. The Base year of the contract is 2011 with a completion schedule date in July 2013.<br />This requirement will be solicited under full and open competition. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on February 2010, with offers due approximately thirty (30) days after. No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued. The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov. <br />Offerors should register at the FBO website to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as required by FAR 4.1102, will apply to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The USPS fiscal year (FY) runs October through September.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Due to the fact that any individual requirement may vary in terms of the type of work sought, an "Ordering Agreement" will be set up with various qualified suppliers. The Ordering Agreement has qualified the awarded firm for future opportunities to be evaluated for best value on a case-by-case basis after which individual Task Orders will be issued.</p>
<p>The Task Order best value evaluation process may include, but may not be limited to, the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>* Technical Plan and Approach<br />* Technical Begin / End Schedule of task <br />* Quality process<br />* Competency of resource<br />* Qualifications to perform the task<br />* Availability in accordance with need<br />* Comparative/competitive pricing</p>
<p>As an individual task is defined, as to the type of services needed, location, duration, immediacy, etc.; each of the qualified firms that have been awarded an Ordering Agreement may be contacted for the determination of best value for each individual task. The firm which is evaluated as best value will then be issued a Task Order for only that defined task. It is anticipated that all Task Orders will be issued on a firm-fixed price basis using the labor classifications and rates previously agreed for the build-up of the total amount. If any travel or travel related expenses are necessary it would be compensated on a cost-reimbursable basis in accordance with USPS Handbook F-15.</p>

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br />88 CONS H-002, Delivery Procedures Commercial Vehicles<br />All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation. Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: <br />1. Step van/panel truck <br />2. Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo<br />3. Tanker trucks <br />4. Box trucks<br />5. Tour buses <br />6. Garbage/recycled waste trucks<br />7. Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks<br />8. Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker <br />This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.<br />The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:<br />1. If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG. To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers' names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base. This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time. If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours. All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector. The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B. If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access. <br />2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base. After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B. The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG. To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery. The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.<br />Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.) Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE AND REQUEST:The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) John F. Kennedy Space Center(KSC) is seeking to identify potential industry interest in, and proposed uses for some,agency real property assets located at KSC in Florida. This announcement describes NASAassets that are currently or will soon become underutilized as a result of the transitionfrom the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) to the future mission activities authorized byCongress in the NASA Authorization Act of 2010.KSC also seeks through this announcement to ensure broad awareness and visibility of theanticipated opportunities for Public-Private and Public-Public Ventures (PPV) betweenNASA and industry or non-federal public entities.  Such ventures are defined aspartnering tools in NASAs Real Property Management Program to leverage underutilizedAgency real property to maximize utilization and efficiency. NASA may use a PPV to granta partner an interest in real property for a specified term through an instrument such asa lease, a use permit, or other form of legal agreement authorized by the NASA Space Actof 1958 and the Commercial Space Launch Act.  In addition to PPV agreements, NASA maypursue other approaches, as described in this announcement, to enable others to usefacilities for which KSC has a current or future need to support NASAs mission. It is NASAs intent to ensure fairness to all parties and to ensure best value to theGovernment in granting use of NASA facilities in a manner that optimizes its support forthe agencys missions and objectives, and the U.S. national space policy.To meet these purposes, NASA requests written responses to this announcement to assistKSC to achieve the following objectives:1.	Identify and document specific interest from industry and non-federal publicentities in pursuing a real estate agreement with NASA for use of KSC facilitiesidentified in this announcement.2.	Assess the extent of overall interest by industry and non-federal public entitiesin using underutilized NASA assets on KSC to engage in activities supportive of NASAsmissions and purpose.3.	Provide data to support KSCs planning for federal spaceport infrastructure andfacility utilization.4.	Enable determination of how underutilized capacity at KSC may be made availablein a fair and responsive fashion to industry and/or non-federal public entities toadvance agency and national objectives.KSC is continuing to assess and identify, in cooperation with the cognizant NASA programoffices and mission directorates, which KSC assets are required to meet existing andfuture agency requirements.  Therefore, facilities identified in this announcement thatare anticipated to be partially or fully available for other users may subsequently bedeemed by NASA as unavailable due to the agencys own facility needs. The Government will apply selection criteria and make facilities and other assetsavailable only if deemed in the Governments best interests.  NASA reserves the right toproceed with development and negotiation of one or more proposed PPVs or other partneringand facility utilization agreements with respondents to this announcement, withoutfurther notice, if it determines that it has met the purposes, intent, and objectivesidentified in this announcement.NASA is not precluded from entering into real estate agreements with other federalentities for use of KSC facilities identified in this Notice of Availability regardlessof expressions of interest and proposed use that may be received from industry ornon-federal public entities pursuant to this announcement.NASA will be under no obligation to proceed with any PPVs or any other partneringarrangements with regard to the anticipated availability of underutilized facilities atKSC.  In lieu of using a PPV to grant a partner a real property interest through a lease orother instrument, NASA may employ Space Act authorities to allow use of facilities forspecified purposes without granting the user any real property interest.  For example,KSC may take such an approach on a facility operated by KSC for both NASA and non-NASAusers on a regular basis.If NASA determines that a facility is going to become idle with no known current orfuture NASA mission support requirement, but still of value in support of NASAs purposeand national space policy if used by others, NASA may decide to divest the agency of theasset by transfer to another federal agency, or to others through established realproperty disposition processes administered by the General Services Administration (GSA). BACKGROUND:As directed by Congress, NASA will retire the Space Shuttle Program in FY 2011 after 30years of operation.  The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directs that NASA proceed withdevelopment of a new Space Launch System that can access cis-lunar space and the regionsof space beyond low-Earth orbit.The NASA Administrator is further directed to carry out a program to prepareinfrastructure at KSC for this transition, to enhance the overall capabilities of theCenter, and reduce the long term cost of operations and maintenance while taking measuresto provide multi-vehicle support, improvements in payload processing, and partnering atKSC.  The Act also restated the commitment by Congress to the development ofcommercially-developed launch and delivery systems to the International Space Station forcrew and cargo missions.NASA is challenged as a key element of this transition to re-scope and, as appropriate,down size its infrastructure and facilities foot print to most efficiently support themissions within expected funding levels.  KSC capabilities and assets that will becomeidle or underutilized for near-term NASA requirements, may be re-purposed and used by thecommercial space industry and others in direct support of NASAs mission and purpose.	KSC seeks to strategically identify, develop, and align the Centers distinctive spacetransportation assets and capabilities with other government and commercial spacemarkets.  KSC seeks to expand partnerships, customer base, and regional economicopportunities consistent with the NASA mission.  KSC wishes to promote and enable thewidest and fullest utilization of KSC assets and facilities to advance the nations goalsfor space exploration and development and maximize the nations investment in the federalspaceport.  These efforts are targeted to enhance space launch and processinginfrastructure and capabilities available to both the commercial and government launchand space services industry.PRIORITY USES FOR AVAILABLE FACILITIES:For the facilities identified in this announcement, NASA intends to give priorityconsideration to prospective uses and users for available facilities which align with thefollowing:	Entities which operate or directly support space launch or space user missionsfor the U.S. Government at Kennedy Space Center or Cape Canaveral Air Force Station;	Entities which operate or directly support commercial space launch or commercialspace user missions, whether or not the U.S. Government is a customerNASA will consider other technical, operationally-compatible uses and users which aredetermined to directly or indirectly support its missions and purposes if underutilizedcapacity remains available.USES THAT NASA WILL NOT CONSIDER:For the facilities identified in this announcement, that may be available for potentialPPVs or other partnering arrangements, NASA will not at this time consider responsesthat:	Fail to show any relevance to NASAs mission or purpose and U.S. Governmentinterests, or fail to demonstrate a need for use of the requested KSC asset that cannotbe met more appropriately at other locations outside the restricted area or off Center;	Are deemed incompatible with the current KSC Master Plan, land use policies,environmental conditions, or pose a negative impact on NASAs mission;	Request any proposed transfer of title to land, proposed residential uses, orproposed operation of commercial agricultural uses;GOVERNMENT's RIGHT TO APPLY CRITERIA:  NASA reserves the right to apply criteria for assessing the best fit for alternativeuses and users which may be considered for the facilities identified in thisannouncement.

The FSPTCA gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco-product advertising, labeling, marketing, constituents, ingredients and additives in the United States. These regulatory changes are expected to influence tobacco-product risk perceptions, use patterns, and exposures, and to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality over time. The study initially will focus on designing the sample, establishing the cohort, collecting data on a yearly basis, developing a database, arranging a central specimen repository, and measuring and reporting on the near-term behavioral and health effects of the regulatory changes. NIDA anticipates that over time, the study will involve continued cohort monitoring, additional recruitment of young adults to the cohort at each wave, cross-sectional analyses within age groups and longitudinal data analysis, including analysis of distal outcomes, and small area estimation modeling. Results from this study are expected to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of tobacco-product regulations in the United States (For detailed information on FSPTCA, see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ031.111.pdf).

The contractor will be required to prepare a final report, documenting pretreatment and post treatment condition; the cleaning methods for each petroglyph will be recorded in the report. The Government desires that none of the petroglyphs be damaged by harsh or intrusive cleaning- the cleaning process must not harm the rock art or cause additional damage.  All cleaning equipment must be provided by the contractor. After cleaning the petroglyphs the contractor will oversee the moving of the petroglyphs from their storing and cleaning area to their display location. (Cleaning and moving may be scheduled at different times during FY 2011.)

Bidders should demonstrate a working, positive relationship with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation; the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation; the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; and the Nez Perce Tribe.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NNA11MCOATLThis RFI is a market survey for information to be used for planning purposes only.  NASAintends to Relocate  the SOFIA Mirror Coating System from NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)in Moffett Field, CA to the Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility (DAOF)	in Palmdale, CA. The NAICS code planned for this procurement is 488991; the small business size standardis $25.5 million dollars.  The schedule, method of solicitation, type of contract, setaside potential, selection criteria, pricing structure, and other considerations dependon the responses received from this RFI.Background: The Stratospheric for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is an airborne observatorythat will study the universe in the infrared spectrum.	It consists of a Boeing 747SPaircraft modified to accommodate a 2.5 meter reflecting telescope. The Mirror Coater andrelated ground support equipment (GSE) at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CAare used for aluminization and re-coating of the SOFIA Telescope Mirror.  With aninternal diameter of approximately 4 m, the Mirror Coater is significantly larger thanthe Primary Mirror because the optic remains attached to the carbon fiber reinforcedpolymer (CFRP) mirror cell and outer structure during coating operations.  The MirrorCoating System, consisting of the Mirror Coater and GSE, is intended to be moved andinstalled at the Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility (DAOF) in Palmdale, CA, dependentupon program schedules and how soon the mirror must be recoated again.	A new facilityhas been constructed at the DAOF location in Palmdale to house this system. The purpose of this RFI is to request information from industry on potential schedulingand costs to move this system and associated hardware.	Additionally, NASA is conductingthis market research to determine industry capabilities to perform this work. Specifically, the Government is requesting information on a plan to move the SOFIA MirrorCoater, inclusive of pre-move assessments, documentation, and inspections, systempreparation, dismantling, transportation, reassembly, and test and associated costs andtimeliness.  Part of the move preparation will need to include documentation of the ~200as-built electrical lines (both signal and power) between the Power Cabinet and theControl Cabinet.  The move will also entail design, manufacture, and installation of thevacuum pump and exhaust lines for all the pumping subsystems; hookup to facility power;and design, manufacture, and installation of fluid cryogen plumbing.  The Government isrequesting recommendations on what equipment must be dismantled or disassembled andpackaged for shipment as well as concern or risk areas to be specifically managed for themove.An important SOFIA program level constraint is that the move schedule will need toaccommodate a decision as to re-coat of the mirror in October, 2011 or wait until latespring, 2012.  This decision will be made in June, 2011.  The Government requestsinformation from the vendor as to the ability of the vendor to begin the move immediatelyafter a contract is in place or to delay by up to 5 months to wait for the re-coating ofthe mirror to occur prior to the move.The following information is attached with this RFI to better define this requirement:System Description and detailed component listing  Attachment1Technical Drawings of the system in existing location  Attachment1Technical Drawings of the new facility  Attachment1Photographs of the system in its existing location  Attachment 2 and Attachment 3Responses to this RFI must include the minimum following information:  Company name,address, contractual and technical points of contact, phone number, e-mail, and website(if applicable), number of years in business, and name of parent company if applicable. Also required is information about the vendors business size (i.e., large, small, smalldisadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran owned, etc.) andwhich industries does the vendor identify itself with in the North American IndustryClassification System (NAICS).	 Interested contractors may wish to provide a descriptionof previous similar work performed, or any other information and capabilities that wouldbe pertinent to this acquisition, including what portion(s) of the work would besubcontracted.	If known, identify the anticipated subcontractors, and their contributionto the effort.	Detailed requirements for the acquisition have not been finalized, nor have the specificsfor the acquisition strategy been determined.  NASA intends to use the results of itsmarket research to aid in the making of these final decisions.	The objectives of thisRFI are: to provide industry with preliminary information regarding this potentialacquisition, solicit information about potential sources and cost/schedule estimates, toidentify the capabilities of small business and other business classifications to performthe work, to  invite potential offerors to submit comments regarding the Government'sacquisition approach, and to notify industry of the Government's intent to conductone-on-one discussions with potential offerors.This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subjectto FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for PlanningPurposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it is not to be construedas a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government payfor the information submitted in response to this request.  This procurement is subjectto review or cancellation at any time.	This notice and any concerning the SOFIA MirrorCoater move procurement that will be furnished at this time. attachments posted,constitutes all information Responses to this RFI are due  by 4:30 PM Pacific Time on Tuesday, February 15, 2011.

<CONTACT>Matthew Healey, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022458459, Email matthew.healey@ed.gov - Gary L. Weaver, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)245-6138, Email Gary.Weaver@ed.gov
<DESC>RFI Purpose:<br /><br />The Department of Education is issuing this request for information (RFI) in an effort to conduct market research for potential sources that may have the technical capability to meet its requirements and develop and provide potential solutions for managed print services. The goal of the RFI is to ascertain the level of interest and availability of potential vendors seeking to provide managed print services and obtain additional information regarding managed services options and best practices. For this purpose, managed services include printing, copying, faxing, scanning and digital sending. <br /><br />Important Note:<br /><br />This is a request for information (RFI) only. This RFI is issued as market research, solely for information and planning purposes. It shall not be considered as an invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products or services. Any response to this RFI is purely voluntary and will be treated as information only. The government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. The information provided may be used by the Department of Education in developing its acquisition strategy and the related statement of work, statement of objectives or performance specifications. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued<br /><br />Background: <br /><br />The Department of Education must develop a long-term strategy for Department-wide managed print services, to include secure scanning and digital sending, network and desktop printing, copying and faxing. It is anticipated that the Department's needs will be met through a combination of single and multifunction devices. The Department currently has 5,600 users and, in addition to the network devices, has approximately 800 desktop printers deployed. Managed print services for networked and desktop devices are required at the Department's multiple Washington, DC offices as well as all regional locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico. The Department currently acquires managed print services under a Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated model. Under this model, the Department does not own the printer services-related assets; they are instead owned and managed by a support contractor. A majority of the printers currently deployed are approximately two years old, and few, if any, are older than four years old. Copiers and other devices have a broader age range, with some being older than four years old. The Department is currently considering alternate approaches for managed print services and its intent under this RFI is to develop a better understanding of the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best managed print services solution. The goal is to determine the most desirable and logical approach for moving forward in a way that enables the Department to enjoy a modern and robust printing environment that supports optimization from technical, financial, security and environmental perspectives. Industry feedback is vitally important and the government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.
<p>Information Being Requested:<br /><br />Responses to this RFI will help shape the government's strategy for managed print services, as well as any subsequent formalized requests for proposal. The information provided in response to this RFI should include the following:<br /><br />1) Company Profile/Information<br /><br />a) Brief company profile, to include company name, address, website and point of contact name, telephone number and email address. <br />b) Indication of the company's size status; namely whether the company is a small business and/or small, disadvantaged business. <br />c) Brief summary of the organization's experience with and capability of providing both network and non-network managed print services to approximately 5,600 users located at various sites throughout the country. <br />d) Brief summary of the organization's specific experience providing both network and non-network managed print services to government agencies.<br />e) Whether the company is hardware independent.<br />f) The hardware vendor(s) for which your organization is a certified partner or provider, if any. Should also list any related certification level(s) achieved.<br />g) Whether the organization has previously provided managed print services under a Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (CO-CO) model. If so, please provide a list of the Agencies and/or businesses to which these services were provided.<br />h) List of organizations to which your company has previously provided managed print services under a Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (CO-CO) or cloud computing model. <br /><br />2) Hardware Approach<br /><br />a) Recommended approach for identifying printer models to be deployed and updating the models over time. <br />i) Whether printer models should be uniform throughout the Department.<br />ii) Strategy for minimizing life cycle costs.<br />b) Recommended refresh cycle for each of the following: network and desktop black &amp; white and color printers, copiers, scanners, fax machines, and multifunction devices.<br />c) Your organization's inventory strategy and approach for ensuring necessary replacements and deployments are timely.<br />d) Recommended average ratios for the following: users per network printer, users per network copier, users per network scanner, users per fax machine and users per multifunction device.<br />e) Recommended maximum distance from a user to each type of networked device.<br />f) The Asset Management tool(s) that your organization utilizes and/or recommends.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is undertaking a new program to develop new applications, devices, products, business solutions, and a range of services that improve transportation's role in safety and quality of life. <br /><br />America's transportation system is among the best in the world, but Americans face crash risks, congestion, environmental impacts, and other detriments that erode our quality of life. Smart ideas on how to apply advanced wireless technology can make the transportation system safer, more efficient and even "greener." <br /><br />An advanced open source wireless technology called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) allows vehicles of all kinds, whether traveling slowly or even over 60 mph, to communicate with each other, stationary roadside equipment, and mobile devices. Thus far, the majority of applications have been aimed toward crash avoidance.<br /><br />The DOT believes that there are new approaches, partnerships and devices for using DSRC that innovators among the broader public can and will devise, if they are called to participate. This is that invitation.<br /><strong><em><br />When vehicles talk to each other, what should they say?<br /></em></strong><br />The Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge (the "Challenge") is soliciting short descriptions of novel, implementable ideas for products or approaches that utilize DSRC to offer benefits to travelers or society at large.<br /><br />Selected prize recipients will receive funded opportunities to present their winning ideas to unleash a new breed of advanced wireless technologies to make universal vehicle connectivity a reality.<br /><br />DSRC technology and this Challenge are described in more detail below.<br /><strong><br />Understanding DSRC<br /></strong><br />DSRC is an open source protocol for wireless communication, similar in some respects to WiFi. While WiFi is used mainly for wireless Local Area Networks, DSRC is intended for highly secure, high-speed wireless communication between vehicles and the infrastructure. The key functional attributes of DSRC are:
<p>&bull; Low latency: The delays involved in opening and closing a connection are very short-on the order of 0.02 seconds.<br /><br />&bull; Limited interference: DSRC is very robust in the face of radio interference. Also, its short range (~1000 m) limits the chance of interference from distant sources. Additionally, DSRC is protected by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for transportation applications. Although purely commercial convenience applications are welcome, transportation safety applications take precedence.<br /><br />&bull; Strong performance during adverse weather conditions.<br /><br />In 2004, the FCC dedicated 75 MHz of bandwidth at 5.9 GHz to be used for vehicle safety and other mobility applications. DSRC operates in this band, and has been developed for over a decade by a range of stakeholders including automakers, electronics manufacturers, state highway departments, and the federal government. Most work on DSRC has focused on active safety-crash avoidance using driver alerts based on sophisticated sensing and vehicle communications. A number of other DSRC applications have been envisioned as well. For example:</p>
<p>&bull; Transit signal priority<br />&bull; Transit vehicle refueling management<br />&bull; Personalized taxi dispatch services<br />&bull; Integrated transportation financial transactions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Toll collection<br />&nbsp; -&nbsp;Parking payment<br />&nbsp; - Rental car payments and processing<br /><br />&bull; Enhanced truck roadside inspection<br />&bull; Real time freight logistics<br />&bull; Pedestrian safety at intersections<br />&bull; Routing and scene management for emergency services<br />&bull; Advanced highway-rail and highway-transit grade crossings</p>
<p>More information on DSRC is available at the following website: http://www.its.dot.gov/DSRC/dsrc_faq.htm</p>
<p><strong>This Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Working with our many stakeholders, the DOT aims to improve safety, mobility, and the environmental impacts of transportation. DSRC has the potential to provide dramatic benefits in these goal areas, but only when it is widely implemented in vehicles and roadside equipment. To accelerate DSRC's adoption, the DOT is seeking feasible ideas for valuable new ways to utilize DSRC. This Challenge is seeking all sorts of ideas, from anyone. Winning submissions will be short-20 double-spaced pages or less- and need not be technical. The barriers to entry are intentionally low.</p>
<p>The submissions must describe an idea for a novel use, application, device, product, service or solution that relies on DSRC. The technical, engineering details that would enable the idea do not need to be fully spelled out, although technical feasibility is an important factor in judging the submissions. Similarly, while a full business plan is not a necessary part of a winning submission, the potential for widespread adoption is also an important criterion in judging. Through this challenge, the DOT aims to develop new, actionable ideas, and to connect inventors with potential partners-businesses and investors-that might help bring the ideas to life.</p>
<p><strong>How to Enter</strong></p>
<p>1. Read the Challenge rules and eligibility requirements at the following website: <a href="http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov">http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov</a>. <br /><br />2. Prepare a description of your idea in no more than 6000 words (about 20 double-spaced pages).<br /><br />3. If desired, prepare a video or images to illustrate your idea.<br /><br />4. By May 1, 2011, submit your material through the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website: http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov. <br /><br />Please Note: Ideas must be submitted through the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website. Ideas submitted through the FedBizOpps website will not be accepted.</p>
<p>For more details, please visit the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website: http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov. The Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website contains all of the information needed to respond to this challenge.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. DELETED (Not required for recruiter site)</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - DELETED (Not required for recruiter site)</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to The University of Georgia, 953 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30602, for weekly supplies of 14 to 16 15ml bottles of fresh turkey blood certified by CDC as uncontaminated to be used in influenza surveillance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers and is called upon to provide antigenic, serological and microneutralization data for the twice yearly vaccine decision meetings and ongoing antigenic analysis. The CDC also tests samples received from throughout the world as a part of Influenza surveillance. The turkey red blood cells are an vital part of these testing processes. The antigenic and serological tests require fresh turkey red blood cells to provide accurate and consistent results. The standard method for influenza virus titration is based on the ability of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) to agglutinate red blood cells (RBC) of different species. Usually avian red blood cells, such as from turkeys are used in the hemagglutination assay. Avian RBC are small and nucleated, they settle fast and form a compact button on the bottom of the V-well microtiter plate in the absence of the virus, thus providing with clear endpoint dilution determination. The Hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) is the antigenic characterization test performed on all viruses isolated at the CDC from samples received from around the world. The serology test is an important test in epidemiological and immunological studies as well as in the evaluation of the immunogenic properties of the vaccine. This test is a sensitive method to measure antibodies against subtype- and strain-specific antigens and is the serological test most often applied to influenza viruses. Due to the uncertainty in freshness of the turkey red blood cells available commercially, the turkey red blood cells should be provided to the CDC from an local avian facility. The proximity of the facility is a tremendous asset in the event there is an immediate need for fresh turkey red blood cells, such as in the event of a outbreak or pandemic. To meet public health needs with accurate and consistent results, CDC has determined that it will be necessary to have the turkey red blood cells from a local avian facility to be used in the antigenic and serological assays. The purpose of this contract to provide the Influenza Division with twice weekly deliveries of fresh turkey red blood cells for the testing of samples received from around the world as a part of Influenza surveillance. This is an eight month purchase order to obtain turkey red blood cells from a local avian facility for the antigenic and serological testing of influenza samples as a part of worldwide surveillance. The contractor will provide the Influenza Division 14 to 16 bottles of turkey red blood cells (15ml each) from one flock of turkeys. The flock of turkeys should be pre-screened for influenza and found to be negative. The flock will be dedicated to supplying turkey red blood cells to the CDC to avoid any type of contamination. The blood will be drawn from the turkeys on Monday for delivery on Tuesday and on Wednesday for delivery on Thursday. The delivery on Monday will contain eight bottles and on Thursday six to seven bottles containing 15mls of fresh turkey red blood cells and at least 15mls of alsever's solution. The alsever's solution, a preservative, should be sterile. Independently, and not as an agent of the government, the contractor will provide all management, labor, facilities, materials (except as specified herein), supplies and equipment necessary to perform, on an as-needed basis. The delivery of 14 to 16 bottles of turkey red blood cells twice weekly to the CDC. The CDC will supply bottles for the blood if needed. The delivery on Tuesday, from the bleed on Monday, will be eight bottles containing 15mls of turkey red blood cells and alsever's. The delivery on Thursday, from the bleed on Wednesday, will be six to seven bottles containing 15mls of turkey red blood cells and alsever's. The Project Officer will communicate with the contact regarding deliveries on holidays. Each shipment should contain the band number of the turkey in which the blood was taken with the amount of blood, not including alsever's, shipped. The line listing of the contents of the package will be enclosed in the shipment. The turkeys used for this purchase order must have been pre-screened by the CDC to ensure the turkeys are influenza negative. For this contract, the CDC will only provide the glass bottles, if needed, used for the transport of red blood cells from the contractor to the CDC. References: 1. Kendal, A.P.

The Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor copies of all relevant written designations.

<p>Invoices<br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) partners with the United States Coast Guard Finance Center for financial services in support of TSA operations, including the payment of contractor invoices. Therefore, all contractor invoices must be submitted to, and will be paid by, the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center (FinCen). Invoices may be submitted via U.S. Mail, electronic mail, or facsimile. Contractors shall utilize ONLY ONE method per invoice submission. The submission information for each of the three methods is as follows: <br />(1) U.S. Mail: <br />United States Coast Guard Finance Center<br />TSA Commercial Invoices<br />P.O. Box 4111<br />Chesapeake, VA 23327-4111</p>
<p>(2) Electronic Mail: <br />Email Invoices<br />FIN-SMB-TSAInvoices@uscg.mil<br />Customer Service <br />1-757-523-6940 or 1-800-564-5504 <br />Website at www.fincen.uscg.mil <br /><br />The electronic mail address and facsimile number listed above shall be used by contractors for ORIGINAL invoice submission only. If either electronic mail or facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail. It is the responsibility of the contractor to verify that invoices are received, regardless of the method of submission used. Contractors may inquire regarding the receipt of invoices by contacting the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center via the methods listed in subparagraph (e) of this clause. Upon receipt of contractor invoices, FinCen will electronically route invoices to the appropriate TSA Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and/or Contracting Officer for review and approval. Upon approval, the TSA Contracting Officer will electronically route the invoices back to FinCen. Upon receipt of approved invoices from a TSA Contracting Officer, and the subsequent certification by an Authorized Certifying Official, FinCen will initiate payment of the invoices. Payment Status: Contractors may inquire on the payment status of an invoice by any of the following means:<br />(1) Via the internet: https://www.fincen.uscg.mil/secure/PH_menu.htm <br />Contacting the FinCen Customer Service Section via telephone at (757) 523-6940 (Voice Option #1).

<p>Preparation of Invoices<br />(a) Invoices shall include the information required in subparagraph (a)(2) of the Prompt Payment Clause, contained in this Section of the Contract, including EFT banking information, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and DUNS number. <br /><br />(b) Invoices that fail to provide the information required by the Prompt Payment Clause may be rejected by the Government and returned to the Contractor. Such rejection by the Government does not entitle the Contractor to interest payments from the date of submission of a rejected invoice. Interest payments apply only to proper invoices that are received by the Government. <br /><br />(c) Supplemental Invoice Documentation: Contractors shall submit all supplemental invoice documentation (e.g. copies of subcontractor invoices, travel vouchers, etc) necessary to approve an invoice along with the original invoice. The Contractor invoice must contain the information stated in the Prompt Payment Clause in order to be received and processed by FinCen.

<p>Initial post assignments will be based on each applicant's understanding of USAID/OFDA and the humanitarian assistance environment, each applicant's background (i.e., language, regional experience, etc.), and available post vacancies at the time of award.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team.  The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<DESC><BR>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources that are capable of producing the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Sensor Processing Group (NBCSPG), which is a mission equipment package used in the Stryker Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) to integrate the vehicle's on-board systems.  The NBCSPG plays a vital role in digitizing the NBC battlespace and provides the soldier with a set of user interfaces to command and monitor disparate NBC sensors and other reconnaissance vehicle systems.  The NBCSPG automatically integrates contamination data, time and location data, meteorological data, and data from other systems to produce NBC hazard intelligence reports.  The NBCSPG interfaces with the NBCRV Command and Control system, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2), and automates transmission of NBC reports to and from the NBC battlespace.  A Best Value, full and open competition solicitation is contemplated resulting in a single, 3 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.<BR>The NBCSPG is a collection of hardware and software that processes the information gathered by the sensors, stores it in a database, and helps crewmembers analyze the information, and send electronic reports.  Nuclear Biological Chemical Joint Reconnaissance Application Software (NBCJRAS) is the software that controls and manages the NBCSPG, meteorological, vehicle sensors and other devices.  NBCJRAS includes a Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) software application to provide connectivity to the vehicle's Command and Control (C2) program.  The C2 system for the NBCRV is FBCB2.  <BR>The description of the NBCSPG hardware items are as follows:<BR>NSN for the NBCSPG is 6665-01-537-6899, PN: 5-15-31404. The NBCSPG performance specification is EA-S-2262 and the Interface Control Document is NBCSPG-ICD-31404. <BR>The NBCSPG hardware provides the interface between sensors and crewmembers, and gives crewmembers a way to print the information about the samples collected, and send it to the NBC Operations Center.  It consists of the following components.<BR>1.  Rugged Notebook Computer Assembly to include a solid state disk drive, battery pack, and CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive module.  The rugged notebook computer assembly has a touchscreen and keyboard that allows it to function as a standalone workstation when docked in the notebook computer docking station.  There are two rugged notebook computer assemblies in the NBCSPG. NSN: 7010-01-572-5500, PN: 5-15-31435<BR>2. Notebook computer docking station assembly that provides a source of power and secure mounting for the notebook computer.  The docking station includes a port replicator panel which replicates the notebook computer's external interfaces including power.  The docking station assembly also includes a screen support to support the notebook computer screen when the vehicle is in motion; a touchscreen stylus to provide improved operator interaction with the notebook computer; and an Ethernet patch cable to ensure connectivity between the notebook computer, the docking station, and the Ethernet switch.  There are two docking stations in the NBCSPG, one at the surveyors station and one at the commander position. NSN: 7050-01-572-5490, PN: 5-15-31406.<BR>3. Rugged Keyboard with integrated touch-pad.  The keyboard is sealed to protect it from environmental or accidental damage.  The keyboard also has a backlit keypad that enables the operator to navigate the keyboard with little or no light.  NSN: 7025-01-571-7204, PN: 5-15-31414.<BR>4. Laser Printer assembly that is housed in a ruggedized case to protect the printer in harsh conditions.  NSN: 7025-01-572-7084, PN: 5-15-31467<BR>5. Meteorological Display that collects information from the meteorological sensor and the ground temperature probe.  The display routes this information to the NBCSPG interface devices via an RS-232 serial data interface.  NSN: 6660-01-572-5493, PN: 5-15-31425<BR>6. Meteorological Sensor and Weatherproof cover.  The meteorological sensor is mounted on the exterior of the NBCRV.  The sensor collects wind speed, wind direction, temperature of the surrounding air, air pressure, and relative humidity.  Sensor NSN: 6660-01-572-5494, PN: 5-15-31427.  Cover NSN: 8465-01-571-9465, PN: 5-15-31418.<BR>7. Ground Temperature Probe to measure temperature at ground level.  NSN: 4920-01-572-5496, PN: 5-15-31426.<BR>8. Ethernet Switch is a 16 port switch that provides 10/100 Mbytes auto-sensing LAN connectivity without any configuration required.  NSN: 5895-01-572-8810, PN: 5-15-31420.<BR>9. RS-232 Serial Data Interface Adapter that performs I/O processing, outputting data over a standard 10/100 Base-T Ethernet connection.  The unit provides eight serial ports.  NSN: 7021-01-572-5497, PN: 5-15-31421.<BR>10. RS-232/RS-422 Serial Data Interface Adapter that performs serial I/O processing, outputting data over a standard 10/100 Base-T Ethernet connection.  The unit provides eight serial ports.

<DESC>This amendment is incorporated to extend the closing date of the Region 5 Tent solicitation to January 26, 2011, by 1630 PST. The update of the VIPR system for VIPR release 3.2 has run into unexpected problems with the installation at the Application Hosting Enviornment (AHE). At this time we have not received a confirmation of the exact date the upgrade is anticipated to occur. Therefore, I am exercising the option to extend in hopes that 3.2 release will be completed by that date. End of Amendment.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security is pursuing a solution for an electronic counter-measure (ECM) system for both dismounted (one-man portable) and vehicular applications.
  Through this Request for Information / Source Sought, companies are encouraged to submit information about commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or non-developmental systems that are able to meet or exceed the requirements listed below.  Information on current or previous test or operational data on the systems is also of interest  a listing of such data (not actual test or operational data) should be included with submission.

The following are the (unclassified) requirements of the ECM capability.  Please provide information that demonstrates compliance with each requirement, and the specific performance measure of the proposed system.  For those parameter(s) that are not met, cite any potential associate tradeoff(s) including operational benefit to the users and/or state the basis of estimate required to bring the system into compliance with the requirements that are not met.
  A single solution system with two variants is being sought; the one-man portable system must serve as the common core of the vehicular system.  Responses are to be limited to 20 pages (letter or A4 sized) in electronic format.

System Requirements:
	Provide suppression of typical Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) initiation trigger devices at operationally significant distances
	Provide robust suppression in the presence of both nuisance and threat signals
	Protection capability across the RF threat spectrum
	Loadset programming shall provide ability to specify a variety of modulation/waveforms, frequency, timing, and power levels
	System shall be capable of maintaining internal memory of multiple loadsets which can be operator selectable without interruption of suppression
	Transmitted signals must be sufficiently narrow to provide suppression without unnecessary interference to friendly systems
	If equipped with a receiver, must provide sufficient sensitivity and bandwidth resolution to adequately discriminate and resolve threat signals
	Ability to employ user defined timing synchronization
	Option to operate at high-power to provide maximum protection, or at low power to extend operational time, selection of these two power levels is operator selectable without interruption of suppression
	While operating at high-power, the man-portable variant must provide continuous operations using only included GOTS/COTS batteries
	System shall be able to be fully operational within tactically significant timelines (time must include all steps between power-on and operation to include for example warm-up, BIT, calibration, and programming/loadset loading)
	Built-in Test (BIT) shall be sufficient to find faults and corrective information via GUI
	At a minimum, the system shall have the following modes, and must be able to transition between them at any time through operator initiation:
o	Stand-by  system is powered on, but is not transmitting
o	Operate  system is providing required protection
	The man-portable system shall be the common component for both variants with the ability to plug into the vehicular mount for added operational flexibility
	Man-portable configuration (inclusive of all equipment required to operate) must not exceed 30 lbs 
	Vehicle configuration (inclusive of all equipment except antennas) must not exceed 120 lbs 
	Must be able to be transported and monitored by existing EOD robots without interfering with normal robot operations - minimal reconfiguration to the man-portable ECM system is acceptable
	Both variants and battery chargers must be able to operate on either DC (10-28VDC) or AC power (110/220VAC at 60/50Hz)
	Internal capability to record in non-volatile memory ECM-related events with date, time, and locations
	Mean-time-between-failure must exceed 500 hours based on operational mission duration
	Capable of being operated via remote control up to 10 meters away
	System shall use modular components to permit rapid repair Provide security of the system to include provisions for both volatile and non-volatile memory
	Provide external interfaces including one gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0, and one N connection for RF distribution
	Proposed system must include software to upload and download the systems loadset as well as for download of faults and logs, and to further investigate faults
	Maintain 50% reserve capability for all processors, field-programmable gate arrays, and memory
	Design must include Human Factor Engineering (HFE) concerns including both audible and visual indicators, display panels, and controls
	ECM and RCU shall include display panels which will provide the operator all necessary information to operate the system to include mode, status, alerts, power levels, battery power, temperature and faults
	Alerts, both audible and visual must be able to be reduced in intensity or eliminated in time increments
	Compliance with all safety standards including Electrical and RF hazard mitigation
	Capable of operating in -20F to 150F and storage between -40F and 160F
	Capable of operating in environments with 0-100% humidity (non-condensing)
	Operators wearing personal protection equipment must be able to operate all controls on system as well as on remote control
	Compliance with IEC 61000 and MIL-STD 461F

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -27pt"><acronym><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></acronym></p>
<p>All work shall be performed between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm, Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, unless specifically approved or requested by the COR.</p>
<p>The services will be performed during the growing season on a cycle approved by the COR to maintain the outside area in a neat and clean manner. Policing areas to remove trash and other cleaning issues will be done by the Janitorial staff during the off season and between scheduled landscaping visits as directed by the Property Manager.</p>
<p>The "prairie" is approximately 1.3 acres of native plant and wildflower species. It is intended to offer a sustainable design which offers improved storm water management, enhanced habitat within the urban core. It promotes sustainability while requiring less watering and fewer soil amendments. The prairie has been receiving regular maintenance since its inception in 2003. We are seeking a Contractor with experience in managing native prairie sites to continue the program.</p>
<p>The prairie is primarily populated with the following native plant species:<br />&bull; Wild columbine<br />&bull; Butterfly weed<br />&bull; Heath aster<br />&bull; Sand coreopsis<br />&bull; Wild lupine<br />&bull; Black eyed Susan<br />&bull; Lillie bluestem<br />&bull; Smooth aster<br />&bull; Purple coneflower<br />&bull; Blazing star<br />&bull; Wild bergamot<br />&bull; Stiff goldenrod<br />&bull; Showy goldenrod<br />&bull; Tall coreopsis<br />&bull; Switch grass<br />&bull; Yellow coneflower<br />&bull; Indian grass<br />&bull; Downy sunflower</p>

<p>If maintenance tasks will be required between visits, the Contractor will train the current groundskeeper to do any interim maintenance required.</p>
<p>The contractor will supply all garden tools, supplies and herbicides to perform the prairie maintenance done during their visits.</p>
<p>The janitorial contractor will maintain any adjacent lawn and maintain a very neat edge where the lawn meets the prairie plants. The Native Prairie contractor will cut down, rake and clean the prairie each spring in lieu of a controlled burn.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide a written mid-summer report each year on the condition of the prairie to include:</p>

<DESC>This is a revised pre-solicitation announcement to notify the market of an upcoming solicitation whereby, the VAPHS intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract for management of a regional multi-state Durable Medical Equipment effort.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued on or about January 25, 2011.

The contractor will provide a comprehensive Durable Medical Equipment (DME) program furnishing all labor, equipment, materials and facilities necessary for pick-up, delivery, cleaning, repair and storage of beneficiary items for the authorized veterans of the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS).  The base contract period will be from March 1, 2011 through February 29, 2012, with up to four option years all subject to the availability of funds.  Offerors are advised that they are responsible for obtaining all amendments and performing in accordance with all specifications, schedules, terms and conditions of the pending solicitation.  
Contractor will transport DME and educate patients in nine (9) Pennsylvania Counties: Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland; four (4) Ohio Counties: Belmont, Columbiana, Harrison, and Jefferson; and two (2) West Virginia Counties: Hancock and Marshall.	
Minimal deliveries (20 per year) may be required to Armstrong, Mercer and Venango Counties in Pennsylvania, and Monroe, Brook counties in West Virginia.
Approximately 60% of DME transports are within Allegheny County with the remaining 40% of transports distributed among Ohio and West Virginia Counties.
As it is impossible to determine the exact quantities that will be required during the contract terms, it is estimated that the items listed below will be required each year during the contract period.  1100 Vehicle transports of DME within 15 counties listed above, 20 Vehicle transports of DME outside of 15 counties listed above, 120 Vehicle transports of DME to/from VA Pittsburgh Healthcare facilities (University Drive, Highland Drive, Heinz), 450 Installations of assistive equipment and 400 Vehicle transports to reclaimed DME.  The VA will not be held liable to order the quantities listed.  
Effort will require pick-up/delivery of equipment in the homes of beneficiaries or other designated points in accordance with standards established by The Joint Commission (TJC) or equivalent for home care. Contractor shall be TJC accredited at the servicing location prior to contract award.  The purchase of Durable Medical Equipment is "NOT" a part of the contract. 

Offers are due by February 17, 2011 and should be mailed to Philmore Crichlow, Jr. VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Contracting Office (90C-A), 1010 Delafield Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15215.
