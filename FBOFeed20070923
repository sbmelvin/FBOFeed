Sole Source for Telemetry ? Data Flow Systems (DFS)
1.	This memo is provided as sole-source acquisition justification for a project to install telemetry on Deluge Tanks and Lift Stations. The scope of the project consists of installing pressure transducers and telemetry to continuously monitor the levels.
2.	The existing system is manufactured by Data Flow Systems (DFS). In order to maintain functionality and base-wide monitoring capability, the replacement control systems must be fully intergraded and compatible with the base's Data Flow System.
3.	There is significant risk of damage to the existing base-wide system if equipment is improperly installed or configured. DFS does not sell through distributors and has its own dedicated installation teams to ensure proper installation, thereby providing any warranty coverage.
4.	The current radios in the telemetry system are made by Data Flow Systems to meet the required frequency specified by the Government and FCC. Market research of industry websites and with other installations revealed that no other company can provide a product that is either compatible or can be intergraded with the current system. The Government will continue to pursue alternative sources of supply for this critical product and service.
