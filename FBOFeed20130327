<DESC>SPARES PURCHASE PR NUMBER: FD2030-13-00293 SOLICITATION NUMBER: SPRTA1-13-R-0268 EST. SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: 12 April 2013 EST. SOLICITATION CLOSING DATE: 12 May 2013 AMC: 3P ITEM DESCRIPTION: Turbine shroud section for TF33 engine. NSN: 2840-01-160-6491 P/N: 734873 PURCHASE HISTORY: Last purchase 25 Feb 2012. Qty 45. Unit price $12,440.44. Awardee United Technologies Corp. QUANTITY:  75 DESTINATION:  SW3211 - Tinker AFB, OK 73145-8000 REQUIRED DELIVERY: 2 units monthly beginning on/before 31 Oct 2014 QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: N/A EXPORT CONTROLLED:  NO QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): United Technologies Corp./Pratt & Whitney (CAGES 52661 / 77445) In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Description: NSN 3020-00-293-5136 - SPROCKET, WHEEL. Being bought in accordance with Army (19207) drawing 8705893 and all related data. The total quantity required is 513 each with all to be shipped to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA 17070-5000.

Technical drawings/bid sets are available after the same issue date on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ then click the cFloders under the Technical Data tab. Requests should include the RFP number, opening/closing date, NSN, purchase Request Number, buyer's name and your complete name and address. FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC. This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, and past performance. The required delivery is an incremental schedule requiring 250 each to be delivered in 150 days and the balance to be delivered in amounts of 100 each every 30 days until complete. Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists, Military Handbooks, and other standardization documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP), in Philadelphia, PA. Most documents are available in Adobe PDF format from the ASSIST-Quick Search and, in most cases download the documents directly via the Internet using standard browser software. Documents not available for downloading from ASSIST can be ordered from the DODSSP using the ASSIST Shipping Wizard, after establishing a DODSSP Customer Account by following the registration procedures or by phoning the DODSSP Special Assistance Desk at (215)697-6396/6257 (DSN: 442-6396/6257).Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC>This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to prequalify suppliers for a future Request for Proposal (RFP). Only pre-qualified suppliers from this RFQ will be allowed to participate in the future RFP. <br /><br />The United States Postal Service intends to award a Design-Build Competitive Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) contract to replace and upgrade the existing HVAC system and related equipment at the USPS Curseen Morris P&amp;DC in Washington, D.C. <br /><br />The Curseen Morris facility, located at 900 Brentwood Road, NE in Washington DC, is a two-story, 693,000 square foot mail processing &amp; distribution center that was originally constructed in 1984. In 2003 the facility was contaminated by anthrax and was cleaned and renovated. Most of the HVAC equipment in the building went through a fumigation procedure of chlorine dioxide gas and high humidity, which resulted in the elimination of the anthrax threat but also caused deterioration of much of the metal components of the air handlers including casings, coils and drain pans.<br /><br />The scope of work includes, but is not limited to the installation of new chillers, cooling towers, pumps, boilers, roof top units, VAV boxes and air handling units. The project will also include the repair of air handling units that are not replaced, as well as resizing, reconfiguring, and cleaning the existing duct work. Commissioning of the system will be performed by a third party under contract with the USPS.<br /><br />The construction effort shall be scheduled in phases to include related mechanical, electrical, and minor structural upgrades required for the complete installation of this project.<br /><br />The Curseen-Morris HVAC project will provide unique challenges during the construction phase since it is an existing facility that operates 24 hours per day/7 days per week with mission critical operations and equipment and shall not, in any case, interrupt the plant operation, truck access to the plant or the loading docks. It is imperative to complete the work in an efficient and expedited manner that eliminates any risk of water penetrating the building during removal and re-installation of roof-mounted equipment.<br /><br />All work will be noted on the plans and Functional Design Specifications (FDS) issued by the Postal Service request for proposal. <br /><br />Questions can be directed to Bob Ramba at robert.c.ramba@usps.gov.<br />

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement to purchase a variety of 4H-SiC wafers in various quantities.  We intend to purchase these wafers from Cree, Inc., 4600 Silicon Dr., Durham, NC 27703. We have previously purchased wafers from this vendor on a competitive procurement and have conducted a comprehensive characterization of them.  This required many hours of work.  Therefore, we must make sure each additional purchase of the wafers is consistent with previous ones on hand.  Obtaining these wafers from any other vendor would jeopardize years of research. The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR Reference 13.106-1(b)1. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than close of business on March 28, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html Source is under the authority of FAR Reference 13.106-1(b)1.l

Satellites and airborne systems provide SAR data in various degrees of processing (from raw telemetered RADAR data to intermediate SAR data products to fully processed SAR imagery) to the SAR DAAC in support of NASA sponsored scientific applications, including oceanography, geology, glaciology, hydrology and ecology. There can be no interruption in services to the contract that expires June 30, 2013. According to FAR 6.302-3(b)(2)(ii), the use of the authority at (a)(2)(ii) is appropriate when it is necessary to:  Establish or maintain an essential capability for engineering or developmental work calling for the practical application of investigative findings and theories of a scientific or technical nature. The current sets of capabilities possessed by UAF are essential to NASA in that the combination of technological skills, scientific and theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience are necessary to operate and manage the SAR DAAC. NASA requirements include the following: 1) Support NASAs Earth Science objectives and the broad SAR user comunity by providing access (e.g. discovery, search, browse and download) to SAR data and products archived at the DAAC; 2) Provide operations support for acquiring, processing, archiving and distributing data for new and future missions; 3) Provide operations support for ingesting, archiving and distribution of PolSAR and InSAR type products, e.g. UAVSAR and AIRSAR data processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); 4) Manage the needs of the DAAC users, improve the exchange of data and information between earth scientists and SAR data users, share DAAC expertise with the user community, assist in locating and manipulating related data not archived at the DAAC, and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of new algorithms to derive SAR data and applications products; and 5) Provide support to the research and educational communities engaged in the use of SAR data products. The UAF facility is necessary because it is the only facility in the U.S. that meets the geographic requirements for the collection and processing of SAR data. The UAF ground station is located above Latitude 64N, allowing the greatest number of opportunities to acquire data (in terms of satellite passes) from the RADARSAT-1, RADARSAT-2, ERS-2 and ALOS polar orbiting spacecraft. A processing facility elsewhere would require the costly and technically difficult transmission of data from the ground station. As a result, this facility is the only facility that can meet the Governments requirements for the collection and processing of SAR data with low data latency. Many NASA investigations rely on the UAF ability to process and distribute data in near-real time (NRT).  In these instances, near real-time processing of SAR data often needs to occur so that products are available to scientists within six hours or less of collection at the sensor.  This imposes several time constraints in the process, including the time between collection at the sensor and overpass by the satellite of the ground station, the data downlink time, the time required to transmit large volumes of data to the processing facility and the actual time required to create SAR products.  All these steps are required to produce SAR products, but the total time required is not constant nor can it be fully characterized due to a number of factors. In order to mitigate latency risks due to data transmit times and allow NRT requirements to be met at a high percentage, co-location of processing with the downlink location is required.  Only the UAF can provide the near-real time capability because of their proximity to the antenna collecting sensor data directly and passing it into the SAR DAAC systems, which makes them uniquely qualified to perform the work. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than TBD Eastern Standard Time. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing via email (oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.) to Denise Sydnor at Denise.Y.Sydnor@nasa.gov not later than TBD. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. NISC has served the NIH community for over 16 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for services. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span></strong>:<br /><br />The delivery of the Titanium Kits will be made within 1-week of receiving approved purchase order.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JUSTIFICATION:</span></strong></p>
<p>The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center in conjunction with the research laboratories are using the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument to explore the human skin biome by sequencing microbes isolated from skin samples in order to establish a database of microbes inhabiting the human body. This FLX sequencer is a high-throughput system that can generate more than 1,000,000 individual reads with improved Q20 read length of 400 bases per 10-hour instrument run. Due to increase in sequencing demand on Roche's Genome Sequencer FLX instrument, the needs for reagents have increased. NISC is need of purchasing enough reagents to keep up with the demand and Roche Diagnostics is the sole manufacturer of these reagents. The kits are in a pre-configured format to fit directly into the Genome Sequencer FLX (454) instrument and customized if needed to fit NHGRI's need. Compatibility is essential and no other source substitute is acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; Reagents must be capable for use in Roche's Genome Sequencer FLX (454) Instrument to generate read length greater that 400 bp.<br />&bull; Reagents must be pre-configured into appropriate aliquots and be able to fit into the Genome Sequencer FLX chamber.<br />&bull; Number of reads should be greater than or equal to 1 million reads<br /><br /><strong>Government Responsibilities</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; Store reagents at stated temperature by vendor.<br /><br /><strong>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; Upon arrival of reagents to destination, the package and contents must be undamaged.<br />&bull; Upon arrival of reagents to destination, the package and contents must be at proper temperature<br /><br /><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A SOLICIATION FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with Computer Packages, Inc. for commercial items. This contract provides payment of patent maintenance and annuity fees for the patent protection of inventions of the NIH and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employees in the United States and foreign countries. This sole source is to enable Computer Packages, Inc. to also provide the above services on behalf of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The period of performance is four (4) one-year periods. This action is under authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source) because of the below:
<p><br />Only the current Contractor is uniquely qualified to perform the services required. The current Contractor, Computer Packages, Inc., has already undertaken on behalf of the Government the tracking of cases in order to maintain the patents in the United States and foreign countries and would continue to provide the service. The United States and each foreign country have different requirements, timeframes, and fees to pay. Failure to follow the appropriate steps will cause the U.S. Government to lose intellectual property rights in the United States and the foreign countries. Such a loss has a serious and direct effect on the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) has plans to award a follow-on sole-source/Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract for the F405 Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) and Engineering Investigations (EI) with Rolls-Royce PLC. This contract is for CIP projects and EIs required maintaining adequate and cost effective operational readiness safety and mission effectiveness of the T-45 aircraft propulsion and powering systems. The CIP requirements include design and development of parts, testing, engineering analysis and completion of associated engineering reports. The purpose of the analysis and testing under CIP is to resolve safety and readiness problems by ensuring design performance requirements are met, redesign low reliability components based on Fleet experiences, forecast hardware wear-out rates, confirm component life limits, identify potential flight safety programs before they occur in the Fleet, and develop design changes and repair procedures where a return-on-investment can be realized.
<p>The prospective contract is for FY2014 through FY2018, and will consist of one (1) base year period of performance plus four (4) option years. Currently, the same support is procured under Contract N00019-09-D-0001, which is a sole-source contract awarded to the same company. Rolls-Royce PLC is the only source which can provide these services because it is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the F405-RR-401 Adour Engine and Components.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for Common Network Interface (CNI) sustainment activities and legacy support to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS), 12450 Fair Lakes Circle, Fairfax, VA, 22033.

The CPFF contract will have an estimated total quantity of 8,816 hours and will be for CNI sustainment. The intended sole-source effort includes legacy services in the areas of systems engineering and software patch-development. The contract will contain provisions for other direct costs such as travel, support to travel and miscellaneous material costs. The contract will be for a base-period of one year and contain one (1) one-year option.
 This requirement is anticipated to be the final contract for this program. The contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as GDAIS is the only company that can meet the Navys Legacy CNI caretaker requirement for efforts already underway. A Request for Proposal is planned in the 3rd Quarter of FY13 with an award planned in the 3rd Quarter of FY13.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD).  This Request for Information is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201(e), and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.
  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a commitment by the U. S. Government, nor should it be construed as such.  Respondents are advised that NSWCDD is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse RFI preparation costs incurred by any offeror when providing the information requested under this notice.  If a solicitation is released at a future date, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.
It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
 
This sources sought (RFI) is for technologies to support the next generation of precision fire munitions for expeditionary and maneuver warfare, in support of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Code 30s Flight Controlled Mortar (FCMortar) Program.  
Technologies should be focused on the expansion of operational capabilities through direct enhancement of ammunition, through add-on kits or full cartridge replacement, or capability enablers for the mortar company such as lightweight mission setter, and rapid mortar tube pointing devices.  Submissions on system, sub-system, and component technologies are encouraged, and should be framed in the light of achieving the levels of performance listed below.
 Responses can be submitted via email.
The following levels of performance are requested to identify Flight Controlled Mortars of interest.

1.	Precision Delivery - Reduction of the delivery accuracy from that achievable by comparable ballistic systems to the following levels:  10m CEP50, 5m CEP50, and/or 1m CEP50

2.	Ultra Extended Range - Increase the maximum range of a ballistic system by 100% (under standard conditions).  

3.	Urban Target Engagement - Ability to achieve a vertical flight path angle (90 deg.) at sufficient altitude over an urban target area to allow terminal miss distance correction, yielding precision weapon insertion between buildings/structures, to engage targets down to street level, where ballistic fires are normally masked.

4.	Defilade Target Engagement - Ability to achieve reverse flight path angles (120deg+) at sufficient slant range to target to allow terminal miss distance correction, yielding precision weapon engagement of targets on the back side of a hill, mountain, or other terrain/topological obstruction when ballistic fires are normally masked.

5.	Operations in GPS Denied Environments - Maintenance of precision weapon delivery capability in environments where use of the Global Positioning System is not possible, either at the launcher, at the target, mid-flight, or for the complete mission.
  Solutions outside of GPS Anti-Jam and use of Semi-Active Laser (SAL) seekers are encouraged.

6.	Re-Locating/Moving Target Engagement - Ability to achieve precision target engagement against targets which have either relocated since weapon launch, and/or are continuing to move.  Integrated solutions discussing both maneuver mechanism and terminal navigation sensor are encouraged.

7.	Fuze Setter Miniaturization - Reduction of the current precision weapons setter down to a man-portable size for use by foot mobile infantry.  Integration of additional peripheral devices such as GPS, Fire Control, Mission Planning, Mapping, Weather Station, and Digital Radio is highly encouraged.  The new fuze setter device should be backwards compatible to set current precision weapons through the addition of a supplemental device/devices.

8.	Fuze Setter-less Precision Fires - Ability to deliver precision fires without the use of a programming device providing pre-launch information to the projectile, while maintaining GPS level (or better) precision.
  Solutions which do not predicate additional equipment at the gun location or require additional carried equipment by the gun crew are encouraged.

Specific Sub-System/Component Technologies of Interest:

9.	Aggressive Airframe Designs - Guided projectile airframes that are capable of producing relevant increases in Lift/Drag ratio and lateral acceleration capability, while maintaining a reasonable control slope (alpha vs. delta).  Reductions in payload capacity to achieve the desired aerodynamic performance should only be made in justification to readily available enhancements in warhead output and anticipated delivery accuracy, for maintenance of system effectiveness.

10.	Alternative Primary Navigation Sensor - Sensors other than Global Positioning System (GPS) and Semi-Active Laser (SAL) that can be used for guided projectile navigation for either the complete trajectory or mid-course.
  Solutions should be able to navigate a projectile with a robust GNC system to a delivery accuracy of 10m CEP50 or less.  Proposals should clearly identify the data products required to be transferred to the projectile prior to launch to enable the new sensor to function, and any external systems required to support its use.  Solutions that do not require additional external support devices, such as ground based beacons, or other devices which further burden logistics, are encouraged. 

11.	Alternative Terminal Navigation Sensor - Sensors other than GPS and SAL that can be used for guided projectile navigation during the terminal phase of flight, for the purposes of eliminating target location error, improve overall delivery accuracy over that of a systems mid-course navigation sensor, and/or achievement of a direct hit on a point target.
  Solutions should be able to navigate a projectile with a robust GNC to a delivery accuracy of 5m CEP50 or less, with 1m CEP50 preferred.  Proposals should clearly identify the data products required to be transferred to the projectile prior to launch to enable the new sensor to function, and any external systems required to support its use.

12.	MEMS Inertial Sensors/INS/IMUs - Sensor solutions for measurement of guided projectile inertial states and/or quantities from which inertial states can be derived.  Devices should survive high acceleration environments encountered in mortar and artillery launch environments, without out loss of calibration, and should experience low random walk during operation over use times of 1-2 minutes.
  They should also be re-calibratable during tactical operation using additional external signals.  Fidelity of measurement should exceed that of existing commercially available MEMS inertial sensor devices, but is not required to meet that of high-grade IMU devices traditionally used in missiles and other navigation applications which are usually not shock survivable, too large, or too expensive for guided projectiles.  Single sensor, sensor constellation, and integrated package solutions are encouraged.

13.	Novel Guidance Algorithms - Algorithms for guidance of projectiles that can be tuned to maximize system performance while having the flexibility to handle multiple primary navigation sensors and multiple simultaneous flight control mechanisms.
  Additional interest lies in the areas of Lift/Drag optimization, Flight Path Angle Management, and robustness to temporary sensor dropouts.  Implementation must be possible on high-g survivable, low-power processors.

14.	Multi-Axis Control Actuation Systems - Control Actuation Systems (CAS) which can drive multiple aerodynamic maneuver surfaces simultaneously and independently of each other.  CAS systems should work to minimize power consumption, and electro-magnetic interference with other projectile sub-systems.  For each axis, the CAS should provide both position and velocity feedback, in addition to an absolute zero reference that can be used to calibrate the feedback mechanisms post launch.
  Solutions that offer zero-free play actuator/drive trains are encouraged.

15.	Discarding Propulsion Systems - Propulsion systems for mortar cartridges that are no longer attached to the flight vehicle at muzzle exit, to allow for more flexible airframe design.  The propulsion system should have sufficient capability to self-eject from the launcher after the flight vehicle has exited, in a manner safe to the mortar crew.  Maintenance of a selectable charge increment system is preferred.  

16.	Hybrid Propulsion Systems - Propulsion systems which function both in the launcher and during flight of the projectile, that can provide additional kinetic energy to the projectile over that of the traditional propellant + rocket motor construct, while maintaining compatibility with existing, unmodified launchers.
  Proposers should consider the possibility of selectable fraction (i.e. percentage used in-bore vs. in-flight, for creating different mission capabilities), command extinguish/re-ignition, and/or completely new propulsion systems which are still compatible with unmodified fielded launchers.

17.	Enhanced Warheads - Enhancements to existing and/or new warhead designs to increase the overall system effectiveness against existing target sets, and expanding to additional target sets.  Designs should assume the levels of precision delivery stated above, and that warhead orientation relative to target is controllable via the projectile guidance system for certain engagement ranges.  Solutions which can further reduce collateral damage by achieving a non-lethal capacity at a given radius from the target are encouraged.

18.	Low-Power Electronics - Electronics for projectile systems which dramatically reduce overall power consumption both in-flight and during pre-launch operations.

19.	Fuze Setter to Projectile Interface Methods - New methods for interfacing fuze/data setters to projectiles that help to reduce overall fuze setter form factor, decrease both fuze setter and projectile pre-launch power consumption, and increase overall fuze setting reliability, especially in adverse environments.

All proposed technologies should be scalable/portable across the spectrum of expeditionary fire support platforms, however, proposers should tailor the submissions nominally to that of medium caliber mortars.
  Each proposal should clearly identify what system or sub-system topic area they are discussing.  More than one submission from a given proposer is acceptable if each is addressing an obviously different topic area, and is not being used to extend the length of the proposal.  Multiple submissions from the same proposer which are being used to extend the length of the proposal for a single topic area will not be accepted or reviewed.
Submissions should be made in the form of a five (5) page technical whitepaper, not including the title page, or other supplemental information as specified below.
Title Page (1)
Technical Whitepaper (5)
Supplemental Appendixes
Corporate Overview
Past/Current Relevant Work Experience

<DESC>  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to solicit Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Suite 17D, Panama City Beach, Florida 32407-4804 on a sole source basis to provide the Safety Support Requirements for the Assault Breaching System (ABS) Countermine System (CMS) Program. This weapon system safety support requires that the contractor possess the following:

1. In depth knowledge and technical experience of existing ABS CMS weapon system safety analysis and documentation.
2. Familiarity and experience providing system safety support and developing weapon system safety documentation for the ABS CMS and similar US Navy Weapons systems.
3.
 Significant experience developing successful data packages and presentations for the US Navy Weapons System Explosives Safety Review Board (WSESRB), Software System Safety Technical Review Panel (SSSTRP), and US Air Force Non Nuclear Munitions Safety Review Board (NNMSBB), in support of US Navy weapon systems programs.
4. Significant experience in developing US Navy mine weapon system assembly, training, and technical manuals.

  IPS is the only known vendor to possess the knowledge, capabilities and experience required to support this effort to the extent required.

Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights,
manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior
to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is
normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends to issue an Request for Proposal (RFP) to support BARDA's Division of Analytic Decision Support (ADS).
<p>Visual analytics, data informatics, models, and simulation tools help to better inform Federal planners and decision-makers, communicate results to stakeholders, and develop response plans for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) agents, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. These tools are required for evidence-based decision-making against CBRN threats and for all-hazards, capabilities-based planning efforts because they enable public health officials to visualize multiple what-if scenarios, consider alternatives, and weigh risks and uncertainties.</p>
<p>The requirements for the RFP will be broken out into five separate and distinct functional areas. The five functional areas are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Operational Support - Provide onsite support and coordination of daily operations for the HHS modeling hub including onsite meeting coordination, administrative services, and participation in inter-agency and intra-agency workgroups, development and presentation of technical information to a wide range of audiences.</p>
<p>(2) Strategic Studies and Analysis - Provide analysis, recommendations, and studies on an ad-hoc basis to support the development of public health response and preparedness efforts for BARDA ADS and the HHS Modeling HUB.</p>
<p>(3) Public Health and Medical Consequence Modeling - Perform medical and public health consequence modeling for CBRN agents and influenza, including components for unmitigated medical consequences, mitigated consequences, and modeling of conceptual public health responses, including concepts of operation.</p>
<p>(4) Technology Development and Systems Integration -Experience in computing and supporting technologies in visual analytics, data informatics, software development, and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>(5) Advanced Applied Research and Development - Research and development of novel analytical, modeling and simulation methods, techniques and platforms that provide anticipated and direct utility to public health and medical consequence planning and response.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be required to interface with other Government contractors as well as various Government and international entities. The Contractor will also be required to perform work at either their facility or a facility in the National Capital Region. Place of performance will be indicated in each individual task order, as specified by task order. It is the intent of HHS to allow other federal agencies to award task orders off the IDIQs awarded by HHS for agency specific tasks.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will be for one base year with four option years. For functional areas 1, 2, 3 and 5 this acquisition will be unrestricted to allow for full and open competition. Functional area #4 will be a small business set aside. Once IDIQ awards are made each task order will be competed amongst contract holders with each contract holder being given a "fair opportunity" for award. Additional details and information will be described in the solicitation. NAICS Code - 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility:</p>
<p>For lots #1, #2, #3, and #4, the Offeror or its subcontractors shall possess the necessary credentials to work with classified materials.</p>
<p>Presoliciation Notice Objective:</p>
<p>This Presolicitation Notice is issued pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.

<DESC>Construction Project No. 656-12-237, entitled Upgrade Street Lighting at the St. Cloud VA Health Care System, St. Cloud, Minnesota.  This solicitation is issued as an IFB (Invitation for Bid) construction project, which is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS firms.  All bidders must be registered on www.sam.gov, www.vetbiz.gov and https://orca.bpn.gov by the bid due date.  The NAICS code is 236220.  This work is for the purpose of the replacement of street and parking lot HID lighting with high efficiency LED lighting.  Work includes the removal of existing HID fixtures and the installation of new LED fixtures, while retaining the existing poles and bases.  Wiring from the base to the fixture will be replaced.

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", this will be a sole source acquisition to KNAPP Logistics & Automation Inc., 2124 Barrett Park Drive, Suite 100, Kennesaw, GA 30144.  

The upgrade consists of new hardware and software that must be integrated into the existing automated pharmaceutical dispensing production environment in order for the system to function properly.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Western Service Area, Western-Pacific Region, AAQ-530, has a requirement for Janitorial Services for the FAAs new Air Traffic Control Tower and Base Building at the Oakland Intl Airport in Oakland, CA.

This is a new facility that was constructed with the goal of achieving LEED Gold certification.  All janitorial services will conform to the strictest LEED requirements.  The contractor must have as a member of their permanent management staff a full time employee who is LEED certified as an Accredited Professional (AP) in the area of Operations and Maintenance.  The LEED certified AP must be directly responsible to any resulting contract and be available and responsible to the FAAs questions and concerns at all times.  Interested janitorial firms must have at least 3-years experience in janitorial services with at least 1-year experience with a LEED certified facility.  Experience must include service to other government facilities or large size companies.  

Interested firms must have an office within 50-miles of the facility.  This office must be maintained during the entire life of the contract.  Map Quest will be used to determine the distance.  A Post Office Box address will not be accepted.  See the attached RFO and Statement of Work for complete requirements.

This procurement is set-aside as a Tiered Evaluation type solicitation.  
  1.	 A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in the source selection of this procurement, and offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns have been received.  There must be at least 2-responsive, qualified and responsible offers in any tier for competition to exist in that tier.  
  2.	Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
  3.	Tiered evaluation of offers is used to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR/RFO.  Therefore, all size business concerns are invited to respond to this solicitation.
  4.	The CO must consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.  The tiered order of precedence for this solicitation (descending in order) is as follows:
     a.	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBAs 8(a) program.
     b.	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).
     c.	Very small business.
     d.	Small business.
     e.	Other than small business.
  5.	Once offers are received, the CO will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified above.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next tier until an award can be made.
Results from our Market Research indicate that there are very few small businesses that are interested and qualified in accordance with the project Statement of Work.  Therefore, other than small businesses are encouraged to participate in this solicitation.

The FAA anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The period of performance is expected to start on May 1, 2013 and end on September 30, 2013 (5-month base period) with four, 1-year options.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is: 561720 Janitorial Services, size standard $16.5 million.  The FAA will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of your offer.

Offerors must attend a mandatory job walk on either April 9, 2013 or April 16, 2013.  Offers are due no later than 1:00 PM PDT on April 22, 2013, unless changed by RFO Amendment.  See RFO Section L for complete submittal instruction.

This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $750,000.  For further information and applicable forms concerning STLP, call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

<DESC>Military Sealift Command's T-AKE class vessels have been having issues with the operation and maintenance of the pressure transducer Tank Level Indicators (TLIs) for the Salt Water Ballast Tanks throughout the vessel. The current Bergen Salt Water Ballast Tank sensors are giving false indications and false level readings. Rust and mud within the TLI sounding tube prevents proper maintenance, which does not allow the sensor to be removed to perform recommended checks on the TLI sensor. A 3D AutoCAD model of the spaces as they exist now is required to plan the modification of these spaces.<br /><br />Please see attached for required services and requested responses.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC), Energy Conservation Services <br> Solicitation Number: W912DY13RUE13 <br> Agency: Department of the Army <br> Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <br> Location: USACE HNC, Huntsville <br>  <br> Classification Code: <br> R -- Professional, administrative, and management support services <br>  <br> NAICS Code: <br> 221122 Electric Power Distribution <br> 221210 Natural Gas Distribution <br> 221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems <br>  <br> 1. Contract Information: The US Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) energy management project for the US Army Garrison (USAG), Fort Campbell KY. <br>  <br> 2. Background: 10 USC 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities.  42 USC 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below. <br>  <br>   - Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities. <br>  <br>   - Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand. <br>  <br>   - Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency. <br>  <br>   - If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives. <br>  <br> 3. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.  <br>  <br> 4. Project Information:  The requirement at the USAG Fort Campbell KY, is for the contractor to design, engineer, construct, commission and third-party finance if necessary a 1.9 to 2.0 megawatt (MW) solar/photovoltaic array to be located atop Landfill 5, located in the State of Kentucky, on USAG Fort Campbell KY. <br>  <br> 5. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

The requirement is for a bridge contract for these services for the DOL for a period of three months with six one-month options and award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This acquisition will be procured under 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to award a contract with a selected firm using single source procedures.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the renewal of SOLHID user licenses for maintenance of equipment and software located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center and Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.

SOLHID - Solaris Host Interface Device, BTI DBG, HID 370 - Channel Software, HID - Device Drivers, and HID - Firmware Emulation are Sunhillo products used on the User Request Evaluation Tool. This product is only offered and maintained by Sunhillo Corporation.

The FAA contemplates awarding a purchase order to fulfill this requirement, with a period of performance of 3/31/2013 - 3/30/2014. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services.

The FAA currently receives support from Sunhillo for these products.  The determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm is necessitated due to the complex nature of the products requiring support, the unique combination of products requiring support, requirement for a single vendor to provide support at multiple locations, and required continuity of support for these products.
  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions or inquiries resulting from this announcement shall be addressed to William Bleda, Contracting Officer, at William.Bleda@faa.gov. 

This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>-  Does the agency expect to provide business proprietary information and trade secrets with the awardee?  We see no reason to share proprietary information and trade secrets to receive legal database services.  We only want their service available to us for research.
-  How many ONRR employees will have access to the terminals described in the Scope of Work?  The terminals will be available to all ONRR staff at the Denver location (approximately 500 employees).  As indicated in the Scope of Work, all 500 must be able to access the database through the single terminal (obviously not simultaneously).
-  Are these terminals in a place of public access? Will people from the general public have access to the terminals, or will access be restricted to ONRR employees?  Access will be restricted to ONRR employees.  The general public will not have access to the terminals.
-  The Scope of Work states that the ONRR will purchase up to five individual subscriptions for the terminals. It is understood that the five terminals will reside across three locations, including Denver, Washington, D.C., and Houston. How will the terminals be divided (e.g., how many terminals per location)? Is the ONRR proposing that there will be five access points (five terminals) where only one person will have access to online legal research per terminal at a given time?  This contract will initially only provide terminals in Denver, but ONRR wants to reserve the right to extend the contract to provide other terminals in Houston and D.C.  But, at the most, there will only be 5 terminals available to staff across these locations.
-  In paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Scope of Work, ONRR provides requirements respectively for content and features. Is all of the content described in paragraph 2 considered mandatory, or is some or all of the content considered desirable, but not mandatory? Similarly, are all of the features described in paragraph 3 considered mandatory, or are some or all of the content considered desirable, but not mandatory?  It is stated in the Scope of Work that content in paragraph 2 must be provided--it is a mandatory requirement.  Features in paragraph 3 are also a requirement.   
-  Could you please confirm the proposal due date. Page 1 indicates that the proposal is due: 03/29/2013 at 1300 MD, yet on page 2, the due date is listed as: not later than 1600 (4 p.m.) EST February 25, 2013. Also, could ONRR please change the cover page of the solicitation to reflect the correct date? Proposals are due 03/29/2013 at 1300 MD.
-  On page 3, each of the CLINs include a period of performance, with the exception of CLIN 00060. Could you please provide dates to clarify the period of performance for that CLIN and update the continuation sheet (page 3) to reflect the change? Please see Amendment 0001 reflecting the change.
-   How should offerors submit proposals to ONRR? Via FedConnect? Would the Office consider receiving proposals by email? Please send offers via email to Danielle_T_Weed@nbc.gov.

<DESC><br />The Government intends to negotiate a noncompetitive Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract with University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (I2) for connectivity of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) facilities to NOAA Research Network or N-WAVE. The noncompetitive contract shall be awarded for one base year or performance with four (4) one year option periods. The Government anticipates that the base period will commence on or about July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014. The option periods, if exercised, are from July 01, 2014 through June 30, 2018. The total performance of this contract shall not exceed five (5) years.
<p>NOAA's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OICO) designed, engineered, and built N-WAVE that interconnects many of NOAA's research facilities throughout the country. N-WAVE is undergoing continuous technological improvements and expansion in order to integrate NOAAs' Internal research efforts as well as the research efforts of external educational and nonprofit organizations. NOAA's research facilities, research universities and nonprofit organizations are geographically dispersed across the world. Internet2, which is network collaboration between universities, partners in industry and government to develop advanced Internet technologies and applications, provides the physical infrastructure (optical fiber circuits) for connectivity among the wide dispersion of research entities and is the foundation of N-WAVE's national backbone network. As an organization, Internet2 members leverage their high-performance network and worldwide partnerships to support and enhance their educational and research missions. Beyond providing networking capabilities for support of research, the Internet2 community engages in the improvement of this valuable research tool by developing new technology such as middleware, security, network research and performance measurement capabilities which ultimately enhance their primary mission, which are research activities.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is to expand N-WAVE in order to assist NOAA in performing scientific research in conjunction with joint institutes, university collaborators, and other partnering government agencies such as the Department of Interior, Department of Defense, Department of Energy and NASA. NOAA requires high-speed Wide Area Networking (WAN) connectivity services to these entities to facilitate sharing data in furtherance of its mission. The technical services required to support the NOAA's N-WAVE are described below. <br />National/Regional Connectivity Services<br />Provide access to a flexible advanced Internet Protocol (IP) network, built on a carrier class network infrastructure that is able to support one Gigabits per second (1Gbps); ten Gigabits per second (10Gbps); and one hundred Gigabits per second (100 Gbps) connections. This IP network will interconnect N-WAVE with NOAA cooperative institutes, NOAA customer sites, research and education partners and other government agencies.</p>
<p>Provide the following static N-Wave 10Gbps point-to-point network circuits and Metro services:<br />i. Denver, CO to Chicago, IL <br />ii. Denver, CO to Atlanta, GA <br />iii. McLean, VA to Philadelphia, PA <br />iv. New York, NY to Chicago, IL via Boston <br />v. McLean, VA to Chicago, IL <br />vi. Chicago, IL to Atlanta, GA <br />vii. McLean, VA to Atlanta, GA <br />viii. McLean, VA to Pittsburgh, PA <br />ix. McLean, VA to Raleigh, NC<br />x. Chicago Metro Services <br />xi. New York Metro Services<br />xii. Atlanta Metro Services</p>
<p>Provide additional static N-Wave 10Gbps point-to-point network circuits as required.</p>
<p>All 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GE) framed point-to-point circuits must be provisioned on network equipment that is able to provide auto-restoration capabilities at Layer1 across 3-way junctions. A sub-one minute time to restore is preferred.</p>
<p>Collocation Services <br />Provide collocation services or interconnectivity functions at pre-existing locations/sites or to permit access to national research and education networks. Collocation services may be implemented at similar connection boundaries between N-WAVE and other networks (e.g. national research and education networks, Internet2 and NLR, and commodity internet) at a core location in N-WAVE. All collocation services shall be capable of accommodating at least two telecommunication racks with 100A of redundant -48v to -54v DC power per rack in the following locations: <br />i. Denver, Co <br />ii. McLean, Va<br />iii. Chicago, Ill<br />iv. Atlanta, Ga<br />Provide additional collocation services as required to support N-Wave growth to include such sites as Kansas City, Missouri and FT. Worth Texas. <br />Provide out of band telecommunications lines at the collocation facilities for back up access to N-WAVE network equipment. <br />Engineering and Future Expansion of Services <br />The ability for NOAA to expand on the capacity of those items listed under Connectivity Services by purchasing additional 10Gb connections and where required: <br />i. Provide access to new networking technologies and services that may become available; for example the increase from 10G to 40G or 100G capacity circuits; <br />ii. Provide for the modification of bandwidth for any subscribed connectivity item listed under Connectivity Services <br />iii. Through relationships with the Regional Optical Networks, where feasible, provide engineering and integration services for site connectivity to N-Wave. <br />Integration Services <br />Where the relationship exists, the contractor shall obtain on behalf of N-Wave and those NOAA organizations N-Wave supports, access to services provided by the Research and Education Regional Optical Networks (RON). The contractor shall be the integrator of RON services to N-Wave by acting on behalf of N-Wave to acquire connectivity, collocation and engineering services offered by a given RON.</p>
<p>In contracting with University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (I2), NOAA leverages substantial research investment as a long standing member of multiple research consortiums. This proposed action will also enforce NOAA's commitment to current and future network access privileges granted through consortium "Indefeasible Right of Use" agreements (IRUs). Finally, NOAA's opportunity to enhance its leadership role in research is sustained through collaboration with Federal agencies labs, non-profit organizations, universities, libraries and technology and information service providers throughout the United States.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals. It is the Government's belief that I2 is the only entity capable of meeting the requirements above. Any potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to meet these requirements may demonstrate its ability to meet the requirements stated above by submitting a capabilities statement via email no later than 15 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. Any response must include sufficient information to allow the Government to evaluate its capability relative to the technical requirements stated herein.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to negotiate a sole source contract to the Organization of American States (OAS) under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1(Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements). The Government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It is the Government's belief that only the Organization of American States can complete this project.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for OAS to provide support services such as document management, data management, meeting organization and support which is expected to facilitate U.S. Government engagement in the Summit of the Americas process, improve coordination among international organizations in the implementation of Summit initiatives, increase the engagement between social actors/civil society and governments in the Summit process, and ensure timely and reliable access to information and reporting pertaining to the Summit process.<br />
<p>The Summits of the Americas Secretariat (SAS) was formed out of the Second Summit of the Americas (Santiago, 1998), at which leaders assigned the responsibility for technical support of the Summit of the Americas process to the Organization of American States (OAS).  From this mandate, the OAS formed an office for Summit follow-up, which has become the SAS.  In its role as the secretariat for the Summit of the Americas, SAS must support the involvement of participating governments in the Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG), coordinate the member institutions of the Joint Summit Working Group (JSWG), facilitate access for social actors to the Summit process, and maintain and disseminate information on Summit documents, meetings, and follow-up activities.</p>
<p>The United States government - primarily through the Department of State (DOS) and in particular the WHA Office of Regional Economic Policy and Summit Coordination (WHA/EPSC) is a participant in the SIRG, and utilizes the information and institutional capacities of the SAS.  Additionally, DOS has asked that the SAS, in its capacity as the secretariat for the Summit and chair of the JSWG, to organize and conduct coordination meetings among the member institutions of the JSWG in order to improve the implementation of Summit initiatives undertaken by the United States and partner governments; and to enhance opportunities for social actor/civil society engagement with the United States government and partner governments through the use of information technology and the facilitation of virtual and in-person meetings.  Any funds provided to SAS by DOS are expected to be utilized by SAS in accordance with the related Statement of Work (SOW) to cover operational, logistical and other costs associated with DOS' participation in the SIRG and JSWG.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. There is no solicitation document. No RFP will be made available for competitive proposals.  Phone calls will not be accepted. The main point of contact for this requirement is Patrick Dermidoff (Contracting Officer) at dermidoffpt@state.gov.  Please reference "OAS" in the subject line of any email. Interested parties may express their interest and will be allowed to provide a capabilities statement no later than Thursday, April 11, 2013 at 11:00 AM EST. If no viable responses are received, the U.S. Department of State will negotiate solely with OAS.</p>

<DESC>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), Contract Operations Division -Falls Church (COD-FC), 7700 Arlington Blvd., Falls Church, Virginia, 22042, intends to enter into a sole source agreement with Clinicomp International.
<p>Description of Services:<br />This award provides for the maintenance of the CIS HL7 unidirectional interface with the Nutrition COTS (Computrition Hospitality Suite) SW program. This interface provides all data needed from the Order Entry/Inpatient module of the ESSENTRIS application for the Nutrition Clinic in DoD MTFs to facilitate feeding of the inpatient population. <br />CIS currently provides an HL7 unidirectional interface with the Nutrition COTS SW application at 42 MTFs.  The DHSS Clinical - Nutrition Management Information System (NMIS) Program Manager is seeking to sustain/maintain that CIS HL7 interface for all DoD MTFs that currently utilize the CIS HL7 interface application for Diet Order prescription entry by the attending physician as a part of an inpatients order entry.<br />ESSENTRIS is currently deployed to numerous DoD MTFs and is used by the attending physician at those MTFs to enter ADT and ORD data that is required by the Nutrition COTS SW application for nutritional needs of inpatients. The NMIS PM initialized the ESSENTRIS interface with the Nutrition COTS SW application using the existing interface configuration in use in production at all current Nutrition COTS SW host sites where ESSENTRIS is used.  The CIS HL7 unidirectional interface must adhere to the Nutrition COTS SW application Interface Control Document (ICD) and may need routine maintenance and technical support as a result of day-to-day operational support.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL - Not Required</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>52.24-403-70 Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.1. Long-Term<br />Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);</p>
<p>b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;</p>
<p>c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.<br />Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:</p>
<p>&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation</p>
<p>d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:</p>
<p>1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 2) Favorable fingerprint results; 3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:</p>
<p>a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; b. Favorable fingerprint results; c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and d.<br />Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.<br />This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelvemonth period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p>a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p>b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p>c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p>d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p>e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.<br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p>3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>
<p>5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court re- view of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice un- der I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is<br />in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under<br />11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

To optimize the capabilities of this tool, very high quality TEM specimens must be prepared. Many of the specimens examined in the NanoFab's TEM are prepared by focused ion beam systems, and the final lamellae are on the order of 5-10 micrometers in size. A low-energy argon ion mill that can focus the ion beam down to a size of 5 micrometers or less is required to remove the amorphous damage layer created on the specimen's surface during FIB-TEM sample preparation, without sputtering the support substrate material onto the lamella. To minimize damage to the specimen, a variable ion beam energy of 50 eV to 2 keV is required.</p>
<p><br />Minimum Requirements</p>
<p>The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below. All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award.</p>

<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 (b) (11)): This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.<br /><br />Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK - POSITION DESCRIPTION <br />A. POSITION TITLE <br />Government&#8208;to&#8208;Government Technical Advisor <br />B. ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF THE POSITION <br />USAID Barbados and Eastern Caribbean<br />C. OVERVIEW <br />Beginning in 2005 with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the United States government and other donors committed to making greater use of partner country systems (G2G) to implement directly donors' assistance programs in partner countries. That commitment was accelerated in 2008 in the Accra Agenda for Action, in which the donors agreed to consider use of partner country systems as the "first option" to implement donor programs, rather than other donor systems such as third party, non-governmental contractors and grantees.</p>
<p>The realization of this goal is especially complex in the unique context of the USAID Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Mission. The Mission currently works through bilateral relations and with multi-government entities including the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). In addition, the Mission is exploring increased opportunities to work with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), a respected central banking institution established by and for local governments that works closely with other donors in the implementation of development programs.</p>
<p>USAID has begun to operationalize the United States government commitments to consider and if prudent, invest more resources in, G2G assistance, through the development of a set of Agency polices entitled "Use of Reliable Partner Country Systems for Direct Management and Implementation of Assistance (ADS 220)". USAID in the Eastern Caribbean is well positioned to be a leader and a model in this effort due to the favorable political conditions, the presence of viable partners, and the general consensus on regional development priorities.</p>
<p>USAID efforts will be reinforced by the commitment of OECS and national governments to assume a greater role in setting priorities, developing strategies, evaluating programs and accounting for results. This position will work closely with the local governments and multi-government entities to ensure a clear understanding of responsibilities under G2G programming and to help countries build knowledge and capacity and thereby reduce their need for foreign assistance over time.</p>
<p>The incumbent of this position will advise the Mission Director and the technical specialists on the implementation of Government-to-Government programs to include programs implemented through regional organizations such as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and the Caribbean Development Bank. He or she will actively seek opportunities to advance G2G programming especially where assessments have determined adequate controls and the potential for success. <br />The incumbent will also monitor Agency policy related to G2G programming and implementation and will make recommendations that ensure the Mission is in compliance with policy and directives. The incumbent will monitor and share information on Agency initiatives including the USAID Forward agenda and provide leadership in promoting and implementing activities that support those initiatives. This position will lead across sectors in the identification of local partners and opportunities to most effectively deliver foreign assistance in a manner consistent with the USAID Forward agenda.</p>
<p>D. POSITION ELEMENTS <br />Supervision Received: This position will be generally supervised by the USAID Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Mission Director. The incumbent will be expected to work independently to a large extent and lead the cross-sectoral effort to increase G2G programming and advance USAID Forward initiatives. <br />Available Guidelines: The position requires an understanding of US Government and Agency regulations. The incumbent will have in-depth understanding of the Agency's Automated Directive System (ADS) with particular focus on Section 220 regarding G2G programming. The position will also require familiarity with regulations of the OECS, CARICOM, and the individual countries within the Mission's responsibility. This position may also function as Agreement Officer's Representative and will therefore require the necessary certification.<br />Exercise of Judgment: The G2G Advisor must exercise sound and independent judgment in interpreting and applying USG and USAID&#8208;specific regulations and standard operating procedures in the course of carrying out the assigned duties. A high degree of judgment will be required to provide guidance and technical assistance to a wide variety of clients and stakeholders in the region. As a recognized expert and highly qualified professional, substantial reliance will be placed on the incumbent to independently plan, prioritize, and carry out the specific activities entailed in fulfilling major duties and responsibilities. The incumbent will be expected to resolve problems that arise by determining the approaches to be taken and methodologies to be used; making independent judgments that can be defended as necessary. <br />Authority to Make Commitments: None. <br />Nature, Level and Purpose of Contacts: The incumbent will establish and maintain professional working relationships with US Government personnel in Washington and in the field necessary to successfully carry&#8208;out his/her responsibilities. The incumbent will also establish and maintain professional working relationships with ministerial and senior level officials of host&#8208;country governments, regional member&#8208;state organizations, international and non&#8208;profit organizations, local and regional businesses as necessary to achieve his/her objective of advancing USG G2G and USAID Forward activities in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean.<br />Supervision Exercised: The incumbent will not have formal supervisory responsibilities but will at times be expected to lead teams of Mission staff in the implementation of G2G services and the development of productive partnerships with local organizations. <br />Interpersonal Skills: The incumbent will have outstanding interpersonal skills and be capable of representing the Agency in his/her interactions with representatives of host&#8208;country governments and regional organizations. The G2G program is largely new and in the developmental stages and the incumbent will be required to resolve challenges and differences of opinion that may arise during the course of the work, for which there either is not a clear solution or where cultural differences may complicate the situation. <br />Time Required to Perform Full Range of Duties: Immediately. The incumbent is expected to be an expert in the field of the provision of official development assistance from a donor government to agencies of a recipient government. <br />Period of Performance: The personal service contract will be for a period of two years. Extensions will be contingent on the need for continued services, satisfactory performance and availability of funds. <br />E. SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES <br />1. Lead efforts to initiate, promote and support official USG development assistance through Government to Government agreements. Provide advice to USAID personnel as well as officials of governments in the region regarding the requirements for G2G programs and the actions to be taken to maximize the possibilities of success.<br />2. Provide comprehensive technical and support services to advance G2G programming in the region. This position may include responsibilities as Agreement Officer's Representative or alternate for one or more activities. USAID Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean has been one of the most active Missions pursuing the use of G2G and in working with local organizations. By FY15, it is expected that over $20 million or more than 75% of USAID assistance will be programmed with governments in the region and local partners. This position will be critical in developing the agreements and programs that will help reach that goal. <br />3. Ensure the involvement of appropriate personnel in meetings with or the review of documents from officials of the government institutions in any of the countries served by the USAID Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Mission. Such personnel may include the representatives from the relevant technical offices and the regional legal, financial management and procurement offices. <br />4. Monitor the status of all G2G activities and potential G2G activities. Ensure that assessments and program development and implementation services fulfill the requirements of the Public Financial Management Risk Assessment Framework (PFMRAF) process as well as any other of the Agency's financial&#8208;management and procurement standard&not; operating&#8208;procedures (SOP). <br />5. Provide leadership on USAID donor coordination in the region including serving as Mission point of contact for other bilateral and multilateral donor organizations working in the countries served by USAID Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. Make recommendations to the Mission Director as well as LAC Bureau and Agency leadership on the potential for collaboration with other donors and the activities and successes of the donor community. <br />6. Ensure that all G2G consulting services provided by the regional mission are carefully tracked and documented. Provide regular reports to Mission and Agency leadership on the G2G services provided by the mission and progress made toward achieving USAID Forward and G2G targets. <br />7. Educate colleagues and partners on G2G programming and ensure that "best practices" and "lessons learned" are disseminated to inform future activities. <br />8. Collaborate with the Development Outreach Coordinator to publicize G2G success stories and increase awareness of successful G2G activities in the region. <br />9. Actively pursue cross&#8208;training and the development of expertise in USAID Forward local capacity development (LCD) and talent management. <br />10. In addition to G2G programming, actively seek opportunities to program using local organizations and make recommendations of local organizations or institutions that have the capacity or the potential capacity to implement USAID programs.</p>

<p><br />&bull; Degree of responsibility for decision-making assigned to the position: The R/EXO plans and executes major administrative and operational programs with wide latitude for exercise of independent judgment and decision making. S/he must exercise sound and independent judgment in interpreting and applying United States Government (USG) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) specific regulations and standard operating procedures in the course of carrying out the assigned duties. In instances not clearly covered by written guidelines, the incumbent will use her/his own personal, well informed judgment in devising innovative approaches to resolving technical, administrative, managerial and/or policy problems. Excellent (balanced) judgment must be exercised in setting priorities. The use of initiative, discretion and patience is expected from the incumbent in dealing with mission personnel, as well as representatives from other agencies and organizations, including host governments, to resolve problems that arise during the course of work for which there is often no clear or immediate solution. The incumbent will also be required to follow and adhere to all applicable standards of conduct. The R/EXO is expected to have a contracting warrant.

<p>&bull; Level of complexity of work assignments: The incumbent's duties and responsibilities will involve the full range of consultative, advisory, management, and administrative aspects for USAID/Dominican Republic and the client missions. There is a high level of complexity in the host government's organizational structure. There will be considerable interaction with representatives of other USG agencies, State Department ICASS Officers in the different countries where the regional administrative services will be provided.

<p>&bull; Supervisory Controls: Supervision will be provided by the USAID/Dominican Republic Deputy Mission Director or his/her designee. Incumbent is expected to work with minimum direction and supervision. The need for quick response in high profile, complex and often fluid situations requires the incumbent to exercise discretion and good judgment and operate with high levels of autonomy, responsibility and authority. Mission Directors of the other client missions will also provide direction to the R/EXO.</p>
<p>&bull; Guidelines: Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH), USAID Automated Directives System (ADS), Federal Travel Regulations, U.S. Department of State Standardized Regulations, Bilateral Agreements, Foreign Service National Local Compensation Plan, ICASS Handbook, Mission Orders and Mission Notices. Guidelines may not specifically apply to many situations and will have to be interpreted, requiring considerable experience and judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Complexity of the work environment/effect on the position's responsibilities: <br />The client missions have a complex portfolio of bilateral, unilateral and regional programs. The incumbent must exercise sound high level professional judgment in responding to issues as they arise. The position requires a very high level of independence in developing and managing the client missions administrative operations. S/he will provide policy guidance to Senior Management and the missions as a whole including USDH, US &amp; FSN Personal Service contractors. The incumbent will need to be able to respond rapidly and with sound judgment to issues as they arise. Incumbent will frequently be called upon to summarize complex issues and situations in a succinct and relevant manner for senior management and will also be required to recommend courses of action. The incumbent will be required to travel frequently to the client missions.</p>
<p>&bull; Scope and effect of the work performed: The key responsibility of the position is to lead and direct the work of a total staff consisting of: USAID /Dominican Republic: 55 FSNs, and 22 American staff; USAID/Jamaica: 22 FSNs and 9 American staff; USAID/Barbados and Eastern Caribbean: 12 FSNs and 8 American staff; USAID/Guyana (satellite mission to Barbados): 2 FSNs and 1 TCN staff. The incumbent will be looked to as the expert in all aspects of administrative and management operations. Decisions and actions taken by the incumbent will affect the client missions' operations.</p>
<p>&bull; Level and purpose of contacts: Personal contacts are with senior mission staff, office directors, U.S. Embassy personnel and host country government counterparts, international and local contractors, retailers and service providers, senior USAID/Washington staff and regional offices, institutional contractors and governmental and non-governmental authorities. S/he will establish and maintain solid working relationships with all levels of mission personnel at USAID/Dominican Republic, USAID/Jamaica, and USAID/Barbados and Eastern Caribbean.

The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-66. This procurement will be issued on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 333120 with a size standard of 750 employees.  <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers - Memphis District has a requirement for the purchase of three (3) Caterpillar D6N, LGP Track-Type Tractors, Brand Name or Equal.

See the attached document under the area below titled  quote mark Additional Info quote mark  for the complete set of specifications and the quote sheet.  The quoted sheet contains the contract line item number and items, quantities, and units of measure. <br>   <br> DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS: <br> The contractor will be responsible for the delivery of the equipment to the Ensley Engineer Yard, 2915 Riverport Rd, Memphis, Tennessee 38109.  The delivery of the equipment shall be coordinated with technical government personnel.  The requested delivery date is not later than 120 days after the receipt of award.  All quotes shall include the proposed delivery date.   <br>  <br> The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. <br>  <br> Clause 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items;  <br>  <br> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br>  <br> (i) Technical Acceptability <br> (ii)  Past Performance  <br> (iii) Price <br>  <br> The government will issue an award to the quoter whose quote is the lowest price of those determined to meet at least the minimum requirements to be determined technically acceptable & demonstrates acceptable past performance.  <br>  <br> (1) Technical Acceptability - the ability to meet the minimum requirements as specified in this solicitation and the attached specification document.  To be determined technically acceptable, quoters must provide technical specifications for the equipment they are quoting. It is incumbent upon the quoter to submit sufficient documentation of their technical capability, such as experience of the company and/or experience of key personnel, equipment lists, etc. and/or any other information available to enable the Government to make a determination of the company's technical ability to complete contracts of this type, size, scope and complexity.  <br>  <br> (2) Past Performance - To demonstrate acceptable past performance, the quoter shall provide documentation of performance on past or current contracts of a similar type, size, scope and complexity, performed within the last three (3) years including references, with names and contact information of the references who can verify such past performance.  Past performance information of key personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance.  In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the quoter will be evaluated as unknown on Past Performance, providing the quoter supplies a certified statement with their quote that no past performance information is available.  The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify acceptable past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc.  The quoter is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating past performance rests with the quoter.  <br>  <br> It is incumbent upon the quoter to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, past performance, and price.  Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance, and price may be cause for rejection of your quote.  <br>  <br>  <br> SAM REGISTRATION:  <br> All quoters shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), if you are not registered in (SAM), an award CANNOT be made to your company.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Ms. Yulia Burmistenko<br />International Public Affairs Manager<br />DTEK LLC<br />2a, Mechnikova street<br />Parus Business Centre, 23rd floor<br />Kiev 01601Ukraine<br />Phone: +38 044 581 453<br />E-Mail: BurmistenkoYV@dtek.com</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the replacement of outdated power generation units at the Burshtynskaya power plant.</p>
<p>The Grantee, DTEK LLC, through its subsidiary Zakhidenergo, owns and operates the coal-fired Burshtynskaya Power Plant, consisting of 12 power generation units with a combined capacity of 2,300 megawatts (MW).  DTEK plans to replace four of the units (approximately 200MW units each for a total of nearly 800MW though timing of replacement will depend on recommendations of the Feasibility Study).  DTEK is considering multiple technologies for the replacement units, including ultra-supercritical, supercritical, and circulating fluidized bed, with sizes of individual units dependent on multiple factors.  The new units would have modern air pollution controls, reducing emissions of SOx, NOx and other pollutants to one sixth the amount for the electricity produced.  The power from this plant would be sold on the nationwide wholesale electricity market at market-based prices or exported.  The expected cost of eventual replacement of the four existing 200 MW units is approximately $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>DTEK is a Ukrainian energy company that is a subsidiary of SCM (System Capital Management), a Ukrainian diversified industrial group.  DTEK owns coal mines and majority stakes in power generation companies Vostokenergo, Zakhidenergo, and Dniproenergo.  Total electric power generation capacity of DTEK is in excess of 19 GW.  DTEK is interested in determining U.S. solutions and equipment for this project.</p>
<p>This Feasibility Study will assess the technical, economic and financial feasibility of and aid the Grantee in soliciting offers for, the construction of new coal-fired unit(s) at the existing Burshtynskaya Thermal Power Plant (TPP) and retire the equivalent coal-fired units that are over 40 years old.  This study shall review four existing 200 megawatt (MW) units at Burshtynskaya TPP.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $602,435 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM local time, April 30, 2013</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>*** 27 March 2013 ***
<p>There have been a couple clarification questions proposed in regard to the purchase description. The question along with the engineer's response are below:</p>
<p>The scope of Purchase Description 13E-178A-RF Rev 3 states that "The LPNG must also be able to emulate an 8664A option H15 in the E5504B Phase Noise System Console using a DCFM or EFC input to control frequency and be able to be used outside of the Phase Noise System console with the same specifications."</p>
<p>1) Is this a binding requirement as it is only stated in the Scope and does not appear elsewhere in the Purchase Description?</p>
<p>Response: It is binding and has to work in the E5504 B Phase Noise Measurement system.</p>
<p>2) What are the exact technical requirements of emulation?</p>
<p>Response: As required in the Agilent Phase Noise software . The software can be downloaded at :<br /><a href="http://www.home.agilent.com/agilent/software.jspx?ckey=2149972&amp;lc=eng&amp;cc=US&amp;nid=-11143.0.00&amp;id=2149972">http://www.home.agilent.com/agilent/software.jspx?ckey=2149972&amp;lc=eng&amp;cc=US&amp;nid=-11143.0.00&amp;id=2149972</a></p>

<p>DLAD 52.215-9023 REVERSE AUCTION (NOv, 2012)</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.</p>
<p>(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.</p>
<p>(d) The lowest offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(e) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted, the "Not Lead" offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; it will be ineligible for award if the final price in the auction is the tie offer price.</p>
<p>(f) An offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction.</p>
<p>(g) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.</p>
<p>(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.</p>
<p>(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator.</p>
<p>(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award.</p>
<p>(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control.</p>
<p>(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.</p>
<p>(6) Training:<br />(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.<br />(ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a 'trained offeror.' Only trained offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror employee to become a 'trained offeror.' The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the 'trained offeror' designation from any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>E. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>THIS IS THE FORMAL PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204</p>
<p>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Base Realignment and Closure Branch (772 ESS/PKJ), JBSA-Lackland AFB, TX 78236-9861, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the NM/AZ PBR requirement. This is a major source selection for environmental cleaning in support of AFCEC and its customers on DoD installations in New Mexico, Cannon AFB, Holloman AFB, Kirtland AFB, and in Arizona, Luke AFB.</p>
<p>The Air Force is required to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment. The intent of this PBR effort is to maximize the number of Site Closeouts (SCs) or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner for eighty-Eight (88) Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites, and twenty-one (21) Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) sites in the PBR contract. It is desirable to the Air Force that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR part 15 and FAR supplements thereto. This procurement will be solicited under small business set-aside. The contract is contemplated to be an stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed-price pricing arrangement. The Government anticipates awarding (1) contract with a ROM of $30 - $40 million, and a POP of 120 months. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910.</p>
<p>We anticipate releasing the Final RFP in FebBizOpps on or about 28 March 2013.</p>
<p>Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this RFP require clarification(s) to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing within 10 days of publication of the RFP.</p>
<p>All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP.

<p>&bull; Maintaining an unqualified financial statement audit opinion.</p>
<p>&bull; Providing timely and accurate formulation estimates for loan programs that should maintain zero percent subsidy rates in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensuring cash flow models meet all existing Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) requirements, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives, and Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) standards, statements, technical releases and other requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Enhancing the Disaster Assistance credit model to improve operation efficiencies, produce subsidy estimates, and function as a tool to assess the performance of the program.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) has plans to award a follow-on sole-source Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract for the F405 Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) and Engineering Investigations (EI) with Rolls-Royce PLC. This contract is for CIP projects and EIs required for&nbsp;maintaining adequate and cost effective operational readiness safety and mission effectiveness of the T-45 aircraft propulsion and powering systems. The CIP requirements include design and development of parts, testing, engineering analysis and completion of associated engineering reports. The purpose of the analysis and testing under CIP is to resolve safety and readiness problems by ensuring design performance requirements are met, redesign low reliability components based on Fleet experiences, forecast hardware wear-out rates, confirm component life limits, identify potential flight safety programs before they occur in the Fleet, and develop design changes and repair procedures where a return-on-investment can be realized.
<p>The prospective contract is for FY2014 through FY2018, and will consist of one (1) base year period of performance plus four (4) option years. Currently, the same support is procured under Contract N00019-09-D-0001, which is a sole-source contract awarded to the same company. Rolls-Royce PLC, Filton, PO Box 3, Postal Code BS34 7QE, UK&nbsp;is the only source which can provide these services because it is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the F405-RR-401 Adour Engine and Components. The estimated value of this contract is $25,500,000.00.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />For<br />U.S. Marine Corps Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS)<br />System Sustainment</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation for applications or an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of that information. This is a request for market research for information purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposal. As such, it should not be considered as a commitment on the part of the Government. Pursuant to FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Vendors/interested parties are solely responsible for all costs and expenses associated with their respective response to this RFI. Industry responses to this market research request are placed on notice that any information received by the Government does not ensure participation in any planned/anticipated future solicitations or contract awards.</p>
<p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>This RFI is to gather information as part of a market survey to determine the availability of sources able to provide software sustainment and post production life cycle software support of the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) system baseline.</p>
<p>TBMCS is a U.S. Air Force lead program, with joint interest. TBMCS serves as the focal point for Joint air warfare command and control, integrating systems for planning, tasking, intelligence-gathering and execution into a single, common interface. It is the primary system for planning, managing and executing the air battle, feeding real-time, decision-quality information to users from the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) and the staff at the Air Operations Command (AOC) to pilots, navigators, and weapons control officers on the battlefield. TBMCS links the command and control systems for the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), and United States Marine Corps (USMC), and integrates with ground systems for the Army systems, enabling coordinated, synchronized air battle management. The program is post Milestone C and in sustainment. Sustainment is currently being performed by Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Solutions (IS&amp;GS) at their Colorado Springs, CO facility, and Hill Air Force Base (AFB), UT. The Government is not capable of providing additional Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for this effort due to fiscal constraints and without causing a break in existing software sustainment efforts at LM IS&amp;GS. TBMCS software is approximately 5 million total source lines of code, made up of various programming languages (ADA, Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), C, C++, Perl, Unix Shell Scripts, SQL, Ant, Batch Code, Visual Basic, and AWK). Additionally, it utilizes multiple specific compilers and libraries for legacy UNIX applications which include Sun C++ compiler, Forte Developer 7 C++ 5.4 2002/03/09, Sun C compiler, Forte Developer 7 C 5.4 2002/03/09, KL Group XRT Table v2.2.1, Field v1.1.0, Gear widgets, v2.0.1, etc. Operating systems include Solaris 8, Solaris 10, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003/2008, with middleware consisting of Oracle 9i/11g, Oracle Weblogic Server 9.2/10.3, Systematic IRIS, and Java Runtime Environment 1.6. TBMCS Unix applications are Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) compliant with sustainment actions required to be able to maintain that DII COE baseline for interoperability and Information Assurance. USMC sustainment efforts will have to be integrated with USAF/Joint sustainment efforts in order to maintain interoperability with the USAF/USN TBMCS baseline. The USMC sustainment support must be able to be accomplished without compromising joint TBMCS performance and functionality, and without compromising the Information Assurance posture of the system. The intent is to not only sustain the USMC baseline, but increase the Information Assurance posture of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:<br /></strong>The USMC is requesting information from industry sources that have systems development and integration and hardware/software engineering experience in the sustainment of products that include tactical Command and Control (C2) applications which include the integration of hardware/software updates required to maintain fielded system capabilities from a capabilities and information assurance perspective. Respondents are requested to provide information specifically on the following:</p>
<p>a. Evidence of competent systems engineering and integration experience that includes both legacy and engineering integration of web-based applications (first and second generation) and service inventories and deployment in the sustainment of TBMCS software and software languages; or equivalent C2 software and proficiency in the various TBMCS software languages (i.e., ADA, J2EE, C, C++, Perl, Unix Shell Scripts, SQL, Ant, Batch Code, Visual Basic, AWK), operating systems (Solaris 8, Solaris 10, Windows 2000/2003/2008/XP, DII COE 3Z) and middleware (Sun Java Runtime Environment 1.6, Oracle 9i/11g, Oracle WebLogic Server 9.2/10.3, Systematic IRIS), Apache Web Server and COTS application (Microsoft Office 2003, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox).</p>
<p>b. Evidence of competence in implementing Information Assurance in relation to Web and Solaris-based and DII COE based architectures for multiple security level domains from unclassified through Secret (with desirable understanding of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)), including Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) processes.</p>
<p>c. Demonstrated knowledge of and capability to support fielded software maintenance including a Tier II 24-Hour Help Desk, urgent maintenance, fixes, documentation, and contingency support for TBMCS. The support will include technical expertise and assistance on questions and issues related to TBMCS fielded systems, system patches, service packs, real-world contingencies, exercises, and testing. This support will require the availability of a secret classified lab configuration capable of addressing the USMC TBMCS fielded baselines, and interoperability with the USAF and USN TBMCS baselines, and all requisite system interfaces.</p>
<p>d. Capability to integrate and assume software maintenance responsibility for any other software code base not originally developed by your organization (i.e., third party software), but of similar complexity and scope to that of the TBMCS system.</p>
<p>e. Minimum Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 compliance in the respective business unit and process controls to ensure that work performed by subcontractors is consistent with CMMI Level 3.</p>
<p>f. Demonstration of understanding of Joint Interoperability of C2 systems.</p>
<p>g. Understanding of the Air Operations Center and the Tactical Air Command Center TBMCS operations and challenges.</p>
<p>h. Capability to perform testing/regression testing and to resolve hardware/software issues resulting from baseline changes in fielded systems (i.e., Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs), Technical Change Notification Orders (TCNOs), and Group Policy Objects (GPO) upgrades.</p>
<p>i. Availability of resources to sustain large scale, software intensive fielded systems, including but not limited to:<br /><br />(1) Qualified Staff with proper clearances for selected key personnel at time of award.<br />(2) Adequate facilities, including labs, for analyses and testing (which includes classified communication capabilities) to maintain system baselines.</p>
<p>j. Demonstration of an understanding of net-centric data/service exposure.</p>
<p>k. Demonstration and familiarity with DoD Community of Interest (COI) processes, relevant COI schemas and specifications (e.g., the Air Operations COI (AO COI) schemas)), and overall data registration and discovery processes.</p>
<p>l. Demonstration of proficiency in business process modeling/management (BPM), electronic workflow, and service orchestration.</p>
<p>m. Evidence of understanding the Net-Centric Data Strategy, Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI), Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA).</p>
<p>n. Demonstrated ability to perform Releasability Analysis.</p>
<p>o. Evidence to perform TBMCS sustainment and sustainment transfer activities with no break in service to the end user (Warfighter).</p>

<DESC>Ref solicitation DARPA-BAA-12-25.<br /><br />The META-X Toolset is being developed to support component-based design of complex cyberphysical systems.  These systems include military vehicles, as exemplified by the systems defined by the requirements for the FANG Competition.  The tools implement a set of concepts formulated under the META and AVM program to dramatically reduce the cost and schedule required to achieve the first limited production of a target vehicle.
<p>The META tools have been under development since late 2010, with a number of performers, narrowed down to 3 integrated tool chains.  This effort extends the work to mature and evolve the Vanderbilt efforts from META Language FA8650-10-C-7075 and META Design Flow FA8650-10-C-7082 contracts.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is for the repair order N00383-13-M-066D. The order covers the repair of 1 Power Supply (NSN: 7RE 6130 012429714 SF, P/N: 3515400-40). Raytheon Technical Services Co. (CAGE: 072E5) is the only approved source to repair.

The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

						"	This Is a reference to the part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that allows an Item to be purchased without being fully competed. This statement serves as a point of reference in case the justification is questioned In this case, It would bo reviewed for its relativity to this pail of the Federal Acquisition Regulation	"		"	
																						
																						
7. NATURE & BACKGROUND OF ACQUISITION TO JUSTIFY SOLE SOURCE: The VA Ann Arbor HS does not have the equipment or expertise to perform the procedures required for this VA funded study.The 3-T MR.VMRS scanner that resides at the U of M Medical Center is required to gather data about the structure and chemistry of the brain. Specialized MR software and hardware, as well as appropriate physics/technical support are required for Image acquisition and post-processing and analysis of Images, which (hell of M Medical Center possesses. No other local source possesses this specialized equipment.
"	Describe the minimum salient characteristics that will meet your needs, This Is the area where you explain why no other vendor anywhere can supply this requirement for you. Acceptable reasons for 'sole source include (but are not limited to): bound by contract, technical order spectfication, warranty service. Of regional standardization. If the reason for sole source is determined locally, offer what market research or clinical guidelines led to the decision. If this item is included in an allowance standard for War Reserve Materiel (WRM), cite the allowance standard, required source, and stock number for this Item. NOTE FOR WRM PURCHASES: The Defense Logistics Agency is your primary source for WRM equipment. Be sure to determine availability from a DLA Item manager before contracting for WRM equipment. If DLA cannot meet your timelines for WRM equipment. your urgency may be further justification for other than full and open competition. See your Medical Logistics Flight Commander for more details.
8, PROVIDE INFORMATION SHOWING MARKET RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED: The AAVAMC and the
University of Michigan have an invaluable partnership. The University contains a state-of-the-art 3T MR scanner that can best acquire the protocol-specific scans for this initiatIve.The established partnership allows for the VA patients to be better served at the University than at any other local Institution.
"	This justification is for why no other vendor anywhere can supply your item or service and still meet your needs Your rationale for barring other vendors is crucial to your justification. If you already cited the statutory
 
o

9. PRICE ANALYSIS 'FAIR AND REASONABLE': The price per scan is 9675; there will be 170 subjects scanned In elf, for a total of $114,750.
"	This section is mandatory. Do not leave this section blank. Even though this must be purchased from only one source, you must still obtain a quote from the vendor for this purchase. This way you are able to verify added costs for delivery. your geographic region, or installation. Cite the pricing here. If you purchased this Item before, compare this price to what you paid last time. Cite this here as well.
r--- 10. LISTINCi OF SOURCES EXPRESSING INTEREST IN MIS REQUIREMENT: NIA
"	Enter or attach contact information for sources you cited In the description of your source selection. if sole source by statute, regulation. or standard, fist contact information for that source here.
I I. FUTURE IRE ACTION I'D OVERCOME HARRIER 'ID OTEOC: The partnership that exists between the U of M Medical Center and the AAVAMC justifies the use of this singular source in this instance.
"	Thls section fulfills the legal requirement to affirm that the selection oll a singular source for this requirement is an anomaly and that action will be taken in the future to ensure full competition in the future. The reason this is needed Is to describe how the government will make an effort In the future to fully comply with standard acquisition practices and not resort to creating unnecessary partnerships with lew vendors at the risk barring full competition to circumvent the FAR. By signing this, you are telling the contracting officer to avoid the processes that assure best value and fairness In this acquisition.

These services are provided for the USARC currently at nineteen (19) various CONUS locations in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN), Pre-deployment training, Unit Status Reporting (USR), and transformation in the Army Reserve.  These are professional, non-personal management, property accountability and readiness reporting support services to the USARC IAW the existing Performance Work Statement (PWS) utilizing multiple logistics systems.  The MMT support allows the distribution of equipment between units and wholesale, which improves logistical readiness through redistribution of those assets, and improves deploying units' readiness.
