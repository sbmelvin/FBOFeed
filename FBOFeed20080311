<CONTACT>ANN MANNING CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3034452433     AMANNING@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a sole source procurement to the National Academy of Sciences (quasi Government agency) to execute an independent study to evaluate technical concerns addressing ductile iron pipe coatings identified in Table 2 of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Technical Memorandum 8140-CC-2004-1.   The 2003 House Committee on Appropriations Report directed Reclamation to study its corrosion criteria.  After an extensive review of technical/performance data and review by an independent consultant review panel, Reclamation published its findings and recommendations in Technical Memorandum No. 8140-CC-2004-1, "Corrosion Considerations for Buried Metallic Water Pipe", dated July, 2004.   During the development of the Technical Memorandum No. 8140-CC-2004-1, "Corrosion Considerations for Buried Metallic Water Pipe", dated July, 2004, Reclamation found that the effectiveness of polyethylene encasement (PE) has been the subject of intense debate within the ductile iron pipe and corrosion industries for years.  Reclamation continues to have technical concerns regarding corrosion control and mitigation of corrosion on ductile iron pipe; and its position is reinforced by questions regarding the appropriateness of the statistical analysis of the data from DIPRA's test bed program.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can execute the scope and direction of this study.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide similar requirements must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541690 which is $6.5 Million.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page and the Navy Electronic Commerce On-Line (NECO) site. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet.  NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  The Specialty Center Acquisition NAVFAC (SCAN) office in Port Hueneme, CA intends to award up to five, indefinite-quantity, indefinite-delivery (IDIQ), fixed-price multiple award contracts using a best value competitive source selection process. Successful contract awardees will be given a fair opportunity to compete on all task orders.  There will be no pre-established firm-fixed contract prices. The actual work to be performed will be described in written task orders to be issued as needed by the Contracting Officer. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for design, procurement, installation, testing, and sustainment of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and associated sy!  stems at various U.S. Navy and Marine Corps facilities, worldwide, in support of EPACT 2005.  This acquisition includes advanced metering for electric, gas, steam, and water commodities.   The North American Industry Code Standard is 238210 and the annual size standard is $13 million. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program applies and competition is unrestricted. The basic contract period will be for one year. Each contract contains four (4) one-year option periods for a total maximum duration of five years. The total maximum value for the base term and all options for the aggregate sum of all IDIQ contracts will not exceed $250,000,000. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered under the performance period of the contract. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract without discussions. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The RFP will be posted on the website at www.neco.navy.mil on or about 03/24/08.  No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO T!  HIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register on the NECO website.  Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the Internet website address listed above. Request for Proposal number is N62583-08-R-0051.  For questions please contact the POC below.  The Government intends to award the following three sample tasks simultaneously with award of the basic contracts, subject to the availability of funds.  Offerors are encouraged to participate in the site visits described below.  The Government will not pay for proposals or costs associated with proposal preparation, including participation in the site visits.   Anticipated contract/task order award date is on or before 9/30/08. Sample Task 1 - Performance location is Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) in California.  NBVC consists of Navy installations at Port Hueneme, Point Mugu, and San Nicolas Island.  These locations are diverse in that the facilities involved support a deepwater harbor, an airfield, and an island installation.  A viable AMI site design has been developed for NBVC and is approximately 90% complete. The scope of Sample Task 1 is the procurement, installation, training, and sustainment of the existing site design, including all metering and communications components.  It is expected that very little, if any, modification will be required of the design.  The approximate combined total numbers of required metering end-points, for the commodities electricity, gas, water, and steam, are 265, 35, 60, and 1, respectively.  San Nicolas Island does not have any projected gas metering requirements, and the current requirement for steam metering is limited to a single power plant at the Port!   Hueneme installation.  The current site design prescribes comprehensive data collection through a system of approximately 20 RF data collector components, using unlicensed 900 MHz and 2400 MHz spectrum, with localized meter communications being accomplished through twisted pair and Ethernet connections.  A site visit is planned at Port Hueneme, CA on or about 04/15/08.   Sample Task 2 ? Performance locations are at Naval installations on the island of Guam.  Naval Base Guam (NBG) is the most significant of these installations, and includes the Apra Harbor Naval Complex and the Ordnance Annex on the southwest portion of the island.  Also included in this effort are the Naval Hospital, the Sasa Valley and Tenjo Vista Tank Farms, and Naval Computer & Telecommunications Stations (NCTS) Finegayan and Barrigada.  The locations involved are geographically distinct, but are in close proximity due to the small size of the island (Guam is approximately 30 miles in its longest dimension).  A site survey recently conducted showed the Navy to have approximately 720 buildings at the installations involved, of which about 500 already have some forms of non-advanced metering.  Due to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, the only commodities typically used on Guam are electricity and water, and very little gas or steam metering requirements are anticipa!  ted.  Electricity is provided through Guam Power Authority (GPA), a public utility service.  Installations are particularly susceptible to extreme weather, due to the island?s location, and construction must generally be capable of withstanding super typhoons having sustained wind speeds of over 120 knots.  A site visit is planned on or about 04/21/08 at NBG.   Sample Task 3 ? Performance locations are Naval Air Station Sigonella (NAS Sigonella) and Naval Support Activity Naples (NSA Naples) in Italy.  NSA Naples consists of four locations, including a main installation at Capodichino and a support site at Gricignano.  There are approximately 69 buildings at the Capodichino site, with a variety of potential electrical, water, and gas meter endpoints.  Although there are about 25 buildings at the Gricignano site, also with electrical, water, and gas services, the majority of the buildings are leased and not included.  Two additional sites under the purview of NSA Naples consist of a recreation site called Carney Park and a SATCOM communications site, each with minimal facilities (less than five buildings each), and requiring metering of electricity and water only.  Capodichino is approximately 12 miles from Gricignano.  Water is supplied to each installation by the local utility service, although a Navy water treatment plant is used!   at Capodichino to regulate water quality. NAS Sigonella consists of three locations: NAS I, a site with approximately 53 buildings that utilize a combination of electricity, water, and gas services; NAS II, a site with approximately 135 buildings serviced by only electricity and water; and a communications site with minimal facilities, also utilizing only electricity and water utilities.  NAS I is about 7 miles from NAS II, and nearly 12 miles from the communications site.  NAS I and NAS II water services are derived from 2 and 3 water wells, respectively, which are piped in from off-site.  Electrical power is derived from the local utility service, Ente Nazionale per l'Elergia Elettrica (ENEL), at all sites.  Site visits are planned on or about 04/28/08 at NSA Naples and 05/1/08 at NAS Sigonella to aid offerors in proposal development.   The Government intends to award the three sample tasks simultaneously with the proposed contract award prior to 09/30/08 contingent upon funding availability.  More detailed information concerning each sample task will be provided in the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The Behavioral and Rehabilitation Technology Branch, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Tuscana Data Authority in Italy.  The purpose of the contract is to create a rehabilitation research data resource entitled Community Assessment Rehabilitation Experiment (CARE).  A pilot study to examine adaptive physical activity was initiated by the Instituto Superiore di Sanita as part of the research project ?Obtaining Optimal Functional Recovery and Efficient Managed Care for the Chronic Stroke Population? within the framework of the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and Italy?s Ministry of Health.  The study included a community intervention program that was initiated in the Tuscan Region by Dr. Francesco Benvenuti and Dr. Laura Tramonti.  The program?s impact included safety of the intervention, improvement of gait and balance function and reduction in participants? depression.  Community access remains a key issue in translating research results of individuals with chronic conditions who have participated in an exercise regime.  The pilot provided an important step in translating the growing evidence regarding the health benefits of exercise for stroke survivors into a sustainable community model that was safe, feasible and efficacious in improving walking speed, and community ambulation.  The intervention program demonstrated it has the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs associated with chronic stroke in an aging population through reducing cardiovascular risk factors associated with a sedentary lifestyle.  However, confirmation of the reduction of costs in health care will require implementation of a community intervention program on a large scale.  There are approximately 2,500 individuals in the Tuscan Region who suffer a stroke annually who would be eligible to participate in an expanded study.  The Tuscan Region Data Center completed a pilot study with 40 individuals in the intervention group and 38 individuals in the control group; it will serve as a model to be expanded.  The effort involves leaders of several different groups including: Tuscana predictive and preventive medicine (Andrea Leto); Technology Assessment Office (Alessandro Reggiani); Scuola Superiore Universitaria Sant? Anna of Pisa (Sabrina Nuti); and the  Dipartimento Technologie e Salute (Velio Macellari) lead by Dr. Laura Tramonti, General Director of the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Region Toscana.  The Tuscana Data Authority has the experience and necessary affiliations to obtain the data sets.  They have completed a pilot study demonstrating applicable data management necessary to link the elements that are required to accomplish the rehabilitation data resource.  In addition, the group has developed proprietary software to organize the data.  The purpose of the proposed project is to expand this pilot into a computerized rehabilitation research data base that will link separate rehabilitation data components such as pre and post health measures of individuals with a chronic condition (e.g., stroke or back pain, etc.) participating in low cost interventions (e.g. adaptive physical activity) in the community with health services and drug utilization information.  Expanded support from NICHD will include study components such as, 1) Establishment of a small Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC); 2) expansion of an existing computer based information system; 3) translation of  a standardized outcome measure  (e.g. SIS, PROMIS); 4) implementation of a telephone interview in the Tuscan region; 5) creation of a patient data file; and, 6) support for collaborative interactions for individuals with chronic conditions. If there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), HHSAR 306.302-1(a) (2) (ii) A and B.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service in Pendleton has a requirement for a new or used high-wheeled, self propelled sprayer for application of liquid farm chemicals.  This equipment will be used in support of data collection activities for (1) large-plot tillage research investigating changes in soil biochemical properties with a change from conventional wheat-fallow cropping to highly productive perennial grass production, and (2) field-scale research of relationships between crop spectral reflectance properties and crop N, leaf chlorophyll, or grain protein content.  In small plot research, the wheel-base of the sprayer will be widened to clear 12-ft plots, and it will be high enough to clear taller crops.  In field research, optical sensors will be mounted in front of the sprayer for sensing the light reflected and heat emitted from the crop.  The sensors will be operated at the same time the sprayer is used to apply chemicals to the crop.  A used Spra-Coupe 3000 Series sprayer manufactured by Spra-Coupe will meet the needs of the above research.  Features used with less than 2500 hours of operation. Four wheel. Diesel powered, two wheel drive, cab with A/C. Wheelbase extendable to 12-ft, platform extendable to 6-ft. 60-ft foldable spray boom. Operating spray system (pump, tank, flow rate controller, spray boom, nozzles). In good mechanical condition and field ready.  Other manufacturers products will be considered on an or equal basis to the above. RFQ?s attached.  Due to the nature of used equipment we can only post this requirement for two days.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit RFQ's by the closing date of 3-13-2008 4:00PM PST.  Responses can be presented by Fax or email photo?s required.  Return SF18 form completed

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), of South Korea, for the acquisition of Big Items for Calculable Capacitor System to be used by the Quantum Electrical Metrology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the collaboration which will allow KRISS and NIST to reduce the cost of developing calculable capacitors. NIST focuses on developing the tunable-laser-based Fabry-Perot interferometer, while KRISS focuses on computer simulations and fabrication of the mechanical structure of the calculable capacitor. This purchase will allow KRISS to supply NIST all the key mechanical components, which can then be assembled at NIST for a new calculable capacitor.  Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), South Korea and NIST have collaborated over the last few years on exploring the possibility to build a transportable, automated calculable capacitor using a tunable-laser-based Fabry-Perot interferometer. A calculable capacitor provides the link between an electrical unit and a mechanical unit and also serves as the primary standard for capacitance calibrations. However, calculable capacitors are not commercially available and have been designed and constructed only at National Metrology Institutes.  Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required items for the calculable capacitor system.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by March 26, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Savillex, Corporation, Minnetonka, Minnesota, for the purchase of PFA Teflon Jars with Recessed Lids.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The 180 mL and 15mL PFA Teflon jars with recessed lids are used in continuing research projects at NIST that began in 1987 during the development of the National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank (NBSB).  The jars store tissues collected in the field for long-term archival (100+ years) and for contaminants analysis, both organic (PCB?s, PBDE?s, PAH?s, DDT?s, etc.) and inorganic (mercury, lead, arsenic, etc.) for all projects, including the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank, the Seabird Tissue Archival and Monitoring Project, the Health Assessment of Bottlenose Dolphins Project, and the American Peregrine Falcon Environmental Monitoring Project.  The jars must be made from PFA Teflon to prevent the organic materials leaching from the jar into the sample.  Since the beginning of the NBSB, NIST has tested samples that were stored in the Savillex PFA Teflon Jars over a period of years, and the samples have not been contaminated by the jars.  One of the goals of the NBSB is to provide samples that are collected and banked in a systematic and well documented manner for comparing results over time to identify whether environmental trends exist.  Therefore, NIST must use the same Teflon jars since the data proves that the jars to do not contaminate the samples.  Savillex Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the PFA Teflon Jars that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 26, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA, for the purchase of a Model UTSI50CC DC Driven Linear Stage.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in ?

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Precision Engineering Division at NIST currently uses a Newport Linear Stage system for their experimental setup.  The current system has a Newport XPS controller that is established to control the Newport Stage.  The stage controller is programmed for a Newport Stage communication code.  In order to maintain consistency and compatibility with the Division?s existing Stage system, the Division requires an additional Newport State system.  Newport Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 26, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland has a requirement for a Contractor to provide Pest and Rodent Control services.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to accomplish the surveillance, trapping, and pesticide application components of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program for SSA?s Main Complex buildings and other areas specified herein.  The IPM is a comprehensive process for achieving long term, environmentally sound pest suppression through the use of a wide variety of techniques.  The IPM includes not only the application of pesticides, but also encompasses structural and procedural modifications to reduce the food, water, harborage, and access used by pests.  The following SSA buildings are covered under this requirement: Altmeyer, Annex, East High and Low Rises, West High and Low Rises, Child Care Center, Operations and the Supply Building.  All of these buildings are located at 6401 Security Boulevard except for the Supply Building, which is located at 6301 Security Boulevard, and the Child Care Center, which is located on Perimeter Drive.  The Contractor is also responsible for the surrounding grounds of these buildings configuration and the sidewalks surrounding the Main Complex.  All Routine Pest and Rodent Control Services shall be conducted between Monday and Friday, excluding Federal Holidays, for all buildings unless otherwise authorized by the Project Officer.  Some services may be required to be performed after normal business hours (after 6 pm local standard time).  Additionally, the Contractor shall provide a weekly schedule for Non-Emergency, unscheduled inspections, pesticide application, baiting, trapping, etc. for specific offices and public space.  Service Calls for the SSA Main Complex range from 10 to 30 per week and shall be responded to within two (2) hours.  Emergency Services are also included in the requirement.  Contractors shall be capable of responding to requests for Emergency Services within four (4) hours.  The following pests are included: indoor populations of rats, mice, cockroaches, ants, flies, birds, bats, snakes, all vertebrates other than communal rodents, termites and other wood-destroying organisms, mosquitoes, secedes, pests that primarily feed on outdoor vegetation and other arthropod pests.  Any of the above pests located outside of the specified buildings, but within the property boundaries of the buildings, are included.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561710.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $6.5 million.  The SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract for this effort.  The period of performance will be for one year (12 months in duration) with four (4) 12-month option periods, if exercised.  This requirement will be procured utilizing procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 13.5 - Commercial Item Test Program.  It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about March 12, 2008.  The RFP will be issued under solicitation number SSA-RFP-08-1054.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The RFP has two alternative performance periods.  Offers may be submitted for either, or both, options.  Option 1, the contract performance period is from April 01, 2008, to Oct. 31, 2008.  Between April 01st and April 31st, Offeror shall: install the pressurized water tanks; cap the water lines from old water tank; and install a pressure switch in the control panel, so the water system is fully functional.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to include the following questions and answers raised by a potential vendor:  1. SAS hard drives are listed as required for the MSA1000. The MSA1000 uses SCSI drives only according to HP. Please clarify how to proceed. Answer: The SAS for drives was probably a typo (from being copied/pasted from another configuration). The drive interface for the MSA1000 is SCSI.  2. A X5345 processor was listed for the Database node DL380G5. There is no such processor, but there is an E5345. It?s the same speed as the request. Is that the processor requested? Answer: The E5345 CPU is fine. The intention was to list a recommended processor or equivalent (a little better or worse depending on the costs 3.  3. Are two DL380G5 required for each application cluster node and are two DL380G5 required for each database node in the configuration? Answer: There are four machines total, two applications nodes for the application cluster and two database nodes for the database cluster.  4. 4. The 36Gb SCSI hard drives are out of production according to HP. Are 72Gb 15K RPM drives acceptable? Answer: 72 GB drives or larger is fine. The number of drives and their configuration mirror or stripping with parity does not matter as long as the storage is redundant and that the minimum amount of logical storage is meeting. In addition, if larger drives are only available and that means that there will be more storage than the minimum amount, that is ok.  5. CL005: Rack mount Keyboard and Monitor what size monitor you need. Can we incorporate the KVM switch into the Rack Mount, monitor is this being used with the two servers and does the KMV need to be able to work with the Red Hat. Answer: The KVM switch and the monitor can be incorporated together, and it has to be able to to operate seamlessly with Red Hat. One monitor will be used for all. A 19 inch with little or no borders, or the next size down would be needed.  The date to send in responses is extended until Friday, March 14, 2008 at 2:00pm.

This procurement is for a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for commercial additions, major renovations, tenant finish, asbestos abatement, and general repair and alterations of federally owned and leased properties.

Awards will be made to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size stand of $31 million.  

This contract will have no pre-established fixed contract prices.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

__ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.
(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

*INFORMATION ITEM #10 HAS BEEN DELETED FROM PREVIOUS NOTICE*

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify businesses, in particular Small Business sources, (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the activities  required by the Medicaid Integrity Program provisions in the Deficit Reduction Act.  The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy.  

Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA Schedule contract.

Background:

Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by the Federal and State governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America??s poorest people.  

Within broad national guidelines governed by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State: (i) establishes its own eligibility standards, (ii) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services, (iii) sets the rate of payment for services, (iv) and administers its own program.  While State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, all States have chosen to participate.  The federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

In accordance with the statute, the Medicaid program by law is the payer of last resort.  Third party liability (TPL) refers to the legal obligation of third parties to pay all or some of the health care costs of Medicaid services provided under a State Plan.  Examples of third parties are:  private health insurers, employer-sponsored health insurance, Medicare, workers?? compensation, liability settlement, medical-support orders, long-term-care insurance, and estate recovery.  Billions of dollars each year are reported by states to CMS as Medicaid savings attributed to third party liability activities.  These programs are complex and include activities associated with the eligibility-determination process, claims-payment system, and reimbursement methodologies developed by state Medicaid programs.  The TPL policies and procedures are governed by both federal and state laws.

Section 6034 of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  Under this contract, MIP functions are to be performed by the MIC.  The MIP offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent overpayments.  It will also support the efforts of State Medicaid agencies through a combination of oversight and technical assistance.  While CMS has a wealth of experience in the financial management of the Medicaid program, the auditing of those who provide direct services to Medicaid beneficiaries has always been the responsibility of the States.  


The Education of Provider Medicaid Integrity Contractor (MIC) shall be prepared to provide Educational efforts or training that may take place in any State (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) that is receiving Federal funds under Medicaid.  The Contractor will be required to travel to all locations to which training is to be provided.  The Contactor will also be required to gather and / or create a compilation of all educational and training material into one or several training manuals/guides, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) guide, as appropriate.  All of the items above will be updated as the information becomes available and/or as appropriate.

Standard templates for educational materials and efforts in coordination with CMS to ensure consistency and branding of MIC educational efforts may also be required.  The Contractor may communicate with individuals and entities only after having received written approval from CMS.  An example of these communications may be, but not limited to, the following: CMS Website, CMS List server, Provider Partner Emails, Exhibits at association conferences, and national training calls.

CMS requests capability statements to this Sources Sought/RFI from particularly Small Businesses.  Based on the market research, CMS anticipates soliciting for multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  

The contractor will need to furnish the necessary services and qualified personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and supplies not specifically provided by the government under the terms of this requirement or as indicated in each individual Task Order. The Contractor will provide all the necessary resources required for performance as a full Contractor within 30 days from contract award and within 10 days of issuance of a Task Order for all tasks as may be identified, unless otherwise specified in each Task Order.

<DESC>The purpose of amending this notice is to correct the due date and email address for submissions.

*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of this plan, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic in the U.S. The office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these countermeasures, including the establishment of a stockpile of supplies to prevent or control the spread of pandemic influenza disease. This is a Request for Information (RFI) about parties with the interest and capabilities to perform certain pre-clinical testing of vaccine components in the BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpile.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.


*** OBJECTIVE *** As part of its preparations, HHS/ASPR/BARDA has established a stockpile of avian influenza vaccine antigens to be administered in a pandemic or pre-pandemic situation for the prevention of avian influenza disease. In order to extend the number of effective doses that can be provided from the stockpile, BARDA is also working with manufacturers to develop antigen-sparing technologies such as components that can be added to the vaccine to enhance its immune response, known as adjuvants.  In the event of a pandemic emergency, HHS would like to be able to extend the available stockpile of antigens by administering them with adjuvants depending on availability.  In order to have this ability, BARDA, in conjunction with NIH, CDC, and the antigen and adjuvant manufacturers, is planning to conduct clinical testing of possible antigen:adjuvant combinations, the results of which would be submitted to U.S. regulatory agencies as support for an Emergency Use Authorization.  A prerequisite for performing these clinical studies is the completion of GLP general toxicology testing of the investigational vaccine formulations to enable the filing of an IND to FDA. To conduct this testing, BARDA seeks qualified contract research organizations having the necessary capabilities and willingness to perform the studies. This is a request for such organizations to make themselves known to BARDA and provide information concerning their capabilities to perform the studies.  Please provide information concerning the following required capabilities. 


1.	Designing and conducting standard GLP general toxicology safety testing in rabbits according to protocols and standards sufficient to support the filing of an IND for clinical testing in humans

a.	Protocol design and execution
b.	Housing of animals in accredited facilities, administration of vaccine, 
c.	Observation and recording of animal welfare 
d.	Collection of sera 
e.	Clinical chemistry and immunological testing of sera
f.	Euthanasia by approved methods 
g.	Post-mortem histopathological analysis of test subject tissues 

2.	Mixing ad hoc of two vaccine components just prior to immunization according to procedure to be provided 

3.	Compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations for housing and experimental testing with lab animals

4.	Capacity for up to 90 rabbits for the duration of the study

5.	Availability to start in Dec07-Jan08 timeframe


Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. 
All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. 
Information must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on Oct. 26, 2007. Include the name, email address and telephone number of a primary contact point at your organization for this RFI in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification on the submitted information. Responses are limited to 2 pages.     
Your response to this RFI must be submitted electronically in .pdf format and emailed to schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov.  The type of business submitting the response (i.e., small business, large business, hub-zone, small and disadvantaged business, etc.) must be identified in your response.     If the service can be acquired on a GSA schedule, VA schedule, or other Government-wide acquisition vehicle, please supply the contract title and number, contract point of contact information and the name of the awarding agency.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is mandated by Congress under the 1992 FCSRCA with publishing an annual report of pregnancy success rates and embryo laboratory certification status and developing a model program for certification of embryo laboratories. Congress directed 1) all assisted reproductive technology (ART) clinics to report medical information on each patient, 2) CDC to analyze cycle specific clinic data, and 3) present it simply in an annual report so that the consumer has the ability to understand it in order to make informed decisions regarding the use of ART. In order to meet the requirements of the FCSRCA, CDC conducts surveillance of ART procedures performed in the U.S. and its territories.

The core tasks and minimum contractor requirements will include: 1)Track all clinics performing assisted reproductive technology (ART) in the U.S. and its territories in operation, closed or reorganized during the 2007-2011 data reporting years and provide an Excel spreadsheet listing of all clinics that performed ART and were required to report data under the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (FCSRCA) 2) Organize a team of two to three ART data validation specialists with previous experience with ART data validation activities to serve as data validation experts.  The vendor?s validation team shall attend meetings and participate in training for validation activities for the 2007-2011 data reporting years.  3) Provide CDC with data on the compliance of ART providers with professional guidelines and identify and measure indicators of quality of the practice of ART. 4) Organize a team of five to six experienced ART professionals and plan an annual in-person, meeting to discuss issues related to the collection and reporting of ART information and other related topics. 5) Establish an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Epidemiology Fellowship plan with yearly six month rotations at CDC. 6) Provide a lecture series on infertility and ART geared for CDC staff. 7) Develop and maintain a scientific exchange plan to allow CDC scientists to have learning experiences in collaboration with specialists in highly performing ART clinics or laboratories.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMOSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status. The NAICS code for this requirement is 813920.

<DESC>A.	General Information

The Southwest Region is standardizing for a possible multi-vendor award for Safety Scalpels and Blades. This is a 5 year re-evaluation of this product group. The region recognizes this is a specialized category in which vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes scalpel blades of various sizes (both safety and non-safety), knife handles of various sizes and lengths (reusable, disposable and surgical grade) and single unit safety blade/handle devices.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is Jun 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Your company must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of safety and non-safety, weighted and non-weighted scalpels and blades.  At a minimum, line must include blade sizes 10, 11, 12 and 15, reusable handle sizes 3, 3L, 4, and 4L, and disposable single unit blade/handle devices.    Please list the brands (both safety and non-safety), sizes of blades, and lengths of handles available from your company.  
2.	Your products must be available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health or you will be disqualified from the standardization process.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.
3.	Your company must have a DAPA number for this product line or you will be disqualified from the standardization process.  Please provide the DAPA number for this product line.
4.	Your company must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.  
5.	Educational tools or materials in the form of written, audio and/or visual must be provided for this product line.  Please state how your company will meet this requirement.  
6.	Your company must provide staff training for this product line.  Please state how your company will meet this requirement.  
7.	Please provide a list of product representatives for each account in the Southwest Region.
8.	Please provide your company?s returned goods policy.
9.	Please provide an implementation plan for servicing the supply requirements of the Southwest Region.
10.	Please annotate the hours that customer service support is accessible via a toll-free number.    24 hours/day, 7 days/week support is preferable.  If your company does not provide preferable level of support, state the hours support is provided.  
11.	Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects. If your company has not had any of the above, so state.
12.	Due to the increasing number of latex sensitive beneficiaries in our health system, our region requires latex-free versions of products in this product line where available.  Additionally, products must be clearly labeled as latex free.   
13.	Provide the brand(s) under which your company manufactures or distributes your products.
14.	Provide the size for each type of product and how the sizes are identified.  (The size and type [safety, non-safety] of scalpel must be easily identified from the packaging.)
15.	In the reusable knife handle category, a handle that is ?flash? or steam autoclavable is desired.  Please state whether or not your company can provide a handle that is steam autoclavable. 
16.	For safety products, the safety feature of the scalpel must be an integral part of the safety scalpel and not an accessory.  Please explain how your company?s products meet this requirement.  
17.	Handles have a slip-resistant feature.  Please explain how your company?s products meet this requirement.  
18.	The device cannot be reused once the safety feature is activated.  Please explain how your company?s products meet this requirement.  
19.	Blades must be able to be placed on the handle without touching the blade itself.  Please explain how your company?s products meet this requirement.  
20.	Blades must be able to be disengaged from the handle without touching the blade itself.  Please explain how your company?s products meet this requirement.  

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	Ergonomically designed, comfortable to hold.
2.	Device is lightweight when held.
3.	Device can be used in either hand.
4.	Activation of the safety feature is obvious and easily identified by the user.
5.	Safety mechanism can be activated using only one hand.
6.	Easy to use with minimal training required.
7.	Blade maintains its sharpness throughout use on the procedure.
8.	The safety device does not activate passively.
9.	Blade position is fully visible at all times on the sterile field.
10.	The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

6.	We require 24/7 product support. Describe how your company will do this.
7.	Your company is required to offer prices lower than your DAPA or you will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, national FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.
8.	We require your products to meet the FDA requirements for medical devices.
9.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
10.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Needleless Gravity Tubing & Accessories including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations, and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The tubing is easy to prime and back prime to eliminate the formation of air bubbles in the tubing and eliminate the risk of air emboli to the patient.
2.	The tubing supports needleless technology to comply with OSHA standards for needlestick prevention measures for health care workers to prevent contracting blood borne pathogens the patient may have.
3.	It is easy to remove air from the tubing even if connected to patient and eliminate the risk of air emboli to the patient.
4.	Accessories are compatible with each other and the tubing so the health care worker is able to assemble components without having to obtain specialty items.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  Failure to respond within the timeframe will result in disqualification. The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>A.	General Information

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Incontinences Supplies - Disposable Adult, Pediatric, Neonatal Diapers, Briefs, & Peripads.  The Region recognizes this is a category in which vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes disposable diapers for adult, pediatric and/or neonatal patient, mesh briefs, and peripads for adults.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is Jun 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incontinences Supplies - Disposable Adult, Pediatric, Neonatal Diapers, Briefs, & Peripads.  The product category includes disposable diapers for adult, pediatric and/or neonatal patients and mesh briefs and peripads for adults. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $72K ($34K for Pediatric & $38K for Adult). This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  This amount is only based on prime vendor sales. Purchase card transactions and direct procurement by the end-users are not reflected in this estimate so actual volume may increase for some categories. 

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.


C.	Instructions to Vendors 

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than April 2, 2008.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer. We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.
The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.

Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) is seeking General Contractors for construction of conventional facilities for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) project, which is to be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY 11973.

The NSLS-II will be an advanced, highly optimized third generation medium energy storage ring with full injection for top-off mode operation.  The x-ray brightness and flux of NSLS-II will be world leading, exceeding that of any other currently existing or under construction.  It will be 10,000 times brighter and have 10 times higher flux than the present NSLS.  NSLS-II will meet the nation?s need for a high brightness, medium energy x-ray source. It will enable structural studies of the smallest crystals in structural biology, provide a wide range of nanometer resolution probes for Nanoscience, enable coherent beam scattering studies of the dynamics of condensed matter systems, and enable new methods for imaging the structure of disordered materials and biological systems.

The NSLS-II will replace the existing NSLS which has served a large community of researchers and users for over 23 years.  The NSLS-II will be located in close proximity to the NSLS, to the south and east of the corner of Brookhaven Ave. and Grove Street.  The proposed site for the NSLS-II is a previously developed open field area with no known legacy of environmental contamination.  The site is level and reasonably proximate to BNL?s underground utility systems.

The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a Ring Building of approximately 350,000 square feet.  Additional small utility buildings may be required depending, on the ultimate design of utility systems.  

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of NSLS-II and will house the operations center, department offices, offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, the experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities.  

The proposed construction type for each building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior.  Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin, or membrane roof systems.  

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces.  Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines.  The NSLS-II project building has been designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces.  Additionally, the building design minimizes EMI and RFI fields in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator, and laboratory spaces by the routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment.   There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline, and certain laboratory spaces that will require HVAC system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

The NSLS-II location is proximate to BNL?s existing underground utility systems.  NSLS-II will be connected to BNL?s high voltage power distribution system, underground steam and condensate system, sanitary system, potable water system, telecommunication and data system, site-wide fire alarm system, and storm drainage system.  

The estimated cost for construction of conventional facilities is approximately $160,000,000 to $200,000,000. 

This is a Request for Submissions for the Qualification of Construction Firms interested in contracting for this work. ?General Contractors?, as used in this synopsis, is an association, joint venture, partnership, or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project construction.   Only firms responding to and meeting the minimum qualifications of this announcement will be eligible to receive BSA?s Request for Proposal for construction of the NSLS-II.   

This procurement is unrestricted. The purpose of this announcement is to identify qualified constructors with demonstrated experience in the construction of projects of similar scope and complexity. BSA will evaluate each firm based on the selection criteria set forth below.  

If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The plan is not required with this submittal.

Qualified constructors will be sent a Request for Proposal based on their demonstrated competence and the unique qualifications for the required work. Proposals will be evaluated on price and other factors set forth in the Request for Proposal.  A single firm-fixed-price contract will be awarded based upon a ?Best Value? determination and may be awarded to other than the lowest offer without discussions.

Qualification Criteria can be downloaded from this website.

<ARCHDATE>03112009
<CONTACT>ERIC K. NOLTE Contract Specialist 3039876977     eric_nolte@nps.gov;
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO DETERMINE AVAILABILITY OF INTERESTED CONTRACTORS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR QUOTATION OR PROPOSAL.  The purpose of this sources sought is to determine the availability of interested contractors to analyze the present NPS concessions workforce, and develop and implement a comprehensive human capital strategy and developmental plan that successfully addresses the needs of service wide concessions management.  Throughout the National Park Service, there are approximately 600 concession contracts constituting more than $800 million of business annually.  It is necessary, therefore, that the NPS make an appropriate investment in human capital in order to realize consistent, sustainable benefit to the government and the users of concessioner-provided services.  The overarching human capital goal is that a professional and well-trained workforce manages and implements the concession program at the field, regional, and headquarters levels. Achieving this goal requires a Service wide, outcome-oriented human capital strategy.  The NPS human capital strategy for concessions management focuses on recruiting, supporting, and promoting employees with the expertise and skills to accomplish the current objectives and long-term program goals.  This strategy is comprised of four principle components:  (1)Workforce analysis, (2) Competencies definition, (3) Organizational management planning, and (4) Training and development implementation.  The first component, is workforce analysis.  This analysis will include, among other things: the demographics of the present workforce; use of collateral-duty personnel and contractors; position descriptions and task assignments; and employee skills and job responsibilities.  The analysis will serve as the foundation for development of the subsequent components of the human capital strategy.  Successful management of the concession program requires that the workforce be unified in its business practices.  The competencies definition component of this strategy will identify the foundation skills required for concessions management as well as the tools for employee assessment.  The result will be selection of Office of Personnel Management-approved competencies to use in developing concessions management career field employees.  The next component will be the organizational management and planning.  This component will include an evaluation of workplace experiences, staffing standards, and supervision, among other human resource considerations. The service wide and programmatic concessions management organizational structure will be assessed along with a review of recruitment and retention efforts. A critical aspect of the human capital strategy is the implementation of the training and development component, occurring in tandem with the elements above. In working to close competencies skills gaps, the concessions management workforce will benefit from the assessment of existing training courses and the development of new instructional materials.  Interested contractors must possess a thorough understanding of the Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, the leasing provisions of 36 CFR, and National Park Service Director's Order 48A as they relate to concessions management staff and collateral duty personnel.  The NPS requests all interested parties submit information that addresses the following:  (1) Experience: The contractor must describe their experience of best practices in the application of hospitality management, business and financial management, resource management, asset and facility management, environmental stewardship, responsibilities for concession management, and related factors that affect the overall program. (2) Past Performance: The contractor is requested to provide past performance references relevant to Workforce Analysis, Competencies Definition, Organizational Management Planning, and Training and Development Implementation requirements as described above along with complete and current contact information (customer name, project name/contract number, address, contact name, phone number and email.  (3)  Small Business Status:  It is anticipated that the NAICS code for this acquisition will be 541612 with a small business size standard of $6.5M.  Contractors are required to submit their small business status with their response.  This sources sought request is due to the POC identified herein no later than April 10, 2008 close of business. Responses must be submitted electronically via email to the attention of Eric Nolte, Contract Specialist at eric_nolte@nps.gov, phone number 303-987-6977.  The response shall not exceed twenty (20) pages.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP.

<DESC>Laminar Flow Computer 

This request for information/sources sought announcement is issued to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a purchase of a Laminar Flow Computer. 
Laminar flow computers are part of the Air Force's Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) field-level gas flow working standard covering a flow range of approximately 0.001 to 2,000 SLPM. The laminar flow computer is coupled with one of eight different sized laminar flow elements (LFE) and through the laminar flow computer's integrated pressure transducers (absolute and differential) and temperature probe, can calculate flow rate based the actual flowing conditions and based on each LFE's calibration coefficients which are stored in the laminar flow computer. The current laminar flow computer is aging, and difficult to support due to lack of documentation and obsolete components. This acquisition will be to replace the current laminar flow computer with a modern, portable, and reliable laminar flow computer. The new laminar flow computer will have much of the same capability of the current laminar flow computer, e.g. one box solution that houses pressure transducers (20 psia and 15 in H2O), temperature probe, and digital display, no external computer required for full functionality, RS232, real-time density and standard condition corrections based on flowing conditions and test instrument type, etc.

<DESC>Sonic Gas Flow Calibrator Upgrade 

This request for information/sources sought announcement is issued to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a purchase of a Sonic Gas Flow Calibrator Upgrade. 
Sonic Gas Flow Calibrators (SGFC) are the Air Force's high gas flow calibration standard covering a flow range from approximately 0.01 SCFM to 250 SCFM (440 SCFM for the Air Force Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL)) through the use of approximately twenty-two sonic nozzles, automated and manual flow control, data acquisition and controlling hardware, and computer software. There are nine Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) SGFCs and one AFPSL SGFC. These SGFCs have been deployed since the late 1990's and the nozzles have not been calibrated since their initial calibration at the time of deployment. This acquisition will be to upgrade all of the SGFCs with new data acquisition and controlling hardware (maintaining both manual and automated flow control options) and computer software and software source code license. Data acquisition and control will most likely be required by a PXI embedded controller. Software will allow automated control and for easy calibration of various style flowmeters (e.g. rotameters, mass flowmeters) and it will make all necessary corrections for different style flowmeters, different reference temperatures and pressures, different gases, etc in a straight-forward manner (e.g. drop down selections and field entries). This acquisition will also fund calibration of each large nozzle bank up to 120 psia inlet pressure (nine nozzles at each PMEL ranging in diameter from approximately 0.05 to 0.41 inches (~1 to 250 SCFM), and ten nozzles at the AFPSL ranging in diameter from approximately 0.05 to 0.53 inches (~1 to 440 SCFM)) at a NVLAP accredited lab to approximately ?0.20% of flow reading. The remaining smaller nozzles will be calibrated at the AFPSL. All nozzle calibrations will be completed and returned to the appropriate PMEL prior to installation and training on the upgraded SGFC.  
The total estimated quantity is 10 Unit(s). 
Surplus or used material is not acceptable for this item. Offerors responding to this sources sought market research must (1) state whether they are a small or large business and indicate if your company is a small disadvantage or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small business; (2) advise what the longest period of time is that you can hold the quoted price; (3) advise if you have the item on a GSA schedule or other Government contract; (4) provide information concerning the technical capabilities of the product you are interested in offering, including commercial literature/brochures; (5) advise if you accept the Government purchase card; (6) any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess your firm?s capabilities; (7) provide point of contact and assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (9) advise how much time you would need to submit a technical proposal once the solicitation is issued; (10) provide an estimated price for one each of the unit you would be offering.

<CONTACT>Schuyler Eldridge, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-1554, Fax 202-205-4520, Email schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of this plan, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic in the U.S. The office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these countermeasures, including the establishment of a stockpile of supplies to prevent or control the spread of pandemic influenza disease. This is a Request for Information (RFI) about parties with the interest and capabilities to perform certain pre-clinical testing of vaccine components in the BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpile.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.


*** OBJECTIVE *** As part of its preparations, HHS/ASPR/BARDA has established a stockpile of avian influenza vaccine antigens to be administered in a pandemic or pre-pandemic situation for the prevention of avian influenza disease. In order to extend the number of effective doses that can be provided from the stockpile, BARDA is also working with manufacturers to develop antigen-sparing technologies such as components that can be added to the vaccine to enhance its immune response, known as adjuvants.  In the event of a pandemic emergency, HHS would like to be able to extend the available stockpile of antigens by administering them with adjuvants depending on availability.  In order to have this ability, BARDA, in conjunction with NIH, CDC, and the antigen and adjuvant manufacturers, is planning to conduct clinical testing of possible antigen:adjuvant combinations, the results of which would be submitted to U.S. regulatory agencies as support for an Emergency Use Authorization.  A prerequisite for performing these clinical studies is the completion of GLP general toxicology testing of the investigational vaccine formulations to enable the filing of an IND to FDA. To conduct this testing, BARDA seeks qualified contract research organizations having the necessary capabilities and willingness to perform the studies. This is a request for such organizations to make themselves known to BARDA and provide information concerning their capabilities to perform the studies.  Please provide information concerning the following required capabilities. 


1.	Designing and conducting standard GLP general toxicology safety testing in rabbits according to protocols and standards sufficient to support the filing of an IND for clinical testing in humans

a.	Protocol design and execution
b.	Housing of animals in accredited facilities, administration of vaccine, 
c.	Observation and recording of animal welfare 
d.	Collection of sera 
e.	Clinical chemistry and immunological testing of sera
f.	Euthanasia by approved methods 
g.	Post-mortem histopathological analysis of test subject tissues 

2.	Mixing ad hoc of two vaccine components just prior to immunization according to procedure to be provided 

3.	Compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations for housing and experimental testing with lab animals

4.	Capacity for up to 90 rabbits for the duration of the study

5.	Availability to start in Dec07-Jan08 timeframe


Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. 
All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. 
Information must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on Oct. 15, 2007. Include the name, email address and telephone number of a primary contact point at your organization for this RFI in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification on the submitted information. Responses are limited to 2 pages.     
Your response to this RFI must be submitted electronically in .pdf format and emailed to RFI-OPHEMC-07-01@hhs.gov.  The type of business submitting the response (i.e., small business, large business, hub-zone, small and disadvantaged business, etc.) must be identified in your response.     If the service can be acquired on a GSA schedule, VA schedule, or other Government-wide acquisition vehicle, please supply the contract title and number, contract point of contact information and the name of the awarding agency.

Returns shall be contingent upon the item being in resalable condition i.e. shrink-wrapped packages must not be opened, boxes must not be altered with any markings, and items will be returned in original box and/or packaging.  If the Contractor delivers a damaged or defective item, the Sandia Requester will exchange the item at no additional charge for a non-damaged or non-defective item regardless of value.

K.  INVENTORY 
    Inventory is not required.  However, if the Contractor chooses to maintain an inventory of frequently ordered items, upon completion or termination of this agreement, Sandia maintains no obligation to purchase any remaining, unordered, items.

O. Suspect/Counterfeit Parts - 
Suspect/Counterfeit Items (S/CI)
Suspect/counterfeit items or services are a serious concern to Sandia because they present a potential threat to personal safety, equipment and system reliability and/or compliance with regulatory environmental standards.  Failure of a safety or mission critical system due to an S/CI could also have security implications at DOE facilities. Notwithstanding other warranty provisions of this Contract, Contractor expressly warrants that all items provided under this Contract are suitable for the intended or specified use and that no suspect or suspect counterfeit items, component parts or materials have been furnished or delivered to Sandia under this Contract. Contractor's warranty also extends to labels and/or trademarks or logos affixed, or designed to be affixed, to items supplied or delivered to the Sandia. In the event that a suspect or suspect counterfeit item, as defined herein, is identified and/or delivered to Sandia, Contractor agrees to comply all requirements stated in this Clause.    

Definitions
Suspect Item:  A suspect item is an item in which there is an indication by visual inspection, testing, or other verifiable information, that the item may not conform to established U.S. Government or industry-accepted specifications and national consensus standards.

Suspect/Counterfeit Item:  A counterfeit item is an item that is suspected to be a copy or substitute without legal right or authority to do so, or its material, performance, characteristics or identity do not appear to be authentic and/or is knowingly misrepresented by the supplier, manufacturer or distributor.
	
Contractor shall only provide items and services that meet or exceed all requirements specified in this Contract including verifiable compliance with all applicable quality, safety and manufacturing standards including all U.S. Government or industry-accepted specifications codes and standards.  Examples of such manufacturing and/or testing standards include, but are not limited to: Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) Listing, National Fire Protection Association Approval, Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Approval, American Society for Testing Material (ASTM) Certification, Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Approvals Unless specifically stated otherwise, all items provided under this Contract, including all materials, parts and components shall be genuine, original, new, unused, and not otherwise refurbished, remanufactured, damaged or deteriorated.  

Types of material, parts, and components known to have been misrepresented include (but are not limited to) fasteners, hoisting, rigging, and lifting equipment; cranes, hoists, valves, pipe and fittings, electrical equipment and devices plate, bar, shapes, channel members, and other heat treated materials and structural items, welding rod and electrodes, and computer memory modules. Additional detailed information is available at the Department of Energy (DOE) Training Manual on Suspect/Counterfeit Awareness  http://hss.energy.gov/CSA/CSP/sci/SCI_TrainingManual_100306_rev5.pdf.  

Contractor is responsible to have a quality assurance program that detects and prevents suspect/counterfeit items from being furnished or used in the performance of work under this Contract. If requested by Sandia, Contractor shall furnish a certificate of compliance with delivery stating that all items fully comply with all requirements of this Contract.

In the event that the Contractor identifies or suspects that a suspect/counterfeit item may have been delivered under this Contract, Contractor shall immediately notify the Sandia Contracting Representative and the Sandia end-user or delegated representative identified in the Contract. Contractor shall document and provide all available information regarding any item or service furnished under this Contract that is suspected to be a suspect/counterfeit item, component, subcomponent part or material.  Sandia shall impound the item(s) and notify the local Department of Energy and will comply with all other applicable notification and reporting requirements. 

The Contractor may be required to replace such item(s) with item(s) acceptable to Sandia and shall be liable for all costs relating to the impoundment, removal, and replacement of the item(s). Contractor shall indemnify Sandia, its agents, and third parties for any financial loss, injury, or property damage resulting directly or indirectly from material, components, or parts that are not genuine, original, and unused, or not otherwise suitable for the intended purpose. This includes, but is not limited to, materials that are defective, suspect, or counterfeit; materials that have been provided under false pretenses; and materials or items that are materially altered, damaged, deteriorated, degraded, or result in product failure. 

Detection of any suspect or suspect/counterfeit item(s) leading to evidence of deliberate misrepresentation of any supplied item(s), including components, subcomponent parts or materials used in the item(s), may result in an investigation into the validity of certification, fraud, and/or forgery.  Because falsification of information or documentation may constitute criminal conduct, the Contractor will notify cognizant Department of Energy officials and the Office of the Inspector General.
. 
Note:  If this Contract provides for the use of credit cards, their use in no way relieves the Contractor from complying with all requirements of this Clause. (end)

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Shape Memory Polymer Hemodialysis Needle Adapter for End-Stage Renal Disease
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

Shape Memory Polymer Hemodialysis Needle Adapter for
End-Stage Renal Disease


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) Hemodialysis Needle Adapter for End-Stage Renal Disease.

Background: Hemodialysis continues to be the preferred treatment method for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).  The commercial kidney dialysis industry includes about 3,200 dialysis centers with combined annual revenues of $10 billion.  Complications resulting from arteriovenous (AV) graft failures account for over $1 billion per year.  A potential cause of graft failures is elevated hemodynamic stress introduced by the dialysis needle flow.

Description:  LLNL has developed a SMP adapter to tailor the fluid dynamics of the needle flow to reduce the hemodynamic stress in an AV graft. The adapter is deployed through the needle into the graft where it is actuated into an expanded shape using thermal energy.  The expanded adapter has a tube-like shape, in which the distal end has a larger cross-sectional area than that of the needle to decelerate the needle flow.  Upon completion of the dialysis session, the adapter is retracted through the needle.  The LLNL adapter is designed to reduce flow stress and, thus, hemolysis. The reduced stress may decrease vascular graft occlusion, which needs to be proven in pre-clinical and clinical trials. Go to: https://ipo.llnl.gov/technology/profile/announcement/ShapeMemoryPolymer.php
to view photos of the SMP Needle Adapter.

Advantages:  	
?	Reduces hemodynamic stress in shunts during dialysis
?	Adapter can accommodate complex shapes 
?	Can operate with multiple thermal activation methods

Development Status: 

Preliminary in vitro flow visualization measurements (see above images) and fluid dynamics simulations have been made using a graft model.  Animal and clinical studies are needed. A U.S. Provisional Patent Application covering the design of the SMP adapter has been filed.  A portfolio of background intellectual property is available.
 
LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPO website at http://ipo.llnl.gov/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Shape Memory Polymer Hemodialysis Needle Adapter for End-Stage Renal Disease
should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Industrial Partnerships Office
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 169-08

INTRODUCTION

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA. Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center in Tampa, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the ships and aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations critical to meeting NOAA's extensive mission.

BACKGROUND

OMAO has operated aircraft in support of the NOAA National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center and the Hurricane Research Division for several decades.  These mission flights are generally in support of the Hurricane Reconnaissance Mission and the Hurricane High Density Core Mission.  Since 1976, NOAA has operated two Lockheed WP-3D Orion aircraft to provide this support.  These missions provide life and property-saving products including tropical cyclone outlooks, forecasts, watches, warnings, and storm surge products for the U.S., twenty-four countries in the Americas and Caribbean, and the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern North Pacific Ocean.

NOAA seeks information on similar industry charter aircraft capabilities in support of the NOAA Aircraft Recapitalization Plan.

The overall program objectives are to improve hurricane track and intensity forecasts, increase the average lead-time for hurricane landfalls and improve hurricane wind speed forecasts through the collection of meteorological data within the hurricane environment.   To achieve these objectives, observations must be taken within the hurricane core including the geographic location of the hurricane center during specific synoptic periods (reconnaissance).  By obtaining high-density observations of the 3-dimensional structure of developing and mature tropical cyclones (high density core), NOAA can produce forecast products using the Hurricane Weather and Research Forecasting (HWRF) modeling tool.

DESCRIPTION and REQUIREMENTS

The aircraft flight profiles necessary to capture necessary airborne data requirements of these missions require flying into all regions of tropical cyclones up to Category 5 Hurricanes at various altitudes from 1500' up to and including the service ceiling of the aircraft.  These flights include hurricane eyewall and rainband penetration and flight within heavy convective activity.  Long range and long endurance capabilities are required to reach the target storm environment and still allow a minimum of four to six hours loiter time before returning to staging base.  

Subject aircraft must have the payload capacity and electrical-capacity (stated under Aircraft Requirements) to support four scientific data stations on each aircraft per flight and four associated mission personnel to operate these stations.
 
To complete NOAA hurricane research and reconnaissance requirements, the following aircraft performance and instrumentation, observational and availability specifications are required for each proposed aircraft:

<SUBJECT>R -- Game-based Learning Techniques
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development?s Office of Public and Indian Housing is seeking information from GSA MOBIS 874.4 vendors regarding game based learning techniques that can be applied to asset management.  The Department provides operating funds to over 3100 public housing agencies (PHAs) nationally that own and operate rental housing for eligible low income families.  With the publication of the Operating Fund rule on September 19, 2005, the Department is changing the business model for the public housing program from a PHA-centric model to an asset management model based on project based funding, accounting, budgeting, management and assessment.  PHAs require technical assistance and training to build the knowledge and skills needed to implement and administer the asset management business model.  To the maximum extent possible, the goal will be to provide training that can be accessed by PHAs on an as-needed basis.

It is anticipated that some or all of the training might be appropriate for game based learning.  The Department plans to use the GSA MOBIS 874.4 schedule to secure this contract.  Therefore, the Department is interested in receiving information and examples from vendors about their products and training concepts for adults to determine what game based training resources and services are available.   Submissions should be no more than 20 pages.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 28 March 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 26 March 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

STATEMENT OF WORK

RUNWAY RUBBER REMOVAL


1.	The work covered by this specification consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, materials, transportation, etc, that is required to remove 85-percent of the rubber buildup from 100-percent of the work area.  The work shall be performed on both asphalt and concrete surfaces.

2.	The rubber removal work shall be completed without damaging the pavement, joints, joint sealant, or any other government property.   If any damage does occur, the Contractor shall repair the damage as required, and in a manner approved by the Project Inspector.  

3.	Prior to the start of work, the Contractor shall attend an airfield safety briefing.  The Contractor shall follow all instructions given at this briefing.  If necessary, the Contractor will be provided with a radio at this time.  The Contractor shall return the radio at the end of the work.  The Contractor will also receive airfield passes for his vehicles at this time.

4.	The Contractor shall submit detailed information on the chemical composition of the product.  The Holloman AFB Environmental Flight will review the product to ensure that it meets all required regulations.  No product will be allowed for use on base until approval is received from the Environmental Flight.

5.	The equipment used for rubber removal work shall be mounted on pneumatic tires, and shall not cause damage to the pavement surface or joints.  The Contractor?s equipment shall also conform to the following requirements.  Experience has shown that these requirements are necessary in order to achieve a satisfactory end result.   

Broom for Scrubbing:  The broom fill shall consist of a steel and plastic bristle combination.  The minimum diameter of the broom core when new shall be no less than 30".  The core shall have a minimum of 700 pounds of wire bristles, and 100 pounds of plastic bristles. The minimum width of the broom core shall be 12'.  An all fiber broom will not be allowed.
	
Water Tanker for Rinsing:  The water pressure used for rinsing the pavement shall not exceed 50-psi.  The tanker shall have a minimum capacity of 8,000-gallons, and shall be capable of delivering rinse water at a minimum rate of 250-gallons per minute.  The discharge port shall be no less than 4" in diameter.

Chemical Applicator:  The chemical shall be applied with a low pressure sprayer.  The spray boom shall have a minimum width of 25'.  The nozzles shall be adjustable to prevent drifting of the chemical.

Magnet:  A magnet measuring at least 4" wide by 40" long shall be suspended beneath the rear of the broom to pick up any lost steel broom fibers.
  
6.	The removal of rubber deposits shall be accomplished by using a derubberizing compound specifically formulated and field tested for this purpose.  Typically, the areas to be cleaned are saturated with the cleaner, agitated by a mechanical scrubber using wire brushes, and rinsed with clean water.  The rubber removal chemical that will be specified for this contract is Avion 50, or approved equal.  Before an approved equal chemical will be allowed for use, it must be documented by field experience.  The contractor shall submit the names of at least five major civil airports or DoD bases where he has removed rubber successfully for at least two years using the proposed chemical.  The contractor shall provide a letter from at least three of the users stating that his work was satisfactory.  Holloman AFB may also require an on-site demonstration in addition to the above certification.  If an on-site demonstration is required, it shall be at no cost to the base.  

7.	The Contractor shall provide lighting as required.

8.	The Contractor shall begin work only when the air temperature is 40? F and rising, and when the pavement temperature is 35? F and rising.  

9.	Water will be provided to the Contractor at no cost.  The water source will be a fire hydrant located within the airfield.  The Contractor will be provided with a wrench for opening and closing the hydrant.  The wrench shall be returned when the work in complete.  When the hydrant is not in use by the Contractor, it shall be made available for emergency use by the base fire department.

10.	The Contractor will not be required to recover the chemical.  However, the Contractor shall flush all debris, waste, and by-products generated from the rubber removal process completely off of the pavement surface and onto the dirt.  The Contractor shall ensure that the dirty rinse water is not allowed to dry on the pavement and stain it.  If any rinse water stains do occur anywhere on the pavement surface, the Contractor shall clean the pavement until the stain is gone.  When cleaning is complete, there shall not be a dust film left behind on the pavement surface.  If any dust is present, the Contractor shall rinse the pavement until it is gone.  The Contractor shall also ensure that his rubber removal process does not discolor the pavement surface.  If any rinse water staining or discoloration does occur, the Contractor will be directed to stop work immediately and implement measures to correct the problem.   

11.	The work times and dates will be coordinated with the Contractor for each individual call.  However, the Contractor will generally not be allowed to work during the daytime hours on a normal workday.  The Contractor should expect that the work will occur during nights, weekends, or holidays.        

12.	The Contractor shall store his equipment and materials in areas designated by the base.  The storage area will be located somewhere within the airfield.

13.	Compliance with the 85-percent removal from 100-percent of the work area will be determined by direct testing within the designated work area.

13.1	A one square foot grid with 100 equal squares will be placed on the pavement surface at random locations.  The number of squares that contain rubber will then be counted.  The number of squares containing rubber deposits shall not exceed 15 in each of the randomly selected locations.    

13.2	Each work area designated for rubber removal will be divided into four equal zones for the purpose of compliance testing.  Within each zone, seven random, pre-selected locations will be evaluated.  Five of those locations will be located within 10' of the runway centerline.  At least six of the randomly selected areas within each zone must meet the requirement specified above.  Each zone will be evaluated independently.  A zone not meeting the 85-percent removal requirement shall be re-cleaned by the Contractor at his expense.

13.3	Deposits of rubber are defined as any surface deposit that can be removed by scratching the deposit with a sharp object (such as a pocket knife) without damaging the pavement surface.  Rubber stain is defined as materials in the pavement surface micro texture that cannot be removed without damaging the pavement surface.  Rubber stain is generally embedded in the surface of the pavement below the horizontal plane of the surface texture.   The Contractor will not be required to remove rubber stain.  Note that rubber stain is different from rinse water stain as defined in Paragraph 10.  (Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 97-17)

14.	The Contractor shall perform a complete cleanup of the work and equipment storage areas after the work is complete.  The Contractor shall ensure that no broom bristles are left on the runway.   

15.	The Contractor shall fill out the attached bid schedule.  There are two line items on the bid schedule.  One line item is for a trip charge, and one is for the rubber removal work.  The trip charge shall include all costs associated with travel, motel, per diem, etc, and all other costs not directly related to the rubber removal work.  The Contractor will be entitled to one (1) trip charge per call.  The rubber removal line item shall include only those costs directly related to the rubber removal work.  Payment to the Contractor shall be in accordance with the bid schedule.  The bid schedule prices shall include the appropriate tax.

16.	Prior to awarding the contract, the Contractor shall provide submittals on the proposed chemical and equipment that he intends to use on this contract.  The contract will be awarded only after the Contractor?s submittals have been approved.    

17.	Rubber removal work will generally take place on three runways.  The following information is provided.

?	Runway 16:  200' wide.  This runway is typically cleaned twice a year, and usually has heavy rubber buildup.
?	Runway 34:  150' wide.  This runway is typically cleaned once a year, and usually has light to moderate rubber buildup.
?	Runway 22:  300' wide.   This runway is typically cleaned once a year, and usually has light to moderate rubber buildup.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [  ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is 24 March 2008 ? 3:00PM local time.

Price quotation, technical proposal, evidence of certification to perform these services, and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 Alternate I must be submitted by one of the following methods:

(1) Mail to Defense Distribution Center Acquisition Operations (DDC-AB), Attn: Vonda DeBolt, J Avenue, Building 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070 or FedEx to same address.

(2) Fax:  717-770-7591 

(3) E-mail: Vonda.debolt@dla.mil

Failure to submit all the above requested information may result in the quotation being eliminated from consideration for award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SB3100-8057-3062.  

This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DCN 20080303 and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) current to Revision 5 and Proc Ltr. 2008-02 and FARS Dev. 2007-01.  The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions are available electronically from the following site: http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil        
    
This acquisition is a small business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333993 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The Defense Distribution Depot Albany (DDAG), GA has a requirement for one (1) Cold Seal Packaging machine in accordance with the following Statement of Work (SOW):

The contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, equipment, accessories, and material necessary to install the Cold Seal Packaging Machine. The flexible packaging process machines have been configured to feed rolls of cohesive packaging paper.  This is a double web machine that is equipped with an in-feed table.  This poly-coated laminate paper is USPS approved, printable, waterproof, tear resistant, and puncture resistant.  It has a special pressure-sensitive latex coating on the inner face that will only seal to itself, leaving no residue on the items packaged inside.  It can allow a bar code to be scanned and a labeler to apply the correct address label to the package on the exit conveyor.  The cold seal system is designed to form the cold seal package, address/label, weigh, post, and sort off the end of the machine in one continuous stream.  The cohesive material provides a big savings over padded and expansion-style envelopes and corrugated cartons.  The machines have a small footprint, so users can reduce the space necessary to handle their fulfillment and packaging.  The Cold Seal Packaging Machine should have the following requirements: 

1. In-feed belt with an 8? height and a 24? width capacity and capable of packaging

7. Power unwinds to assist in unrolling packaging spool. 
8. Capable of using poly type material with VCI (Vapor Corrosive Inhibiting) 
   chemical to inhibit rust for packaging processes.  
9. One inch packaging sealing.
10. Pneumatic spindles to facilitate easy roll changes. 
11. Basic spare parts kit. 
  
      Description of Contractor?s Tasks:
Task 1:	Equipment/Operator Manual (s) ? Provide after installation is completed.

FAR 52.212-1	Instructions to offerors-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition along with the followed addenda to this provision:

To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104.  

Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov 

The following provision is hereby added as an addendum to FAR 52.212-1:

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have satisfactory or neutral (in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for who information on past performance is not available) past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quotation has been determined acceptable ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.


1.  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the Cold Seal Packaging Machine  in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

FAR 52.212-3	Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items.  Offeror must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with their proposal or indicate that the registration has been completed at the ORCA website http://www.orca.bpn.gov.   Failure to include this information with the price proposal may render an offeror ineligible for award.

FAR 52.212-4	Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial applies to this acquisition. 

The following clause is hereby added as an addendum to FAR 52.212-4:

FAR 52.247-34 	F.O.B. Destination

BASIS FOR AWARD:   <BR><BR>"	This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Re gulation (FAR) Part 12, 13.5 and Part 15 as applicable.  The Government intends to make a single award for a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  The arrangement will consist of fixed price for labor based upon the fixed labor rates accepted by the Governmen t and reimbursement of travel and other direct costs on a no-fee basis.  The award will encompass the entire Scope of Work for the BPA.  No partial awards will be made. Offerors must propose to perform all task areas in the Overarching Scope of Work, Attac hment A.  In addition, the offeror must propose to perform all tasks in the Sample PWS, Attachment C.  Upon award the PWS Attachment C will be the first Order of the BPA.<BR>"	A BPA will be awarded to the offeror deemed responsible in accordance with FAR 9 .104, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the Solicitations requirements and is judged to represent the best value to the Government. <BR><BR>"	FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <BR>Is applicable to this evaluation process.   The  Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR>-  Offerors technical and management approach which includes an assessment of the offeror's understanding of the requirement, the offeror's approach to understanding the requirement and qualifications of the proposed personnel and t he Offeror's ability to meet schedule requirements<BR>-  The quality of the offeror's recent and relevant past performance <BR>-  Price<BR>The evaluation criteria above are listed in descending order of importance.  When combined, the technical and managem ent approach and past performance are significantly more important than price.  As non-priced factors reach equality, price becomes a significant factor.<BR>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all o ptions to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR><BR>"	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contra ct without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary.<B R> <BR>"	Past Performance:  Offeror must ensure 3 completed surveys are submitted as described (Attachment C, Page 3).  Past Performance shall be received by the submission date of proposals. Past Performance surveys must be emailed as stated above.  Past performance assessments, however not all encompassing, will be evaluated  in the areas of :<BR>?	Quality of Work<BR>?	Personnel<BR>?	Subcontractor Mgmt<BR>?	Business Relations<BR>?	Timeliness of Performance<BR>?	Customer Satisfaction<BR>?	Cost/Budget Contr ol<BR><BR>b.	EVALUATION APPROACH:  <BR><BR>The Government intends to evaluate and execute the PWS, Attachment C. as BPA Order 0001 and use the offerors solution as a means of evaluating the offerors ability to satisfy the requirement of this Order, in te rms of the technical and management approach in conjunction with past performance, and pricing matrix submission to determine the award of the BPA.  The best va lue will represent the offeror that demonstrates the ability to provide the best solution to the Order, considering the offerors understanding of the PWS and the offerors approach to satisfy the requirements, and qualifications of the personnel proposed to satisfy the Order, ability to satisfy the schedule and deliverable requirements, past performance as it relates to the Order and price.  Price will include the reasonableness of the price of the Order and the pricing matrix in Attachment D, to include l ocality adjustment factor(s).   Attachment D will be evaluated for the base ordering period and the optional ordering period.  The Government may award to other than the highest rated offeror when the price proposed by this offeror for Order 0001 and/or th e Price Matrix is determined to be unaffordable.<BR>III.

OBJECTIVES<BR><BR>This scope of work describes surveys for new Red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) cavity trees, new RCW start trees and pine flatt op trees.  For the purpose of this contract flattop pine is synonymous with old growth pine.  Old growth pine on Fort Bragg exists as scattered individual trees on uplands and individual or small groups of pines located in low lying areas or drains.  Old g rowth pines usually, but not always, have a large diameter, many have been boxed for resin production, may have 1 or more red-heart fungus conchs on the bowl, and virtually all have very large, often deformed branches.  These pines usually, but not always,  have a flat-topped appearance and are at least 150-175 years old.  This work is required to satisfy the Management Guidelines for the RCW on Army Installations.<BR><BR>2. LOCATIONS AND DESCRIPTION OF SURVEY AREA<BR>Approximately 22,000 acres are to be sur veyed during the base year and the three sequential option years, and 17,000 acres in the 4th option year.  The location for the base year acres consists of the area bounded by Southern Pines road, Sicily drop zone, Longstreet Rd. and the Little River.  Th e first option period area consists of southwestern Fort Bragg bounded by Raeford/Vass Rd. on the east, McPherson danger area on the north, and the west and south boundary of Fort Bragg. The second option period area will consist of the Northern Training A rea (NTA 1-8).  The location for the third option period consist the area bounded by Sicily drop zone, the main cantonment area, and Raeford/Vass Rd, excluding Coleman and MacRidge danger  zone.  The fourth option period area consists of the Northeastern T raining Area, the Main Cantonment area, and Camp Mackall.  Only 4,600 acres will be required for survey of longleaf pine flattop trees without cavities.  The specific mapped areas, to be surveyed during the base period, will be provided by the Endangered S pecies Branch (ESB) after contract award.<BR>TIMBERING OPERATIONS ACREAGE TO BE SURVEYED.  During the length of the contract, the government reserves to right to request areas to be surveyed ahead of all Timber Stand Improvements (TSI), Conversion Areas, P roject Operations, and Insect Infestation Areas.  The survey for RCW cavity/start trees satisfies the requirements of DA RCW Management Guidelines, ESMP, and RCW Recovery Plan.   The acreage will not exceed 3,000 acres for the base year or sequential optio ns years.  The government will require the contractor to begin surveying in the substituted area(s) no more than 2 weeks following written notification from the  Project Manager.  Written verification of oral requests for surveying of timber operation acreage shall be confirmed via electronic mail or facsimile by the Project Manager.  In no case shall the total contract acreage exceed the above base period and opt ion period acres as a result of Government substitution of acreage to be surveyed.  <BR><BR>3.  TASKS TO BE COMPLETED BY THE CONTRACTOR<BR>Task 1.  Survey for new RCW cavity trees on approximately 22,000 acres per year during the base year and the three se quential option years, and 17,000 acres in the 4th option year.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions.


Question: Will there be a DD254 and what are the requirements?
Question: Is a facility clearance required?
Question: Do you expect the interpreter to have security clearance prior to the commencement of the contract? If not, would you accept proposal with a qualified interpreter that could begin the security clearance process upon beginning of contract?

Answers: A DD Form 254 (facility clearance for the firm) will be required for contract award. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens and possess a minimum level Top Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance.

The individual presented for performance of services must pass a background check as determined by the U.S. Secret Service. All contractor personnel assigned to this contact shall meet the following minimum qualifications:

2. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens, and shall be required to possess a minimum level Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance.

4. Prior to award, the successful awardee shall be required to provide the name and contact information for the Contract Security Representative (CSR) of their firm. The CSR shall be the contact between the contractor and the USSS. The CSR shall handle all forms necessary to obtain security clearances and access approvals. 

Since Contractor personnel shall be required to have a Secret level clearance, the offeror must submit the following documents and others as required for each respective person immediately prior to award:
 
a. Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
b. SSF 3237 - Contractor Personnel Access Application (see Attachment 1)
c. SSF 4024 - Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (see Attachment 2) 
d. Provide evidence of the required security clearance for proposed personnel before beginning work. 
 
Question: Is sub-contracting allowed?
Answer: Subcontracting is permitted, but the resume and qualifications of each interpreter must be submitted with the proposal.

Question: Would the sub-contractor be required to have a facility clearance?
Answer: Yes, the clearance requirements apply both to the prime and subcontractor.

Question: Will you accept a proposal with a few interpreters that we feel may suit this type of requirement?
Answer: USSS encourages multiple interpreters; USSS must review resumes and qualifications of all relevant interpreters. The offeror may propose a bank or pool of cleared interpreters to ensure full time coverage of interpretation services.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions.

Question: For a number of the overlays, USSS states the dimension of the overlay and then: (picture target is actually 10.5 inch x 12 inch, need 5.5 inch at top to hang the target). Why does USSS need those extra inches at the top? Why only at the top?
Answer: USSS appreciates your question; the rquirement is as stated. If the offeror must take exception to the requirement, please identify that within your proposal.

Question: Is the delivery address of awarded contract the same address the samples are to be sent?
Answer: The address in the Solicitation is for mailing samples only. For calculating your quote, upon award, delivery will be to zip code 20708. As a reminder, the sample is to be shipped to (do not deviate from this exact address): 
Communications Center (RTC-Langan) 
245 Murray Drive, SW
Bldg T-5
Washington, DC 20223
 
Question: For the samples, since artwork is not available until award, what should be used?
Answer: USSS is providing pictures and sample targets. From the Solicitation:
  A word document containing pictures of each target (but not the backer) and JPEG files of each target will be provided upon email request; please provide your company name, point of contact and specify: pictures. 
  A full size sample target and a piece of the backer will be provided upon email request; please provide your company name, point of contact and postal mailing address and specify which target(s) and/or backer
 
Question: Line item 0001 has specific packing requirements, are there requirements for remaining items?
Answer: All of the targets should be boxed and shipped in flat boxes. Line item # 3 says boxed 100 per case, boxed flat. 100 is the minimum but they can be boxed up to 500 a box. USSS requires that each shipment be on one standard-sized pallet only, not multiple combined pallets. If two pallets are necessary, they cannot be combined.

Question: What can you tell me about probable shipping times and quantities so that I can come up with reasonable shipping costs?
Answer: USSS anticipates placing a Delivery Order for the minimum of each item within 30 days of award of the IDIQ. Should USSS exercise the option, then USSS will place a Delivery Order for the minimum of each item for that option year.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 03:
The following questions have been asked regarding this effort.  The questions and their respective answers are posted below.  Please note that, due to the number of questions asked, the due date for proposals has been pushed back from Wed, March 12 to Fri, March 14.  Proposals are due by 2:00 EST on March 14.

Q1: Is this a small business set-aside?
A1: This is NOT a small business set-aside.  All Microsoft-certified vendors may submit a proposal.

Q2: In review of the ExRAP and ADRAP requirements, it appears they are based on Microsoft Windows 2003.  The synopsis/solicitation mentions only Microsoft Windows 2000 in the SOW.  Will the contractor assist in the upgrade to MS 2003?
A2: The contractor may be asked to assist but will not be the primary responsible party. The Government has migrated portions of the infrastructure to 2003 already.

Q3: Paragraph B.5 of the SOW states the contractor shall assist the JCON PMO with the designing and planning of the JCONext architecture/infrastructure, as well as with strategy for the implementation of products.  Is JCONext currently being architected?
A3: Yes, by Government engineers and other on-site contractor engineers.

Q4: Can the Government provide a definition for the term Help Desk Level IV?
A4: Level IV Help Desk support is the highest escalation within our help desk model.  This occurs when our on-site engineers cannot determine the origin of a problem and/or how to fix a problem and need to directly contact engineers from the product's manufacturer.  These problems/fixes could impact one of our customers or many.

Q5: The lines in SOW Paragraph A, ?Background?, states the requirement includes ?as-needed? consultants.  If a company is Microsoft-certified, do they need additional certification in ExRAP or ADRAP to complete this project?
A5: This question will be answered shortly, information is still being obtained.

Q6. Can the Government provide more detail as to the LOE required for base plus options years?  The dollar value of $1.4M for base plus options years is not very high considering the services mention in the SOW Scope of Work.
A6. The value of the previous contract should not be construed as the appropriate level of effort for this contract.  The Government will not give a dollar or labor hour estimate for this effort, as it does not wish to restrict contractors to bidding to these estimates.  The contractors should use the effort described in the SOW and the user size given in Amendment 01 to this synopsis/solicitation.

_________________________________________________________________

<DESC>**Due date for proposals remains: 20 Feb 2008, 11:00 AM Local Alaska Time**

The following are contractor questions and Coast Guard provided responses:

Question 1) If we manufacture the shafts using ABS grade 2 forgings (ASTM-A-688) can we substitute this same material for the propeller nut and keys? Would 1045 material be acceptable?

Answer 1) If the shaft is manufactured of ABS grade 2 forgings (ASTM-A-688) then the same material shall be used for the propeller nut and keys.  ASTM 1045 is not acceptable.

Question 2) The key and keyway dimensions are not given on the drawing. 

Answer 2) Review of 167WAT-4301-10 shows detail 9-A and Section 8-C provides questioned dimensions.  This should be sufficient to prepare an accurate bid.  Upon award Coast Guard will work in cooperation with the Contractor to establish any additional details (not clear or deficient on drawing) required to complete fabrication.

Question 3) The propeller shaft in the original drawing (167WAT-4301-1) is a 1 piece shaft with a forged flange. Was this detail changed due to availability of material? 

Answer 3) Good observation.  The flange was removed in 1999, due to pitting/damage.  The adjoining stern tube shaft (that will remain in place) has been modified to use the existing straight coupling.  Coast Guard has intentionally decided to continue with a flangeless propeller shaft (as depicted in (167WAT-4301-10).

All other requirements remain unchanged.

Q: You list on the solicitation that it is 100% service disabled and the NAICS code is 336413. The problem I am having is with the code which is for other aircraft parts and equipment manufacturing. There are only 158 companies list in the CCR with both on these qualifications and they are almost all metal fabricators. I would like to quote direct but we are only a small vet owned so we need to go through someone else and would have a larger choice if you took off the NAICS code.
A: We have to stay with the NAICS code we have designated for this requirement; however, if a company does not have that NAICS code listed in their CCR but can provide "Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing" then they just need to add the NAICS code to their CCR. It does not take much time, it is just a matter of the company logging onto CCR and completing the steps.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address the questions/answers below.

1.What is the warranty period you wish provided with the units?
Industry standard

2.Do you require onsite service for the warranty or just parts replaced?
I want the service contract to include onsite service and parts.

Not really, but Ricoh's have worked well for us.

4.What is the projected delivery date you with to receive the product?
30 days from award.

5.Do you have existing units you are replacing the new units with and do you require them to be removed?
Two of them are replacing old copiers.     If a discount is available or could have the old models removed that would be good.

6.Regarding the question above, are you expecting some sort of credit for the removed copiers?
Not expecting it but it would be nice.

7.Would you accept refurbished units if the warranty period was the same, as refurbished units are usually more cost-effective purchases?
No.

8.Would you accept a 1%/15 calendar day prompt payment discount?
Yes. 

9.The RFQ specifies the 45 pages per minute unit have a 100-sheet document feeder.

Yes.

10.The RFQ specifies that each unit be equipped with a 3,000-sheet paper capacity.     Would a 2,700-sheet large paper capacity be acceptable?

INVOICE REQUIREMENTS Invoices shall be submitted per work order for services performed under this agreement.

Questions and Answers in reference to the Hearing Transcription Court Reporting Services solicitation  Question #1: Unable to register at http://www.vets100.cudenver.edu/ because of an apparent error that exists at this web site address.  Answer: Try using the email address below to get help with registration error issue or to get to a Customer Service Representative.  verify@VETS100.com Question #2: Company performs this type of work but never for the government and never in a "traveling" situation. Is actual travel to different sites to record the proceedings a required component for the transcription service provider? Answer: There is no travel involved for the vendor.  The Board accomplishes the recording of hearing proceedings. Question #3: As a transcription service for 14 years we have many client referrals but none that required exactly what seems to be needed here.  In your opinion, would that automatically disqualify us from being awarded a portion of this RFQ? Answer: A primary need of the Board is to receive quality transcripts from media devices that are provided.  Having 14 years of transcription service justifies the ability to perform the tasks. The Statement of Work clearly identifies all requirements. Question #4: Is there a template (or example) available that includes all the required components for a response to the RFQ?  Answer: Templates/examples will be provided via email request or to the awardee(s) at time of award. Question #5: Does the contracting company record the hearings for transcription? Answer: The contracting company does not record the hearings.  A media device is provided, via cassette tape or wav file (digital recording).  The company will have to access the BVA VPN Server to download the digital recordings.  Instructions on gaining access to the server will be provided once award is granted.
