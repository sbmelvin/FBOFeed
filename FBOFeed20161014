<SUBJECT>MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI):   CL-601 ADVANCED AVIONICS SUITE UPGRADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ICAO 2020 STANDARDS
<SOLNBR>25559
<RESPDATE>101416
<ARCHDATE>10282016
<CONTACT>Kathleen Islas, kathleen.d.islas@faa.gov, Phone: 405-954-8534

<a href="mailto:kathleen.d.islas@faa.gov">Click here to email Kathleen Islas</a>
<DESC>NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes to meet a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAâ€™s three (3) Bombardier CL-601 aircraft.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain approval for required Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) necessary to make these aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification will upgrade the current avionics suite and equipment (currently a 1995 version similar to that found on the Lear Jet 60 standard avionics suite configuration) to an FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics suite configuration in addition to meeting all 2020 ADS-B Out mandates and must include the following avionics systems:

  â€¢Future Air Navigation (FANS) 1/A with Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)
  â€¢R3 Global Positioning Systems (GPS) â€“ Install Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capable GPS
  â€¢Flight Management System (FMS) â€“ Introduction of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) AR 0.3 capability
  â€¢Weather Radar System â€“ Multi-scan Weather Radar
  â€¢ATC Transponder System â€“ Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B DO-260B) 

The FAA is open to all upgrades that provide the aircraft with the mandated 2020 avionics capabilities and requirements to enable them to fly anywhere in the world.  The FAA does prefer that a proposed upgrade is based on the ProLine 21 Avionics Suites with Advanced Avionics capability similar to that called out in Service Bulletins 605-34-019 and 605-00-003 Rev. 11; based on efficiencies from fleet standardization of aircraft systems.  The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on the first aircraft, taking into consideration the following

  â€¢Cost of engineering
  â€¢Time and cost of de-installation of old systems--taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new equipment
  â€¢Time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and
  â€¢Time and cost to obtain the required certifications and STCs to have the first aircraft flying fully certified.  

In addition to the Learjet 60 Avionics system installed on the FAAâ€™s CL-601 aircraft, the FAA has added additional modifications to the aircraft that may be impacted by the requirement to upgrade.  Some of the systems below will require the vendor to remove and replace with new updated avionics equipment/systems; new wiring; and cabling harness.  Other system listed below will stay on the aircraft but will require integration to work with the newly installed avionics equipment and systems.  A list of these supplemental modifications is shown below.  Those marked with (**) are systems that will stay on the aircraft after modification and may be required to interface with the new avionics systems to be installed:

  â€¢**Passenger Oxygen Systems -- SA5940SW thru Rev 01
  â€¢**AVIAC Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Systems -- ST00210WI thru Rev. B
  â€¢**Auxiliary Power System, .PAT, -- ST0033NY through Rev 02
  â€¢Collins ProLine 4 Avionics System -- ST00226WI-D, Rev F 
  â€¢FIAS Configuration AFIS Equipment SA9171SC-D thru Rev 02
  â€¢**Vapor Cycle System (VCS) â€“ SA9176SC-D thru Rev 02
  â€¢Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) â€“ SA9177SC-D, Original
  â€¢Parker /Gull Navigation Computer unit (NCU) SA2136SW-AC, Rev 01
  â€¢AFIS Enhancements Supp. No. S09645, Rev 01
  â€¢**UHF Secure Voice (KY058) Systems â€“ S09470, Original
  â€¢UNS-1Fw Flight Management Systems â€“ S09475, Rev 04
  â€¢**Radio Frequency Interface (RFI) Direction-Finding (DF) System, S09478, Original
  â€¢**Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) â€“ S09481, Rev 02
  â€¢**IFF Transponder â€“ S09091, Rev 01
  â€¢**Emergency Vision Assurance Systems (EVAS) ST01012WI, Rev 2
  â€¢**TAS EVS-1000 Enhanced Vision System (EVS) ST01440LA, Rev C
  â€¢**LAIRCAM System, AN/AAQ-24(V) Missile Defense System S09640, Rev 02
  â€¢Multi-Mode Receiver, GNLU-955M S09638, Rev 01
  â€¢Teledyne Controls Flight Data Acquisition Unit and an L-3 Comm Flight Data Recorder â€“ S09494, Original
  â€¢**HF-9000 Communications System (HF-9010 Control) â€“S80004, Original

As stated above, this Market Survey is requesting information from vendors who have business experience in upgrading and modifying general aviation jet aircraft to meet the FAAâ€™s 2020 ADS-B Out mandate.  

The information requested at this time is for planning purposes only and for the development of a source list.  The FAA needs sound cost and time estimations on the effort it will take to bring the FAAâ€™s Challenger 601 aircraft (22 years old or older) to sustain flying another 10 to 15 years; and, meets both FAA and ICAO avionics standards.  As a part of this Market Survey, we ask interested vendors to complete Attachment A to this survey.  The information needs to be provided as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).

The adjacent terrain is generally steep with tall slopes. This project is located in a sensitive natural setting. Mitigation of wetland areas, on-site and nearby, are included in the project. Provisions will be necessary to protect Federal or State listed endangered, threatened, or special concern species. Provisions will include limitations on when and where work can occur. Contractor-furnished biological monitors will be required for some elements of the work. An 11 acre government-owned material source has been identified along the lower and flatter portion of the road. The quality of material is generally acceptable, but may require removal of unacceptable material or blending to produce aggregate for surface course or asphalt.</span></span></span></span></p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition basis from National Technology, Inc.(NTA), 2800 Shirlington RD. STE 700, Arlington, VA - 22206-3611, a ten (10) month extension of contract N68936-11-D-0026 for 86,958.50 hours of production support services. This is necessary for the continuation of production support services to the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) Production and Tooling Support Services program in support of the F/A-18 series, C-130 series, E-2C, C-2A, UH-1 series, AH-1W, H-60 series, H-53 series, EA-6B, S-3B, AV-8 series, and other various aircraft programs at various fleet and shore activities. This acquisition is a bridge effort to the current contract for continued support until the competitive follow-on contract is awarded. This contract extension is required to allow sufficient time to award a competitive follow-on contract with an anticipated award date in September 2017. Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." NTA is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under this contract and the need to continue these services, NTA is the only source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of the competitive follow-on contract. The anticipated period of performance of this extension will be 01 December 2016 through 30 September 2017. THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 31 October 2016 at 4:00PM PST. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any submissions or questions shall be submitted via email to David Belasco at david.belasco@navy.mil

<ARCHDATE>06012017
<CONTACT>Laura Mattiford 2156979674
<DESC>The Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia Office, intends to procure, on a full and open basis, services on behalf of the Commander, Naval Installations Command (CNIC) for the provision of Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) services.   NCACS is designed to enhance security at US Navy facilities, enclaves and installations, by providing a means to electronically authenticate and vet non-federal government personnel requiring installation access for official business. For this effort, CNIC requires contractor support for Commercial Credentialing Source (CCS) providers for the credentialing, vetting and validation of access control credentials being used to access Navy installations worldwide.
  The Government-owned NCACS integrated enterprise system requires the vetting of all NCACS program applicants as well as the ability to produce PIV-I compliant credentials that are capable of being electronically scanned, read, and validated via an automated connection to one or more authoritative databases that have been established to aid in the electronic validation of these types of credentials. These DoD-grade PIV-I high assurance credentials will interoperable with the DoD PKI system via ECA cross-certification with the FBCA and can be leveraged by the DoD Relying Parties, such as CNIC to validate access requirements for contractors and vendors entering Navy installations.  External Certificate Authorities (ECA) approved for DoD-use ensure compliance with the DoD guidance and policy for access control.
  THE DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS SYNOPSIS REFLECTS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AS OF THIS PRINTING.  THESE FACTS MAY BE UPDATED OR REVISED IN THE ACTUAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, WHEN ISSUED.  In order to accomplish the tasks within the performance work statement (PWS), the CCS provider must:  obtain and maintain an approved Information Assurance (IA) Authority to Operate (ATO) certification; obtain and maintain approved Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA); support communications between CSS IT system and the Defense Installation Access Control/Identity Management Enterprise Services Architecture (DIAC/IMESA) transfer capability of identity data from in the Joint Gatekeeper Services (JGS) format via the federal bridge; possess the ability to query the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) to conduct background checks prior to recommending to the Government representative issuance of CCS credential.
  This requires the CCS provider to receive Federal Bureau of Investigations â€“ Criminal Justice Information System (FBI-CJIS) authorization to conduct background checks from their facility and provide proper safeguards to protect NCIC data once received; possess the ability to produce PIV-I compliant access control credentials that allow both physical and logical access; and meet all physical security-contractor facility requirements for the handling of classified data, processing PII and Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) and For Official Use Only (FOUO) on a routine basis.  This requires the CCS provider demonstrate the ability to protect and store data to prevent compromise.  Under this instant effort, CNIC will require the CCS provider to provide recommendation to the Government regarding the issuance of credentials, produce credentials that are FIPS-201-2 compliant to allow authentication/validation by Government-owned handheld scanners/card readers and issue approved identity credentials under its approved system to individuals, firms, associations, organizations, entities, contractors or vendors that desire US Navy acceptance of their FIPS 201-2 aligned Personal Identity Verification Interoperable (PIV-I) credentials for access to all facilities, enclaves and/or installations at CNIC Ashore Regions.
 These regions comprise approximately 280 separate entry control points (ECPs) and facilities that will require support under this contract.  After thorough market research, including a sources sought, the KO has determined that full and open competition is the most appropriate method. The small business office concurs with the set aside determination.  It is intended that this procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) and FAR Part 12 (Commercial Items) will apply.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) non-personal services contract is anticipated that will consist of a one year base period and four, one year option periods.  The anticipated period of performance is 01 October 2017 through 30 September 2018, with four(4) one-year option periods, continuing performance through 30 September 2022, if exercised.
 The options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9.  In addition, the solicitation will include FAR 52.217-8, which if exercised, can extend performance through 31 March 2023.  The solicitation, N00189-17-R-Z005, is anticipated to be released around 23 November 2016 and will be made available electronically upon its release to NECO, www.neco.navy.mil.  The applicable NAICS code is 541519.  Any questions in relation to this pre-solicitation notice must be submitted in writing to laura.mattiford@navy.mil.

The VA anticipates issuing an open and continuous solicitation for this requirement in November 2016.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide instructions to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective Offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.   
In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management, prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).  Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov . To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in SAM.

<SUBJECT>Unrestricted Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services within EPA Region 2 and the Northwestern Division
<SOLNBR>W912DQ-17-R-3001
<RESPDATE>112216
<CONTACT>Kori Hames, Contract Specialist, Phone 8163892037, Email Kori.A.Hames@usace.army.mil - Michael D. Dixon, Contracting Officer, Phone 8163893577, Email michael.d.dixon@usace.army.mil
<DESC>1. Contract Information: <br />The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA). These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6.
<p>The work will be located within Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2 and the NWD boundaries (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the majority of the work in EPA Region 2. In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to five (5) unrestricted firms sharing $120 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than five (5) contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is unrestricted and open to all businesses, regardless of size. The period of performance for each contract will include a base period of five (5) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded by August 2017, or earlier. Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality. These task orders may be awarded as either fixed-price or cost reimbursement type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years. Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $120 million over the life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Large businesses that are selected will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. The Kansas City District subcontracting goals, which will be considered in the negotiation of the contracts, are: a minimum of 40% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Businesses (SB) with 3% of that to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), 7% to Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), 1% to Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZones), 2.0% to Veteran-owned, and 3% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $15 million or less.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are typically completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, design, engineering during construction, post-construction long term operations or monitoring, and post-construction optimization or modifications to existing systems and remedies. The project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order. When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will state that the contractor's SF 330 will be used, and/or may request unique experience or qualifications to be submitted and evaluated in conjunction with the SF 330. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is most highly qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and the ordering period will be in effect for the five (5) year base period. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined relative to the employee's office location rather than the location of work.</p>
<p>Prior to contract award, vendors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) which can be accomplished at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. There is NO FEE for this registration. Your SAM registration must reflect the NAICS code for this particular solicitation (541330). By submission of a proposal, an offeror acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award; during performance; and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation. For assistance, you may access the SAM help desk at the Federal Services Desk at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with FAR Parts 22.1310(b), 52.222-35 and 52.222-37, all firms must file a VETS-4212 between 01 August and 30 September of each year following the calendar year in which they had contract(s) over $150K for the procurement of personal property or non-personal services (including construction). Information can be found at the Department of Labor website http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm or you may e-mail the customer support center at VETS4212-customersupport@dol.gov; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNs number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information:<br />Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for Superfund projects in EPA Region 2. Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting.</p>
<p>Selected firms will work on a variety of projects, including, but not limited to: investigation of, and design of remedies for contaminated soil, groundwater, soil gas and indoor air, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, landfills, underground storage tanks and fueling systems. Assignments may include: site investigations, drilling and subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, analytical data validation, hazard evaluations, develop conceptual site models, perform treatability studies, feasibility and other engineering studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, prepare EE/CA reports, prepare Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study reports, prepare Remedial Designs, perform surveying and mapping, verify existing conditions and utilities, perform structural engineering assessments of existing structures, perform pilot studies, preparation of plans and specifications and engineering drawings, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, performing community relations support work, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings, preparing Remedial Action Completion Reports), dredging design, archaeological studies and mitigation plans, wetlands determinations and mitigation plans, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), perform 5 Year Reviews, review work products prepared by others and perform oversight of work performed by others, optimization studies on existing treatment facilities or monitoring programs, perform biological assessments and prepare habitat restoration and mitigation plans, evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria:<br />Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture. Criteria A through E are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:<br />The Specialized Experience and Technical Competence of the firm in the broad range of HTRW/environmental work required for this contract will be considered. Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in areas 1 through 4, below. The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Conducting Remedial Design work that includes preparing engineering and construction design documents for in-situ and ex-situ remediation. The Prime/JV A-E firm should demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities, including complex and diverse projects, and differing contaminants in various media for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste projects that follow CERCLA regulations and procedures. Projects performed on behalf of EPA Region 2 will receive higher consideration than work performed for other clients or agencies. Project work completed within the past 7 years will receive higher consideration than work performed more than 7 years ago. Only information presented in Section F of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this sub-criterion.</p>
<p>2. Remedial Investigation work that includes sample collection, interpretation of results, preparing conceptual site models, groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling, performing human health and ecological risk assessments, and Remedial Investigation Reports in accordance with CERCLA guidance and requirements. The Prime/JV A-E firm should demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities, including complex and diverse projects, and differing contaminants in various media for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste projects that follow CERCLA regulations. Projects performed on behalf of EPA Region 2 will receive higher consideration than work performed for other clients or agencies. Project work completed within the past 7 years will receive higher consideration than work performed more than 7 years ago. Only information presented in Section F of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this sub-criterion.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrated quality management processes and procedures that result in high quality work products. The Prime/JV A-E firm should demonstrate a strong understanding of quality management principles, including a description of organizational structure, responsibilities, and application of quality management procedures. Only information presented in Section H of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this sub-criterion.</p>
<p>4. Demonstrated capability in managing cost-reimbursable contracts. The Prime/JV A-E firm should demonstrate experience completing work under cost-reimbursable contracts with the Federal or State government(s). The Prime/JV A-E firm should demonstrate knowledge of applicable regulations and cost accounting principles necessary to manage work performed under cost-reimbursable contracts with the Federal or State government(s). Only information presented in Sections F and H of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this sub-criterion.</p>
<p>(B) Professional Qualifications:<br />The professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract will be considered, including the education, professional registration, proposed job title, longevity with the firm, and relevant HTRW/environmental experience of key personnel. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the Capacity criterion below. Firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located in both EPA Region 2 and the USACE NWD. Professional qualifications on projects performed on behalf of EPA Region 2 Superfund will have greater importance.</p>
<p>Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. List the education, professional registration (if applicable), proposed role in this contract, longevity with the firm, and relevant HTRW/environmental experience for the key disciplines:</p>
<p>#&nbsp;/&nbsp;Code #&nbsp;/ Key Discipline:&nbsp;/&nbsp;Minimum # of Resumes to be included:<br />1.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 48&nbsp; /&nbsp; Project Management&nbsp; /&nbsp; 4<br />2.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 12 or 23&nbsp; /&nbsp; Civil/Environmental Engineering&nbsp; /&nbsp; 3<br />3.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 27&nbsp; /&nbsp; Geotechnical Engineering&nbsp; /&nbsp; 3<br />4.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 10&nbsp; /&nbsp; Chemical/Process Engineering&nbsp; /&nbsp; 3<br />5.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 30&nbsp; /&nbsp; Geology/Hydrogeology&nbsp; /&nbsp; 3<br />6.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 11&nbsp; /&nbsp; Chemistry&nbsp; /&nbsp; 3<br />7.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 50&nbsp; /&nbsp; Risk Assessment&nbsp; /&nbsp; 2<br />8.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 18&nbsp; /&nbsp; Cost Engineering&nbsp; /&nbsp; 2<br />9.&nbsp; /&nbsp; 36&nbsp; /&nbsp; Industrial Hygiene&nbsp; /&nbsp; 2<br />10. /&nbsp; none&nbsp; /&nbsp;Health Physics&nbsp; /&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>Note: Code # for various disciplines defined in SF 330 Instructions, page 5</p>
<p>Only information presented in Section E of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this criterion. There is no maximum number of resumes required per discipline, and all resumes will count towards the overall page count.</p>
<p>(C) Past performance:<br />Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be considered. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) will be the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for the Prime/JV firms submitting a SF330. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performance, the board will consider the relevancy of performance evaluations on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance.</p>
<p>(D) Capacity: <br />The maximum task order amount will be the contract capacity. The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above from the Prime/JV and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. Only information presented in Part II of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this criterion. Firms are reminded to use the discipline specific Function Codes as defined in the SF330 Instructions, page 5. Firms should annotate the Part II forms to include Health Physics as one of the key disciplines even though there is no Function Code specific to this discipline.</p>
<p>(E) Knowledge of the Locality: <br />Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located in both EPA Region 2 and the USACE NWD. The board will evaluate a Prime/JV's knowledge and experience dealing with regional geological and hydrogeological conditions, and the state/local regulatory agencies, in the EPA Region 2 and NWD localities. Information presented in Section H of the SF330 will be the primary basis for evaluation for this criterion, and pertinent information included in Sections E and F will be also be considered.</p>
<p>(F) Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The two secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. SB and SDB Participation. The extent of participation of Small Businesses (SB), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Minority Institutions (MI) will be evaluated. The greater the participation, the greater the consideration, provided that the goals are realistic, and in line with the District's goals as stated above. Only information presented in Section H of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this criterion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding Prime/JV firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated amounts for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. Only information presented in Section H of the SF330 will be the basis for evaluation for this criterion.</p>
<p>4. Submittal Requirements: <br />Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (03/2013 edition) for the Prime/JV firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C.</p>
<p>For the ten (10) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders if they are from the same site or installation. If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes.</p>
<p>The instructions for SF330 require certain project specific details for each of the 10 projects presented in Section F of the SF330. In addition to the information required by the SF330 instructions, all project descriptions must include the following additional information in Box # 24:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract number or numbers under which the firm performed the work. Include the Task Order number for work done under an Indefinite Delivery Type Contract.<br />&bull; The type of contract under which the work was performed (Firm Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursable, or other).<br />&bull; The total contract obligation amount including all modifications, award date, and period of performance for each contract or contracts that include the project work being described.<br />&bull; The percentage of the contract amount performed by the prime offeror, JV partner, or team subcontractor.<br />&bull; The starting and ending dates, or period during which the work being described was performed.<br />&bull; Indicate whether or not there is one or more corresponding performance assessment ratings located in the CPARS system for the subject project work being described.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 100 printed pages with Section H limited to twenty (20) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 100 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font.</p>

<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

<p><br />A. Background</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was created in 1989 "to enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of health care services and access to such services, through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions and in the organization, financing and delivery of health care services)." In 1999, Congress, in its reauthorization language, stated that the Director of the AHRQ "shall conduct and support research and build private-public partnerships to (1) identify the causes of preventable health care errors and patient injury in health care delivery; (2) develop, demonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving patient safety; and (3) disseminate such effective strategies throughout the health care industry."</p>
<p>The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component (HC), Medical Provider Component (MPC), and Insurance Component (IC), which began in 1996, is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals (MEPS-HC), their medical providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.) (MEPS-MPC), and employers across the United States (MEPS-IC). MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers. For further discussion of the MEPS family of surveys as well as historical context please see: http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The primary objective of the MPC is to collect data from medical providers (hospitals, physicians, home care agencies, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities) on expenditures for medical services provided to MEPS Household Component (HC) sample persons. Such data are essential to improve the accuracy of the national medical expenditure estimates derived from the MEPS HC, since household respondents are not always the most reliable source of information on medical expenditures. The data also serve as the primary imputation source of medical expenditure data to correct for the item nonresponse on this measure by the MEPS household sample participants. MPC data also serve as an imputation source for item nonresponse to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures. They also serve as source of expenditure information on physician charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital, as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients. <br /><br />C. Project Requirements</p>
<p>Providers for the MPC sample for one year includes all hospitals, emergency rooms, home care agencies, outpatient departments, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities reported by HC respondents, as well as all physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital (these physicians are identified by the hospitals not the HC respondents). HMOs are included in the MPC data collection. Office based medical providers where the provider is either a doctor of medicine (MD) or Osteopathy (DO) or practices under the direct supervision of an MD or DO are included in the MPC as well. Data collection consists of contacting and collecting data from approximately 5,500 hospitals, 13,000 office-based providers, 600 home care providers, and 100 institutions, 20,000 physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital, and 8,000 pharmacies. Data collection methods may include phone, fax, mail, self-administration, and electronic transmission (including CD-ROMS and secure transmission via FTP and email). Each year of the MPC, all providers shall be screened to ascertain their eligibility, their association with the MEPS household respondent, and to obtain information to facilitate the conduct of the core MPC interview. Currently, an Integrated Data Collection System (IDCS) that includes a Web component in which the MEPS-MPC forms are programmed for computer-assisted data entry (CADE) and a case management system (CMS) is used for data collection. Recruiting, training and managing a data collection staff that includes staff with phone data collection skills and staff with the ability to abstract data from financial and medical records is expected. The sample of the MEPS MPC is designed to provide data on events for which household respondents are less likely to be fully aware of the financial transactions regarding the medical care received, to enrich the sample of events available as donors for imputation, and to provide a basis for methodological analysis of household reported payments for all types of events. The contractor shall also develop specifications for matching data collected in the Medical Provider Component with complementary data collected in the Household Component. The Contractor shall organize the data collected in the MPC into data files usable with the SAS statistical software package with documentation. The contractor shall produce and deliver internal MPC files that include matched and unmatched data and produce matched files in the prescribed format and necessary matching variables and documentation. Appropriate security measures must be demonstrated with regards to maintaining the confidential protection of data collected.</p>

<DESC>Purpose: The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to assist the Army as it conducts market research of outdoor in-street/in-building coverage solutions. This RFI provides industry an opportunity to educate the Army on their LMR products/services, innovations and processes for expanding in-street/in-building coverage solutions to areas of substantial distance from a donor antenna site or RF Site. In response to this RFI please provide the following: <br /><br />1) Provide a list of potential solutions that will provide in-street/in-building coverage across a substantial geographic area (in excess of 1 km) that is a substantial distance from an RF coverage area without the installation of a trunked repeater system.
<p>2) Given the use of high power amplifiers and low loss fiber optic cabling, what is the greatest distance that a Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) can be placed from a donor antenna using current Radio Frequency (RF) and fiber optic solutions?</p>
<p>3) What would be the maximum coverage area attainable using BDAs in an outdoor environment? Please include expected receive powers for a high power BDA over varying antenna heights as well as expected in-building and in-street coverage, assuming a flat topography with normal residential clutter.</p>
<p>The intent is to maximize the distance between the donor antenna and the BDA antenna and to maximize the in-street/in-building coverage area of the BDA in an effort to provide First Responder coverage to small geographical areas. Include the benefit of directional antennas and antenna height to assist in signal level and RF isolation from the donor antenna area. Please provide specification and example coverage maps for all outdoor coverage solutions, including predicted receive powers.<br />This Market Research is not a solicitation as defined by FAR 2.101, and the Government is not requesting offers or proposals at this time. Any responses to this RFI received by the Government will not be accepted to form a binding contract. This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This market survey is for planning purposes and no award will be made as a result of this RFI. If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents. The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the RFI.<br /><br />Please provide an information paper not to exceed five (5) pages (not including BDA, antenna specification sheets and coverage map examples); which details an outdoor coverage solution using BDA and donor antennas. Submit your information papers by electronic mail (email) to the contracting officer at a.c.baker2.civ@mail.mil with a carbon copy (CC) to the contracting specialist at araka.e.schroeder.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. There is no solicitation available at this time. This Sources Sought Notice is published for market research purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ), or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought, or otherwise pay for the requested information. Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC) is seeking qualified businesses to demonstrate their ability to perform the work described below. All qualified vendors may respond, and 8(a), HUBZONE Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Small Business sources are especially encouraged to reply.
 

NAVFAC EXWC requires unique technical skills for Construction work that may be performed on specialized antennas, towers, and communication facilities. General requirements are summarized below and specifics are included in the attached Parts 2 and 4.

The Navy operates and maintains several radio communication stations and several other similar facilities for various unique missions, including communication with strategic submarines, training aircrews and testing shipboard systems. Each of these stations and facilities have unique requirements for repair, maintenance and upgrade, as components wear out, as improved designs for components become available, and as mission requirements change.
 Presenting unique construction difficulties and engineering service challenges, these stations often include large specialized antenna structures, utilize very tall towers, and require specialized power to operate.

The contractor may need to provide Construction Services, and all other related tasking necessary to demolish, dispose, fabricate, refurbish, repair, modify, upgrade, build, install, or overhaul specialized facilities and related support equipment at one or more Naval communications stations and other similar locations. Incident to these construction services, the contractor may also need to provide some engineering services, such as minor amounts of inspection, concept development, design, engineering analysis, preparation of drawings/plans, writing of specifications, estimation of construction costs, procuring new components, controlling quality, troubleshooting, adjusting, and testing.

The facilities and related equipment are located throughout the world.
 The contractor may have to travel and subcontract for local services, as necessary, to complete each desired tasking order. It may be necessary to perform the work on a predefined and/or accelerated schedule in order to meet strategic fleet support objectives and the broadcasting needs of each communications facility.

All contractor employees and subcontractors working on project sites are required to be US citizens in good standing with clean records. Many locations require all employees working on-site to pass a background investigation (e.g., check of National Law Enforcement data bases, interviews, etc.) before being granted site access.

The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to identify interested/qualified vendors, and to determine if opportunities exist for the socioeconomic and small business programs provided in FAR part 19.
The prime contractor and subcontractor personnel shall be experienced and knowledgeable with general antenna operations, rigging safety, and grounding principles.
 In addition, the both must also demonstrate specific understanding of the same for unique antennas operating in the Low Frequency / Very Low Frequency transmission range.

All work shall conform to the latest applicable codes and standards of the appropriate governing body (i.e., federal, state, or local authority having jurisdiction) and of the appropriate standards setting organization (e.g., AEE, ASCE, ASME, ANSI, API, AWWA, EIA/TIA, IEEE, FAA, NEMA, NFPA, ISO, OSHA, etc.) All assigned contractor and subcontractor personnel shall demonstrate familiarity with and ability to apply all industry accepted and applicable codes, specifications and standards, appropriate to their level of responsibility.

As necessary, all assigned personnel shall be fully qualified to work in hazardous locations, such as very high elevation, very low temperature, and very high wind conditions.
 These hazardous locations may include confined spaces, rough mountain locations and high towers, with close high voltage, pressurized equipment, subject to lightning strikes. All personnel shall demonstrate an understanding of the applicable safety rules associated with such conditions, locations and equipment. Subcontractors performing utility distribution pipeline work must be familiar with all applicable codes and specifications including ASME, API, state, and CFR instructions.

Only a brief statement of qualifications (not to exceed 10 pages) is requested at this time. At a minimum, provide the following information in your submittal: 1) name and address of company and contact information/point of contact.
 Please include mailing address, telephone numbers, website, and email addresses, if applicable. Provide your companyâ€™s DUNS/CAGE numbers as well. 2) Name of Facility Security Officer and contact information to verify security requirements are met. 3) A statement of qualifications to include experience relative to this procurement, or any other information that clearly demonstrates your capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements.

The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement.
 The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. All submittals received will be reviewed for informational purposes. NAVFAC EXWC reserves the right to independently verify all information submitted.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Element 1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Build the Naval Innovation Network<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Element 2:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Manage the Talent of the DON Workforce<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Element 3:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Transform How the DON Uses Information<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Element 4:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Accelerate New Capabilities to the Fleet<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> <br /></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Element 5:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Develop Gamechanging Warfighting Concepts<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Service Objectives for Velocity Lab:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The intent of any agreement/contract resulting from this RFI is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to NSWC IHEODTD Offerors to this RFI should clearly articulate how they would anticipate fostering an environment within NSWC IHEODTD, academia, industry, and other government organizations that facilitates access to world-renowned facilities and researchers; develops and maintains synergistic relationships with the entrepreneur community and nontraditional defense contractors; facilitates government partnerships for the transition of knowledge and technology; and expands academic programs. <br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />NSWC IHEODTD invites offerors to provide information on how they can support the Innovation Pillars listed below as well as describe their own innovative ideas and processes that would support these pillars and any relevant experience in this area. We are seeking methods for accomplishing these concepts, how our Innovation Pillar concepts could be improved upon and insight into how Academia/Industry operates their own innovation centers.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Pillar 1: Enabling Design/Ideation<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />This capability often serves as the first stop on our innovation ladder. Its primary function is to support brainstorming, initial concept development and small learning workshops/seminars. We estimate between six and eighteen Design/Ideation sessions to be organized annually on topics generated by NSWC IHEODTD. Offeror should provide training to NSWC IHEODTD participants on all aspects of how Design/Ideation Sessions are conducted, so the participants can promulgate these methods to the rest of the workforce. It is desired to use State of the Art information visualization tools, design thinking support material and design aids in order to translate both NSWC IHEODTD's challenges and notional EMS concepts into actionable problems/solution sets.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Offerors must be capable of conducting workshops and roundtables to explore novel models of collaboration that enable NSWCH IHEODTD to identify new opportunities addressing shared challenges. These efforts can include but are not limited to 'hack-a-thons', table-top war gaming/alternative future exercises, and technical competitions. Offers should outline their own Ideation best practices, previous work/examples and tools/support aids used.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Pillar 2: Prototyping</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NSWC IHEODTD requires the ability to quickly transition ideas to a physical or virtual prototype in order to demonstrate viability, proof-of-concept, and/or socialize concept with prospective sponsors/Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)/warfighters. The majority of the services (3D printing, subtractive machining, CAD modeling &amp; simulation, electronics assembly/test, software/apps, etc.) are expected to be of the consumer/amateur grade. These services must be easily and rapidly accessible. These capabilities are often found in similar Fab Lab, Makerspaces, and Additive Manufacturing Centers. Offerors should expect to form relationships with local Makerspaces and machine shops to support this task and address surge or overflow capability, niche/specialized technical expertise, or other NSWC IHEODTD identified services appropriate for inclusion in the facility. Offerors should outline their own prototyping best practices, tools used and critical personnel requirements.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Pillar 3: Learning<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">&nbsp;<br /></em></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The Learning Pillar supports key Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Workforce Development objectives for NSWC IHEODTD. The offeror should outline plans to develop or utilize commercial training modules to educate NSWC IHEODTD personnel on a range of topics with the scope of Ideation and Prototyping (Arduino, 3D printing, etc.). At a minimum, training should be available for all equipment the offeror has identified to support the Prototyping Pillar. The training should be conducted to enable the 'train the trainer' methodology. That is, the offeror will train a small cadre and NSWC IHEODTD employees, who in turn will train their colleagues. Offeror is welcome to suggest other technical and collaboration training that supports the ethos of an innovation lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Offerors to this RFI shall also address how they will support creating and leveraging a broad network of partnerships with State and local government agencies, as well as academia, Department of Defense activities, and other Federal Government agencies to rapidly establish an environment to investigate, collaborate, and produce courses of action to solve technology and equipment challenges identified by NSWC IHEODTD. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Offerors shall identify their technical and administrative staff that will be utilized to provide assistance with prototyping equipment, visualization tools, meeting facilitation, and training associated with Pillars 1-3. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NSWC IHEODTD reserves the right to select all, some, or partial white paper content, or none of the white papers received in response to this RFI. NSWC IHEODTD reserves the right to initiate clarification of white papers and other material submitted in response to this RFI with offerors when deemed necessary. All future awards are subject to the availability of funds. Offerors <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">will not</strong> be reimbursed for white paper development costs. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI. White papers and other material submitted with the white paper for review purposes under this RFI will not be returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government will assess the Offeror's capability to satisfy the requirements by reviewing the Offeror's unique, innovative, or revolutionary approach plan and the ability to meet NSWC IHEODTD stated needs for innovation, collaboration, fabrication, and workforce development.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Offerors submitting white papers in response to this RFI should note that any resultant agreement may include terms and conditions that preclude the offerors from pursuing any other business opportunities and/or financial interests with NSWC IHEODTD outside of said agreement throughout the duration of the agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">All interested offerors must submit their information electronically no later than December 15, 2016 to:</span></p>

VAMC 678 Tucson (1107237) 
3601 South 16th Avenue, 
Tucson, AZ, 85723 

Re: AquamantysÂ® System & TranscollationÂ® Technology and PlasmaBlade Technology 
fax 866.222.0900 

The Aquamantys System, consisting of the Aquamantys pump generator (the "Generator") and the Aquamantys bipolar sealers (the "Disposables"), features Medtronic Advanced Energy LLC's ("MAE") proprietary Transcollation technology. This technology integrates RF energy and saline in a controlled relationship that permits haemostatic sealing and coagulation of soft tissue planes and bone. Transcollation technology allows tissue planes to be treated with a "painting" motion in addition to traditional spot sealing. The one (1) to two (2) millimeter depth of effect assures hemostatic sealing without the resultant charring typically associated with electrosurgery. 

Aquamantys products and Transcollation technology is the subject of numerous U.S. patent applications and/or patents. The Generator is covered by the following U.S. patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,702,810; 7,811,282; 7,815,634; and additional pending patent applications. The Aquamantys pump generator is not compatible with any bipolar sealers other than MAE's Aquamantys Disposables. The Disposables are covered by one or more of the following U.S. patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,645,277; 7,651,494, and additional pending patent applications. MAE's Aquamantys Disposables are not compatible with any generator other than MAE's Aquamantys Generator.

<p>Sites will be evaluated in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (in addition to other applicable laws and regulations). As such, sites on which the proposed development would significantly impact the human and natural environment in ways that could not be reasonably mitigated (as determined by the Government), will be evaluated less favorably and, depending on the nature and potential severity of the impact(s) (as determined by the Government), may be eliminated from further consideration. Accordingly, preference will be given to sites with developable areas that avoid or minimize impacts to regulated or protected environmental resources, including but not limited to:<br />&bull;	Floodplains:<br />o	Sites that contain/impact floodplains may be eliminated from further consideration if the Government determines there are practicable alternatives.<br />&bull;	Environmental contamination:<br />o	The Government should receive all available existing documentation regarding past use of the property and environmental contamination.<br />&bull;	Wetlands and other water resources<br />&bull;	Threatened and/or endangered species<br />&bull;	Protected land-uses (i.e. parks, preservation areas, open space, agriculture, environmental easements, etc.)<br />&bull;	Cultural (archaeological and historic) resources<br />&bull;	Preference will be given to sites with compatible surrounding land uses.</p>
<p>Land Use: <br />&bull;	The site would preferably be an existing underground mine, but could include undisturbed rock formation.  <br />&bull;	If the proposed site has existing or previous surface or subsurface mining, it is preferred that no more than 20% of the existing mine contain standing water.<br />&bull;	The site should generally be clear of discontinuities such as faults, significant fracture patterns or any type of sink hole</p>
<p>Proximity to Hazards: <br />&bull;	Sites that are within close proximity to continuous or infrequent hazards may be evaluated less favorably and, depending on the nature and severity of the hazard may be eliminated from consideration. Hazards include but are not limited to: <br />o	Influx of flowing or liquid hydrocarbons<br />o	Detectable toxic or explosive gas in the target formation or within the existing facility<br />Acquisition and Development Cost: <br />&bull;	Sites which, in the Government's estimation, provide opportunities to lower overall development costs for an Underground Safety Research Facility are preferred. <br />&bull;	All site conditions which may impact project schedule will be considered, including but not limited to: schedule for acquisition, design, and/or construction. External factors that may impact schedule will also be considered, including infrastructure and utility improvements, relocation costs, zoning impact, and local planning objectives.<br />In addition to these factors ("additional criteria"), the Government may consider other attributes of a site. No one criterion listed above is considered to be more important than any other, as a general matter. However, in the context of its evaluation of an individual site, with each site having unique attributes, the Government may treat some criteria as being more important than others. <br />SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:</p>

<p>1. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<p>2. SUBJECT: The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is conducting market research on behalf of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) to determine whether the availability of sources that can provide non-personal scientific support services for the production of Modified Dendrimer Nanoparticles (MDNP) vaccines for VEE (Venezaulan equine encephalitis) and other Alphaviruses. The fielded capability must meet or exceed the specifications listed below. The government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the Contract Service Provider (CSP) performing the services herein. Such CSPs shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn, in responsible to the Government.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Since 1969, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) has served as the Department of Defense's (DoD) lead laboratory for medical biological defense research. While its core mission is to protect the warfighter from biological threats, USAMRIID also investigates disease outbreaks and threats to public health. Research conducted leads to medical solutions-therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and information-that benefit both military personnel and civilians. USAMRIID is a subordinate laboratory of the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick, located in Frederick, MD.</p>
<p>Multiple vaccine candidates have been developed at USAMRIID; however, these candidate platforms still have limited capabilities to rapidly respond to emerging or evolving pathogens and sudden outbreaks. Therefore, strategies to improve Alphavirus vaccine technologies and platforms to allow for antigen flexibility and rapid production are of great interest. One vaccine technology currently being explored is an adjuvant-free dendrimer nanoparticle vaccine platform which encodes the antigen(s) using encapsulated mRNA replicons. Thus, the purpose of this service requirement is to seek services for the generation of Modified Dendrimer Nanoparticles (MDNP) for Alphaviruses.</p>
<p>4. RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Respondents should address the following in their capabilities statement:</p>
<p>A product development plan demonstrating realistic and attainable timelines for production of an adjuvant-free dendrimer nanoparticule vaccine that encodes Alphavirus antigen(s) using encapsulated mRNA replicons.</p>
<p>5. CONTACT INFORMATION: Any and all questions related to this RFI shall be directed to Samantha L. Connors at samantha.l.connors.civ@mail.mil. All information regarding Capabilities Statements or any other proprietary information relative to this RFI shall be submitted via email to samantha.l.connors.civ@mail.mil no later than 3:00 PM Eastern on October 28, 2016.</p>

<DESC>Dear Prospective Contractor:
This Notice is the first stage of the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Design-Build construction contract for the expansion of the Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. 
Project Description:
This project will comprise the fifth phase of major development and will include approximately 23,000 casketed gravesites, 13,000 columbarium niches and approximately 7,000 in-ground burial sites for cremated remains providing an additional 10-year burial capacity on undeveloped land.  The remainder of the site will be developed in future 10-year phased projects for full option burials.  Only those facilities and infrastructure elements necessary to support the increase in maintenance, operations, and interments for approximately 10 years will be included in this phase of construction.  Approximately 55 acres of undeveloped land will be utilized to develop a 10-year inventory of approximately 43,000 full burial option gravesites, a satellite maintenance facility, and an additional irrigation lake with this investment.  Also included in this project will be infrastructure repairs and upgrades to the existing Riverside National Cemetery as identified in the current Facility Condition Assessment.
Memorial Walls will be added at Riverside National Cemetery to accommodate memorial plaques honoring the memory of veterans, and other eligible individuals whose remains are not available for burial.  This project will also improve the cemetery entrance, including cortege staging lanes, visitor parking, access to public information, and public restrooms.  Drainage problems will also be addressed.  The project will also encompass needed irrigation improvements and corrections to the water channel and lake system as well as extension of irrigation into newly developed areas.  The project will also correct deficiencies in the infrastructure.  Renovations and additions to the Administrative Building and Maintenance Complex and Committal Service Shelters will be accomplished to accommodate military honors teams including volunteers and public information functions.  Improvements made to structures will incorporate Green Building Principals and Renewable Energy Initiatives in accordance with VA policy and latest energy efficient technology. 
The project shall include an Early Turnover (ETO) phase consisting of approximately 1,400 to 1,750 in-ground cremain sites and approximately 2,000 pre-placed crypts with associated site development requirements which must be completed and accepted for use within 810 calendar days from Notice to Proceed (NTP).  The Riverside National Cemetery expansion is planned as a Design Build acquisition for award in FY16.  The Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) will provide a requirements document consisting of program requirements, environmental and regulatory constraints, topographic and boundary survey, baseline geo-technical survey, performance schedule, and listing of applicable VA/NCA design guides, submission requirements, and planning criteria. The Design Build contract shall include a full complement of design services including the preparation of Master Plan, Schematic Design, Design Development and Construction documents in addition to all construction, commissioning, and LEED Silver certification.
The approximate project duration will be 1,440 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed. The estimated magnitude for this project is between $20,000,000 and $50,000,000. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with the size standard of $36.5 Million. 
CFM intends to conduct this acquisition in accordance with Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures.

Contractors will not perform inherently governmental functions and must conform to FAR Clause 52.203-16. 
52.203-16 - Preventing Personal Conflicts of Interest.
Preventing Personal Conflicts of Interest (Dec 2011)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
"Acquisition function closely associated with inherently governmental functions" means supporting or providing advice or recommendations with regard to the following activities of a Federal agency:
(1) Planning acquisitions.
(2) Determining what supplies or services are to be acquired by the Government, including developing statements of work.
(3) Developing or approving any contractual documents, to include documents defining requirements, incentive plans, and evaluation criteria.
(4) Evaluating contract proposals.
(5) Awarding Government contracts.
(6) Administering contracts (including ordering changes or giving technical direction in contract performance or contract quantities, evaluating contractor performance, and accepting or rejecting contractor products or services).
(7) Terminating contracts.
(8) Determining whether contract costs are reasonable, allocable, and allowable.
"Covered employee" means an individual who performs an acquisition function closely associated with inherently governmental functions and is-
(1) An employee of the contractor; or
(2) A subcontractor that is a self-employed individual treated as a covered employee of the contractor because there is no employer to whom such an individual could submit the required disclosures.
"Non-public information" means any Government or third-party information that-
(1) Is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or otherwise protected from disclosure by statute, Executive order, or regulation; or
(2) Has not been disseminated to the general public and the Government has not yet determined whether the information can or will be made available to the public.
"Personal conflict of interest" means a situation in which a covered employee has a financial interest, personal activity, or relationship that could impair the employee's ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the Government when performing under the contract. (A de minimis interest that would not "impair the employee's ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the Government" is not covered under this definition.)
(1) Among the sources of personal conflicts of interest are-
(i) Financial interests of the covered employee, of close family members, or of other members of the covered employee's household;
(ii) Other employment or financial relationships (including seeking or negotiating for prospective employment or business); and 
(iii) Gifts, including travel.
(2) For example, financial interests referred to in paragraph (1) of this definition may arise from-
(i) Compensation, including wages, salaries, commissions, professional fees, or fees for business referrals;
(ii) Consulting relationships (including commercial and professional consulting and service arrangements, scientific and technical advisory board memberships, or serving as an expert witness in litigation);
(iii) Services provided in exchange for honorariums or travel expense reimbursements;
(iv) Research funding or other forms of research support;
(v) Investment in the form of stock or bond ownership or partnership interest (excluding diversified mutual fund investments);
(vi) Real estate investments;
(vii) Patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property interests; or
(viii) Business ownership and investment interests.
(b) Requirements. The Contractor shall-
(1) Have procedures in place to screen covered employees for potential personal conflicts of interest, by-
(i) Obtaining and maintaining from each covered employee, when the employee is initially assigned to the task under the contract, a disclosure of interests that might be affected by the task to which the employee has been assigned, as follows:
(A) Financial interests of the covered employee, of close family members, or of other members of the covered employee's household
(B) Other employment or financial relationships of the covered employee (including seeking or negotiating for prospective employment or business).
(C) Gifts, including travel; and
(ii) Requiring each covered employee to update the disclosure statement whenever the employee's personal or financial circumstances change in such a way that a new personal conflict of interest might occur because of the task the covered employee is performing.
(2) For each covered employee--
(i) Prevent personal conflicts of interest, including not assigning or allowing a covered employee to perform any task under the contract for which the Contractor has identified a personal conflict of interest for the employee that the Contractor or employee cannot satisfactorily prevent or mitigate in consultation with the contracting agency;
(ii) Prohibit use of non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract for personal gain; and 
(iii) Obtain a signed non-disclosure agreement to prohibit disclosure of non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract.
(3) Inform covered employees of their obligation-
(i) To disclose and prevent personal conflicts of interest;
(ii) Not to use non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract for personal gain; and 
(iii) To avoid even the appearance of personal conflicts of interest;
(4) Maintain effective oversight to verify compliance with personal conflict-of-interest safeguards;
(5) Take appropriate disciplinary action in the case of covered employees who fail to comply with policies established pursuant to this clause; and
(6) Report to the Contracting Officer any personal conflict-of-interest violation by a covered employee as soon as it is identified. This report shall include a description of the violation and the proposed actions to be taken by the Contractor in response to the violation. Provide follow-up reports of corrective actions taken, as necessary. Personal conflict-of-interest violations include-
(i) Failure by a covered employee to disclose a personal conflict of interest;
(ii) Use by a covered employee of non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract for personal gain; and
(iii) Failure of a covered employee to comply with the terms of a non-disclosure agreement.
(c) Mitigation or waiver. 
(1) In exceptional circumstances, if the Contractor cannot satisfactorily prevent a personal conflict of interest as required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause, the Contractor may submit a request through the Contracting Officer to the Head of the Contracting Activity for-
(i) Agreement to a plan to mitigate the personal conflict of interest; or
(ii) A waiver of the requirement.
(2) The Contractor shall include in the request any proposed mitigation of the personal conflict of interest.
(3) The Contractor shall-
(i) Comply, and require compliance by the covered employee, with any conditions imposed by the Government as necessary to mitigate the personal conflict of interest; or
(ii) Remove the Contractor employee or subcontractor employee from performance of the contract or terminate the applicable subcontract.
(d) Subcontract flowdown. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in subcontracts-
(1) That exceed $150,000; and
(2) In which subcontractor employees will perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions (i.e., instead of performance only by a self-employed individual).

<SUBJECT>--LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:MICHAEL.THOMEY@HQ.DOE.GOV">CONTRACTING OFFICER</a>
<DESC>This is a limited sources justification for an award made to Northrop Grumman.
1. CONTRACTING AGENCY AND ACTIVITY.
The Department of Energy (DOE) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition with Northrop Grumman for continued maintenance and access to the DOE ePerformance system.  The DOE Office of Headquarters Procurement Services (MA-64), 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20858, will execute this action.  This document sets forth the justification and approval of the use of one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), ?Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized?.  This contract action will be conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program.  
2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED. This document sets forth the justification and approval for award of a Federal Supply Schedule order on a limited sources basis as required by FAR 8.405-6.  The Department of Energy, Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of Corporate Information Systems has a requirement for continued ePerformance support from Northrop Grumman.  Northrop Grumman will provide Operation & Maintenance (O&M) support for the DOE Electronic Employee Performance Appraisal application, using ePower from a GSA Task Order issued off of GSA Schedule GS-35F-4506G.
This requirement was satisfied by Northrop Grumman from 2011 through 2016 through Interagency Agreement DE-CF0000113 with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Under Interagency Agreement DE-CF0000113, the DOE has been utilizing a GSA Task Order issued by OPM for O & M support for ePerformance.  The OPM will not allow the DOE to continue utilizing OPM?s Task Order after September 30, 2016.  The DOE Contract Line Item (CLIN) option on OPM?s Task Order expires on September 30, 2016 and the OPM will not be renewing this CLIN.  Procurement was notified that OPM will not be renewing this option CLIN under OPM?s Task Order in May 2016.  A new 12 month vehicle is required by September 30, 2016 for continued O & M support.  The current OPM task order that the DOE has been utilizing under DE-CF0000113 was issued under FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) ?Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized?.  
The DOE ePerformance Appraisal Application has demonstrated cost savings and efficiencies through the automation of employee performance data collection and the transfer of completed performance forms to the Electronic Official Personnel Folder (EOPF) application hosted by the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM).  A firm fixed price (FFP) Task Order is contemplated, to include the labor services and other direct costs (ODC?s) necessary to complete the required services.
3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES This requirement provides project management services that are specifically related to HR modernization initiatives. The Contractor shall provide personnel services needed to support key objectives as stated in the Statement of Work, specifically; 
Operations & Maintenance (O&M) support The Contractor shall have a thorough understanding of the DOE Electronic Employee Performance Appraisal application. The Contractor shall also have experience working with ePOWER, the document management/workflow (DM/WF) product selected by the Office of Personnel Management for their eOPF solution. The contractor must be able to transmit electronic performance material (forms and data) from the ePOWER into the eOPF. The period of performance is 12 months effective upon contract award. 
The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) was derived using historical data from the invoices submitted by the OPM for services currently obtained through Interagency Agreement DE-CF0000113.  The total anticipated dollar value for this acquisition is $327,700.00.  It is based on a FFP Task Order type with the allocation for 4 labor categories and a set Other Direct Cost (ODC) for travel and software licenses, per year.  
4. AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE The authority for this action is FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B), ?Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized?. The original task order was not competed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in accordance with 8.405.  The OPM will not be re-issuing the current task order that is providing O & M support to ePerformance.  A one year task order is required to allow the DOE to perform additional market research and possibly compete the requirement for providing ePerformance to the DOE.   
5. ORDERING ACTIVITY CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH 8.404(d). Northrop Grumman?s price quote will be evaluated in accordance with the rates published in GSA schedule GS-35F-4506G.  The rates for the labor categories required for this requirement are already considered fair and reasonable under 8.404 (d).  The DOE will request additional discounts from the rates that are listed in Northrop Grumman?s GSA schedule.
6. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED. Internet and General Services Administration?s (GSA) e-library market surveys were conducted and it revealed that no other eligible concerns were capable of satisfying the needs because Northrop Grumman is providing proprietary products and services; the contractor is the only company that can provide an ePerformance application specific to DOE requirements and the eOPF as they relate to this Task Order.   
7.  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION. This effort represents a natural continuation of the DOE ePerformance application that has been developed by Northrop Grumman.  Northrop Grumman is uniquely qualified to meet DOE?s needs for the automation of performance management. The impact of not awarding this sole source Task Order includes: a)  Interruption in support of the current DOE ePerformance application b)  Possible Resumption of manual Performance Management process. c) Manual data collection and reporting of key performance management milestones, d) Archaic method of managing and archiving performance documents.
8.  ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION. There are no barriers to competition that the DOE may remove.

On a limited number of projects, NAWC-AD has demonstrated the ability to deliver aircraft modification and integrations with equal or better quality and value as OEM/prime contractors to Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as well as Programs of Record (PORs). AIRWorks was created with this acknowledgement and the charge to deliver projects for PORs with equal efficiency and value as NAWC-AD has been delivering to the COCOMs for many years.</p>
<p>AIRWorks is an organization, operating within NAWC-AD, which has a primary role of managing and executing projects as a Government LSI. Projects range from rapid response projects to large deliberate projects. These projects are directed to NAWC-AD from U.S. Navy and Marine Corps PORs managed by Program Executive Officers and Program Offices, generally equating to the highest priority, and may range from traditional acquisition timelines to urgent operational response programs with National priority and immediate operational deployment requirements.</p>
<p>AIRWorks is organized with all NAVAIR competencies, from program management, including Contracts, Comptroller and Counsel, to logistics, and engineering and test, integrated into a team to maximize efficiency in project execution.</p>
<p>NAWC-AD AIRWorks is seeking Vendors with extensive experience in the following LSI functions:</p>
<p>&bull; Program management of complex system of systems design and integration<br />&bull; Systems engineering to support system design from conceptual layouts through complete technical data packages supporting production<br />&bull; Reverse engineering of commercial or military-grade parts/components/assemblies<br />&bull; Aircraft modification/component design<br />&bull; Aircraft component fabrication<br />&bull; Aircraft modification prototyping and installation<br />&bull; Initial modification provisioning and kitting<br />&bull; Test support capability to support verifications/validations, development and operational testing, acceptance and certification testing<br />&bull; Field installation capability<br />&bull; Post modification delivery support and publications/logistics capabilities<br /><br />Most work for this BOA will be supporting highly complex system of systems integration or mission system development programs requiring broad, specialized capabilities, facilities and testing requirements. This includes systems of system highly complex systems engineering, very large diverse team requirements, high capacity or specialized facilities, developmental ground and flight test capabilities, and potentially multiple year schedules. The preponderance of the work to support AIRWorks is expected to be accomplished at the vendor's facilities.</p>
<p>In providing LSI capabilities, the vendor will be expected to provide/deliver personnel, material, facilities, equipment, software, and other supplies and services necessary to support NAWC-AD AIRWorks in the design, development, documentation, delivery, fabrication, installation, test, evaluation and fielding of major aircraft modifications and mission systems.</p>
<p>AIRWorks operates in accordance with AS9100C and the Naval Aviation Maintenance Program (NAMP).</p>
<p>As a member of the NAVAIR AIRWorks organization, these projects may originate in any NAWC-AD competency, Program Office, or outside agency. The priority of projects may range from traditional acquisition timelines to urgent operational response programs with National priority and immediate operational deployment requirements.</p>
<p>This effort is being posted to include PSC code K016 and NAICS code 336411 under Solicitation number N68335-17-R-0022.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for this BOA, your company must provide a capabilities statement and meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Must hold a current AS9100 Certification with no exclusions and with the appropriate revision,<br />&bull; Must hold a current FAA part 145 Repair Facility Certificate with a minimum of a Limited Rating for Airframe and a Limited Rating for Powerplant,<br />&bull; Must be able to accommodate project and facility SECRET classification level requirements,<br />&bull; Must be able to perform all work within the Continental United States (CONUS) to include operations and facilities, <br />&bull; Must have a modification hangar of sufficient size to accommodate a C-130 size aircraft (140 ft. wide by 120 ft. long by 45 ft. tall) or larger co-located to a runway of 5,000 ft. length or greater, <br />&bull; Must be able to reverse engineer aircraft components or assemblies.</p>
<p>For vendors who currently meet the above requirements and are interested in obtaining a BOA, submit a request via email to: hank.bell@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Please include:</p>
<p>&bull; Company Name<br />&bull; Cage Code<br />&bull; Company Address<br />&bull; Company Telephone<br />&bull; Company Email<br />&bull; Company Point of Contact<br />&bull; Company Capabilities Statement relative to the criteria listed above<br />&bull; AS9100 Certificate</p>
<p>&nbsp;Future orders will be competed among existing BOA holders at the time of the Request for Proposal (RFP). A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term; (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided; (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The BOA template to be utilized is attached to this notice. See Attachment 1. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually, to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.</p>
<p>Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price/cost proposals leading to the award of orders. Future orders may be competed based on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) or Best Value basis. Specific firm-fixed price and cost reimbursement orders will be competed among the BOA holders. In order to receive a cost-type order, a contractor must have a Government approved accounting system prior to issuance of RFP.</p>
<p>Issuance of BOA's will be based on the government's evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice. The Government reserves the right to set-aside future BOA orders for small businesses contractors when practicable.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA to a contractor who fails to meet the above stated criteria. BOAs will be issued for a period of five years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, NAVAIR may continue to place orders under the BOA. Contractors must have representations and certifications registered on the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>All questions and submissions in reference to this notice will be sent to the Point of Contact for this requirement, Hank Bell, Phone: (732) 323-1613, E-mail: hank.bell@navy.mil.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is requesting information and invites feedback on its goal to establish an innovation lab (referred to hereafter as Velocity Lab).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The overarching objective is to educate, foster and develop ideas/prototypes for the Department of the Navy's Energetic Material Systems (EMS), support the Energetics Renaissance and NSWC IHEODTD core missions, while maximizing technology transfer of dual-use technologies and supporting educational partnerships. The intent of this solicitation is to evaluate resources (knowledge, training...) that could support a Velocity Lab and training the participants. Proximity of interested offerors to NSWC IHEODTD main site in Indian Head, Maryland, is critical to reduce travel time/resources and encourage active participation from the workforce. NSWC IHEODTD desires this capability to be available both on base and off-base, located within the Town of Indian Head or within a 10 mile radius of this location.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NSWC IHEODTD is interested in services that would support training, engineering and meeting facilitation centered around our three Innovation Pillars; Enabling Design/Ideation, Prototyping, and Learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NSWC IHEODTD is seeking relevant experience fostering innovation (best practices, supporting brainstorming/red teams, design thinking, etc.) in Government, Industry or Academia and related technology transfer activities. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Background</span></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">:</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SECNAV in 2015 released two Memoranda, "Task Force Innovation" and "Naval Innovation Advisory Council," that sought to coalesce and improve an 'innovative culture and [its] processes.' Along with the Action Memos, the Department of Navy Strategy and Innovation Office published the "Department of Navy Innovation Vision" which established 5 Innovation Elements. They are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Element 1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Build the Naval Innovation Network</span></p>

The majority of the services (3D printing, subtractive machining, CAD modeling &amp; simulation, electronics assembly/test, software/apps, etc.) are expected to be of the consumer/amateur grade. These services must be easily and rapidly accessible. These capabilities are often found in similar Fab Lab, Makerspaces, and Additive Manufacturing Centers. Offerors should expect to form relationships with local Makerspaces and machine shops to support this task and address surge or overflow capability, niche/specialized technical expertise, or other NSWC IHEODTD identified services appropriate for inclusion in the facility. Offerors should outline their own prototyping best practices, tools used and critical personnel requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Pillar 3: Learning<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Learning Pillar supports key Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Workforce Development objectives for NSWC IHEODTD. The offeror should outline plans to develop or utilize commercial training modules to educate NSWC IHEODTD personnel on a range of topics with the scope of Ideation and Prototyping (Arduino, 3D printing, etc.). At a minimum, training should be available for all equipment the offeror has identified to support the Prototyping Pillar. The training should be conducted to enable the 'train the trainer' methodology. That is, the offeror will train a small cadre and NSWC IHEODTD employees, who in turn will train their colleagues. Offeror is welcome to suggest other technical and collaboration training that supports the ethos of an innovation lab.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Offerors to this RFI shall also address how they will support creating and leveraging a broad network of partnerships with State and local government agencies, as well as academia, Department of Defense activities, and other Federal Government agencies to rapidly establish an environment to investigate, collaborate, and produce courses of action to solve technology and equipment challenges identified by NSWC IHEODTD. </span></p>

The third-party evaluator will request information from small business voucher recipients annually for five (5) years after voucher commencement. Voucher recipients are expected to complete a web survey necessitating no more than 30 minutes of the respondent&rsquo;s time each year. The survey questions will seek information from respondents such as: satisfaction with pilot participation processes and pilot services received; interest in subsequent lab assistance; technology development status; commercialization advancements; intellectual property created; follow-on funding attained; and product sales, if any. Time and cost incurred to comply with these reporting requirements can be included in a requester&rsquo;s cost share contribution. </span></p>

First, an external (non-lab) merit review committee will review each RFA and the result of that review will inform which RFAs will continue to the next step in the review process. Second, labs will work with DOE to determine the optimal lab-company match to enter into the semi-finalist review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Semi-finalists will be matched with a lab researcher. The lab and the semi-finalists will have approximately 4 weeks to work to develop a brief statement of work and budget, which will be presented to DOE for consideration. Third, the labs will present the proposed projects to DOE for final review and selection. The DOE Technology Offices will select SBV projects relevant to their technological focus. After selections, the labs will enter into final negotiations with the requesters for the selected projects. </span></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Luer Activated Needleless Connectors. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) IAN-1609-07_Luer_Activated_Needleless_Connectors are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Luer Activated Needleless Connectors products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the subject QSL. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is November 2016. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. </strong>The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Luer Activated Needleless Connectors.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Luer Activated Needleless Connectors. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $661,258 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the subject QSL who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below. </strong>In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA.</span> Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet.

Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.<br /><br /><strong>Item Descriptions /<br /></strong>ANTIMICROBIAL LUER ACTIVATED NEEDLELESS CONNECTOR (ZERO OR NEUTRAL DISPLACEMENT) /<br /><br />3.	Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The NIST Sensor Science Division is working on a project to make more accurate radiometric measurements of the light from the moon and certain standard stars than have ever been made before. These NIST measurements will then serve as standard calibration spectra for multiple stakeholders who in turn operate other satellite and astronomical instruments that periodically view the moon and the standard stars.<br />For the success of the lunar and stellar irradiance project, NIST identified a need for spectrographs meeting stringent specifications while attempting to perform high-accuracy spectral irradiance measurements of standard stars, the moon, and the sun.  The success of the lunar and stellar irradiance project will require a spectrograph with irradiance sensitivity and wavelength range.  The lunar and stellar irradiance project needs to be able to measure at more limited wavelength range with better sensitivity. The spectrographs must also be able to be operated remotely using computer control, rather than interactive with an operator always at the controls. This requires that any software that controls the spectrographs be able to be controlled by other software that we have already developed for controlling generic spectrographs (LabVIEW) using the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. We also require remote operation via computer and for the vendors to supply software drivers for their system so that their specific spectrograph software can be controlled by our more general software (LabVIEW). <br />This acquisition is for two (2) Optical Array Spectrographs.</p>

<SUBJECT>Indonesia - PT KAI Rail Maintenance Systems Technical Assistance
<SOLNBR>2016-31017A
<RESPDATE>120916
<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, USTDA - 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600 Arlington, VA 22209, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email RFPQuestions@ustda.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Rangga Putra Maulana (Manager of Track Maintenance) <br />PT. Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero) (PT KAI)<br />Jl. Perintis Kemerdekaan No. 1 Bandung - Indonesia<br />Phone :+6222 - 4230031 Ext 13120<br />Fax : +6222 - 4203342<br />Email  : 48626@Kereta-Api.co.id
<p><br />Solicitation Number: 2016-31017A<br />Indonesia: PT KAI Rail Maintenance Systems TA<br /><br />The Grantee (PT Kereta Api Indonesia, "Persero," "PT KAI") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to assist the Grantee on the Rail Maintenance Systems project.</p>
<p>To accommodate continued growth in rail passenger and freight traffic, PT KAI intends to expand its railroad network and make significant investments, such as building new track, acquiring rolling stock, and installing signaling systems.  The Indonesian government recognizes the importance of rail transport to economic development but the network requires continued modernization to function at a level needed to promote sustained growth. PT KAI does not have a comprehensive rail maintenance program, and has requested USTDA assistance for improving their overall track condition and safety in a cost-effective and operationally efficient manner. The TA would help PT KAI determine the justification for investment in a comprehensive rail maintenance program.  The TA would include a review of the railway's track maintenance practices and standards, and would provide recommendations that could lead to improvement in track condition, increases in maximum train speed, and improved safety.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $515,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form.</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 17:00 (LOCAL TIME / GMT+7), FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 2016 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<DESC>1.  The purpose of Amendment 0007 is to inform offerors' and interested parties that Solicitation VA119-16-Q-0033 was cancelled in error. 
2.  Amendment 0006 was intended only to cancel Amendments 0004, and 0005 of Solicitation VA119-16-Q-0033. 
"	Amendment 0004 was a combined synopsis solicitation issued 9/23/2016, with a closing date of 10/10/2016. That amendment was to fulfill the 'Rule of Two' based on the KingdomWare Court Ruling. Amendment 0004 was intended for Service Disable Veterans Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran Own Small Businesses (VOSB). 
"	Amendment 0005 extended the solicitation closing from 10/10/2016 thru 10/14/2016 due to October 10th, 2016 falling on Columbus Day making the closing date a national holiday. 
Amendment 0006 was intended  only to cancel amendments 0004 and 0005. However, as presented, this Amendment actually closed all of solicitation VA119-16-Q-0033, which was not the intent.
3.  Amendment 0007 hereby cancels Amendments 0004 thru 0006 in their entirety.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 8 to BAA RIK-14-12
<p>The purpose of this Amendment to BAA RIK-14-12 is to make the following changes to:</p>
<p>1) SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description": Add a focus area for FY 17 entitled Cyber Defense Interface <br />2) SECTION IV, "Application and Submission Information", Sub-paragraph 1, "Submission Dates and Times: Add submission date for the new FY17 Focus Award</p>
<p><strong>CHANGE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>a) SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description". The following Focus Area is added:</p>
<p>SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA FOR 2017</p>
<p>Cyber Defense Interface: In a given scenario, multiple characterized defense techniques are available to protect a network, which is running a number of concurrent missions. This focus area is soliciting research concerning the implementation of an interface to understand current and potential defense configurations that balance the resource requirements and security requirements of ongoing missions. While the goal of the cyber defense configuration is to maximize cyber security while minimizing system and network resource impact, the interface needs to display where particular cyber defenses could exist on the network as well as display network traffic flows. The interface should have the ability to show whether certain network traffic is desired, i.e. matches the mission required network flows, or not expected, i.e. potentially hostile. It should also identify if mission-required network traffic is not currently identified on the network, which would indicate potentially misconfigured network defense(s).</p>
<p>This research shall produce a capability that interprets data from a network of systems running within an already-developed framework that allows communication between systems. This framework has the capability to deploy a set of cyber defenses on each of the systems. Additionally, the product shall become the user interface for a cyber defense decision engine that provides multiple "best choice" solutions for a given network and mission. The interface shall provide a method of comparison between optional defense configurations as well as selection and implementation. Finally, the interface should allow modification of user preferences based on current security or mission priority.</p>
<p><strong>White papers for this topic are due by 1 DEC 16. Awards will range 12-18 months with dollar amounts up to $850,000. Multiple contracts may be awarded.</strong></p>
<p>b) SECTION IV, "Application and Submission Information", Sub-Paragraph 1/ SUBMISSION DATES AND TIME, is revised as follows:</p>
<p>1. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:</p>
<p>FY14 - 29 Aug 2014<br />FY15 - 31 Jul 2015<br />FY16 - 29 Jul 2016<br /><strong>FY17 - 1 Dec 2016*/</strong>31 Jul 2017 <br />FY18 - 31 Jul 2018</p>
<p><strong>*SPECIFIC TO FY17 FOCUS AREA/ Cyber Defense Interface ONLY: White papers must be received by 1 Dec 2016 for this area. </strong></p>
<p>White papers will be accepted until 2 PM Eastern Time on 28 Sep 2018, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. This BAA will close on 28 Sep 2018.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No other changes have been made.</strong></p>

<RESPDATE>110316
<CONTACT>Matthew Buchanan, Phone 5082336141, Email matthew.r.buchanan6.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>** This modification is to update the location of the JCB Industry Day. **<br /><br />OVERVIEW
<p>The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PdM-SCIE) is conducting market research through this Request for Information (RFI) to determine Industry's capability to manufacture Jungle Combat Boots (JCB) for a Directed Requirement (DR), which is separate from PdM-SCIE's Program of Record JCB requirement. The goal of this DR effort is to meet an urgent fielding need for two (2) Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), beginning with one BCT in March 2017 and the second BCT completed by September 2017. This RFI is intended to identify the capability of Industry to provide JCB in a shortened time frame for use by the combat Soldier operating in hot, wet tropical jungle conditions. The JCB must be domestically produced in compliance with Section 2533a of Title 10 U.S. Code (known as the "Berry Amendment") and be capable of meeting the technical requirements specified in the attached Purchase Description (PD, see Attachment 001).</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT'S INTENDED USE OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Government intends to use the information received from Industry as a result of this RFI and the planned Industry Day (details below) to determine Industry capability to meet PdM-SCIE's DR immediate need to field to two (2) BCTs with an expectation that this information may reasonably lead directly to contract awards for production of JCB to support this Directed Requirement and a formal solicitation may not be issued prior to entering into contracts. The information gathered will be used as market research and will be used to determine the Army's contracting strategy, including the potential use of competitive, limited competition, and/or non-competitive actions, to meet this immediate need to field two BCTs based upon Industry's capability to meet technical, quality, price, and delivery schedule requirements. Therefore, the information provided should be accurate and thorough enough to clearly demonstrate a company's capability to execute to the schedules provided. The Government will independently review the information received as part of this RFI to determine a company's capability to meet this DR JCB effort.</p>
<p>It is critical for Industry to note that this DR is separate from the larger, Program of Record (POR) requirement to field the Army with a JCB. The POR is the long-term solution and is still currently proceeding through the normal Defense Acquisition Framework. Additional market research will be conducted in the future to determine Industry's capability to meet the larger requirements of the Program of Record JCB.</p>
<p>JCB DIRECTED REQUIREMENT SCHEDULE AND SIZING NEEDS</p>
<p>Interested parties shall articulate responses in a clear and concise manner for the Government to review to determine each respondent's capability to manufacture and meet the Government's Directed Requirement for 36,000 pair of JCB boots. Each company should provide different scenarios for consideration by the Government if able to exceed the required schedule and sizes or if unable to meet it. Each company should also provide the best schedule and size tariff for their production considerations. For comparative basis, please use an anticipated contract award date of 1 December 2016 to describe production lead time and delivery capability. If an earlier contract award date is required to meet schedule, please advise the latest date you would be able to receive a contract award and be able to deliver in accordance with the requirements below.</p>
<p>1. Phase I: Initial Fielding of First BCT<br />a. The Government aims to field one BCT by March 2017. To accomplish this, the Government requires the maximum amount or pairs of JCB in sizes of 8 &frac12; -11 (whole and half sizes) in Regular (D) and Wide (EE) width identified in Tariff 1 (Attachment 002), to be delivered to Hawaii no later than 28 February 2017 that meet the Purchase Description requirements. The maximum total should not exceed 2,500 pairs. The Government's goal is to get as many pair of JCB fielded by the end of March as possible and request Industry's input as to how to achieve that goal including sizes in accordance with Tariff 2 (Attachment 003). <br />2. Phase II: Completion of Fielding First BCT and Field Second BCT<br />a. The Government aims to complete fielding of the first BCT and field a second BCT no later than 29 September 2017 for a total fielding of 36,000 pair of JCBs to the two BCTs in the DR. Additional production and delivery capability will be for sizes 3 through 15 (whole and half sizes) and 16 (whole size only) in widths Narrow (B), Regular (D), Wide (EE), and X-Wide (EEEE).</p>
<p>RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI must provide a logical, concise, and clear answer to the requested information, questions, and scenarios contained within this RFI within 30 calendar days of the issuance of this RFI (no later than 03 NOV 2016 at 12:00 PM EST) describing their ability to produce the JCB as described in Attachment 001 while meeting all of the requirements of this Directed Requirement, including schedule and cost.</p>
<p>Responses should be no more than fifteen (15) pages in length (excluding Test Reports and certifications) and can be in Contractor's format and submitted in a PDF document by email (Jay.McNamara.civ@mail.mil) or hardcopy submission to: Mr. Jay McNamara, US Army NSRDEC, 15 General Greene Ave., Bldg 4, D-323, Natick, MA 01760-5019.</p>
<p>The information package shall contain the following items:<br />1. Detailed information regarding the firm's domestic production capabilities and relevant prior experience, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items, including contract numbers. <br />2. An estimated price per pair of boots, including any quantity discounts and range pricing, if known, shall be provided. If pricing is dependent upon contract minimum and/or order size, a matrix correlating price to quantity shall be provided for a range from a minimum of 1,000 pairs to a maximum of 36,000 pairs. Price should include cost of shipping to Hawaii. <br />a. Provide estimated shipping costs (independent of boot price) associated with each order size to each of the following locations: Schofield Barracks, HI; and Lansing, MI for comparative analysis by the Government. <br />3. A list of sources for all component materials to be used in the production of the boot, including name and style/product number of the component (when relevant), component manufacturer address, and a primary point of contact for the component manufacture (i.e. name and phone number or email address). Test reports of component and/or end item testing to validate the meeting of PD (Attachment 001) requirements may be submitted if available, but are not necessary at this time. Absence of component/end item test reports from the submission package will not negatively impact a firm's ability to demonstrate capability for any potential resulting JCB contract awards following this RFI.<br />4. Available production capacity and ability to deliver the boots as described in the PD (Attachment 001) and in sizing matching Tariff 1 (see Attachment 002), beginning no later than 28 February 2017 and continuing monthly thereafter.<br />a. Minimum first delivery should be no less than 1,000 pair. Maximum total for sizes identified in Tariff 1 (Attachment 002) should not exceed 2,500 pair. If minimum first delivery cannot be met, firms should specify what quantity (including tariff with sizes and widths) they can deliver to Hawaii no later than 28 February 2017.<br />b. Provide the latest date when your company would need a contract award in place to begin delivering by for each scenario presented in your response, and critically for the February 2017 deliveries, if other than 1 December 2016.<br />c. Clearly articulate if a wider range of sizes can be delivered by 28 February and what impact that would have on the quantity delivered and price (increase or decrease and at what quantities).<br />d. Indicate if deliveries can be made earlier than the 28 February 2017 date.<br />5. Assuming 14 April 2017 award of second order for Phase II, please provide a schedule to produce and deliver additional sizes, as described in Tariff 2 (Attachment 003). Final delivery should not occur later than September 2017 and maximum total number of boots delivered should not exceed 36,000 pairs across Phase I and Phase II.<br />a. Provide a continuing delivery schedule after the first delivery, to include delivery dates, and weekly/monthly production capability.<br />b. Explain how the size tariff can be increased from Tariff 1 (Attachment 002) to Tariff 2 (Attachment 003) moving forward from the 28 February 2017 delivery to encompass the full range of sizes by indicating the number of sizes/widths that can be added per delivery.<br />6. A single product sample (size 10R) Production Demonstration Model (PDM) may be submitted as part of the RFI response, if available prior to the closing of the RFI, however it is not required. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample and samples will not be returned.<br /><br />JCB DIRECTED REQUIREMENT INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>The Government will host a Jungle Combat Boot Industry Day. This Industry Day will only address the Directed Requirement for two (2) BCT deliveries of JCB by September 2017. It will not address the Program of Record JCB that is still in process of being developed following delivery of the DR requirement. Due to meeting space and time constraints, attendance is limited solely to Berry Compliant Prime Footwear Contractors that are interested in providing a JCB solution to meet this immediate Directed Requirement. Prime Contractors are limited to no more than four (4) individuals per prime due to meeting space constraints. Questions regarding the JCB requirement that have been submitted to Mr. Jay McNamara via email (Jay.McNamara.civ@mail.mil) prior to COB 14 October will be addressed at the Industry Day General Session. Additional information will be provided through an amendment to this posting in the near future.</p>
<p>1. When: Thursday, October 20, 2016 starting at 1230 (see schedule below)<br />2. Location: Crowne Plaza Philadelphia-Cherry Hill, 2349 Marlton Pike W, Cherry Hill, NJ 08002<br />3. General Session: 1230-1330<br />4. Individual Break-out sessions will be hosted by the Government with interested participants for no more than 25 minute sessions beginning every half hour from 1330-1700. Time slot availability will be on a first-come, first-served basis. If you are representing a prime and interested in signing up for a 25 minute one-on-one JCB session please reserve your company's time slot by providing the following information to Mr. McNamara via email by COB 13 October 2016 with the following information: Company Name &amp; Address, Attendee Names &amp; Title of Company Representatives. Mr. McNamara will then assign a one-on-one time slot. If only attending for the general session, please provide the same information to Mr. McNamara and then advise appropriately in your email.</p>

<DESC>NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes to meet a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAâ€™s three (3) Bombardier CL-601 aircraft.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain approval for required Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) necessary to make these aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification will upgrade the current avionics suite and equipment (currently a 1995 version similar to that found on the Lear Jet 60 standard avionics suite configuration) to an FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics suite configuration in addition to meeting all 2020 ADS-B Out mandates and must include the following avionics systems:

  â€¢Future Air Navigation (FANS) 1/A with Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)
  â€¢R3 Global Positioning Systems (GPS) â€“ Install Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capable GPS
  â€¢Flight Management System (FMS) â€“ Introduction of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) AR 0.3 capability
  â€¢Weather Radar System â€“ Multi-scan Weather Radar
  â€¢ATC Transponder System â€“ Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B DO-260B) 

The FAA is open to all upgrades that provide the aircraft with the mandated 2020 avionics capabilities and requirements to enable them to fly anywhere in the world.  The FAA does prefer that a proposed upgrade is based on the ProLine 21 Avionics Suites with Advanced Avionics capability similar to that called out in Service Bulletins 605-34-019 and 605-00-003 Rev. 11; based on efficiencies from fleet standardization of aircraft systems.  The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on the first aircraft, taking into consideration the following

  â€¢Cost of engineering
  â€¢Time and cost of de-installation of old systems--taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new equipment
  â€¢Time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and
  â€¢Time and cost to obtain the required certifications and STCs to have the first aircraft flying fully certified.  

In addition to the Learjet 60 Avionics system installed on the FAAâ€™s CL-601 aircraft, the FAA has added additional modifications to the aircraft that may be impacted by the requirement to upgrade.  Some of the systems below will require the vendor to remove and replace with new updated avionics equipment/systems; new wiring; and cabling harness.  Other system listed below will stay on the aircraft but will require integration to work with the newly installed avionics equipment and systems.  A list of these supplemental modifications is shown below.  Those marked with (**) are systems that will stay on the aircraft after modification and may be required to interface with the new avionics systems to be installed:

  â€¢**Passenger Oxygen Systems -- SA5940SW thru Rev 01
  â€¢**AVIAC Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Systems -- ST00210WI thru Rev. B
  â€¢**Auxiliary Power System, .PAT, -- ST0033NY through Rev 02
  â€¢Collins ProLine 4 Avionics System -- ST00226WI-D, Rev F 
  â€¢FIAS Configuration AFIS Equipment SA9171SC-D thru Rev 02
  â€¢**Vapor Cycle System (VCS) â€“ SA9176SC-D thru Rev 02
  â€¢Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) â€“ SA9177SC-D, Original
  â€¢Parker /Gull Navigation Computer unit (NCU) SA2136SW-AC, Rev 01
  â€¢AFIS Enhancements Supp. No. S09645, Rev 01
  â€¢**UHF Secure Voice (KY058) Systems â€“ S09470, Original
  â€¢UNS-1Fw Flight Management Systems â€“ S09475, Rev 04
  â€¢**Radio Frequency Interface (RFI) Direction-Finding (DF) System, S09478, Original
  â€¢**Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) â€“ S09481, Rev 02
  â€¢**IFF Transponder â€“ S09091, Rev 01
  â€¢**Emergency Vision Assurance Systems (EVAS) ST01012WI, Rev 2
  â€¢**TAS EVS-1000 Enhanced Vision System (EVS) ST01440LA, Rev C
  â€¢**LAIRCAM System, AN/AAQ-24(V) Missile Defense System S09640, Rev 02
  â€¢Multi-Mode Receiver, GNLU-955M S09638, Rev 01
  â€¢Teledyne Controls Flight Data Acquisition Unit and an L-3 Comm Flight Data Recorder â€“ S09494, Original
  â€¢**HF-9000 Communications System (HF-9010 Control) â€“S80004, Original

As stated above, this Market Survey is requesting information from vendors who have business experience in upgrading and modifying general aviation jet aircraft to meet the FAAâ€™s 2020 ADS-B Out mandate.  

The information requested at this time is for planning purposes only and for the development of a source list.  The FAA needs sound cost and time estimations on the effort it will take to bring the FAAâ€™s Challenger 601 aircraft (22 years old or older) to sustain flying another 10 to 15 years; and, meets both FAA and ICAO avionics standards.  As a part of this Market Survey, we ask interested vendors to complete Attachment A to this survey.  The information needs to be provided as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).  This form requests information on:

  â€¢Cost of non-recurring engineering required for STC preparation and submittal for approval
  â€¢Time and cost of old systems/equipment removal
  â€¢Time and cost for installation of new equipment /Systems wiring and cabling upgraded, and 
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new avionics systems/equipment on the aircraft and meet the FAA and ICAO requirements for 2020 flights in the U.S. or anywhere in the world.  

The information in Attachment A is broken out for the first aircraft (aircraft to be submitted for STC approval) and then follow-on installations of that approved STC on the second and third CL-601 aircraft.  

Any information provided information will be determined to be proprietary to each vendor if provided with proprietary markings and will only be seen by FAA personnel and will not be released.

<DESC>AMENDMENT A001:  THE CLOSING DATE FOR THIS MAREKT SURVEY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO CLOSE OF BUSINES, OCTOBER 28, 2016.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes to meet a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAâ€™s three (3) Bombardier CL-601 aircraft.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain approval for required Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) necessary to make these aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification will upgrade the current avionics suite and equipment (currently a 1995 version similar to that found on the Lear Jet 60 standard avionics suite configuration) to an FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics suite configuration in addition to meeting all 2020 ADS-B Out mandates and must include the following avionics systems:

  â€¢Future Air Navigation (FANS) 1/A with Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)
  â€¢R3 Global Positioning Systems (GPS) â€“ Install Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capable GPS
  â€¢Flight Management System (FMS) â€“ Introduction of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) AR 0.3 capability
  â€¢Weather Radar System â€“ Multi-scan Weather Radar
  â€¢ATC Transponder System â€“ Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B DO-260B) 

The FAA is open to all upgrades that provide the aircraft with the mandated 2020 avionics capabilities and requirements to enable them to fly anywhere in the world.  The FAA does prefer that a proposed upgrade is based on the ProLine 21 Avionics Suites with Advanced Avionics capability similar to that called out in Service Bulletins 605-34-019 and 605-00-003 Rev. 11; based on efficiencies from fleet standardization of aircraft systems.  The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on the first aircraft, taking into consideration the following

  â€¢Cost of engineering
  â€¢Time and cost of de-installation of old systems--taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new equipment
  â€¢Time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and
  â€¢Time and cost to obtain the required certifications and STCs to have the first aircraft flying fully certified.  

In addition to the Learjet 60 Avionics system installed on the FAAâ€™s CL-601 aircraft, the FAA has added additional modifications to the aircraft that may be impacted by the requirement to upgrade.  Some of the systems below will require the vendor to remove and replace with new updated avionics equipment/systems; new wiring; and cabling harness.  Other system listed below will stay on the aircraft but will require integration to work with the newly installed avionics equipment and systems.  A list of these supplemental modifications is shown below.  Those marked with (**) are systems that will stay on the aircraft after modification and may be required to interface with the new avionics systems to be installed:

  â€¢**Passenger Oxygen Systems -- SA5940SW thru Rev 01
  â€¢**AVIAC Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Systems -- ST00210WI thru Rev. B
  â€¢**Auxiliary Power System, .PAT, -- ST0033NY through Rev 02
  â€¢Collins ProLine 4 Avionics System -- ST00226WI-D, Rev F 
  â€¢FIAS Configuration AFIS Equipment SA9171SC-D thru Rev 02
  â€¢**Vapor Cycle System (VCS) â€“ SA9176SC-D thru Rev 02
  â€¢Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) â€“ SA9177SC-D, Original

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to cancel the solicitation in its entirety. The EPA did not clearly state its requirement in the current Statement of Work for this solicitation. EPA did not adequately describe its intended uses of the data (e.g., rulemaking and development of other policies) which necessitates that EPA be able to publish and disclose certain types of analyses of the data. Such uses might also require that EPA be able to retain raw data it uses in its analyses for a minimum of three (3) years, in order to comply with records retention schedules under the Federal Records Act. Furthermore, FAR 12.211 requires solicitations and contracts for technical data to include appropriate data rights provisions and clauses, but such provisions and clauses were not included in the solicitation. Finally, the EPA cannot agree to many of the standard terms and conditions included in licenses, including, but not limited to, indemnification provisions, statements to the affect that the license represents the entirety of the agreement between EPA and the vendor, and terms requiring disputes to be resolved by arbitration or in state courts under state law. A new solicitation will be forthcoming to address these issues in more detail.

The third-party evaluator will request information from small business voucher recipients annually for five (5) years after voucher commencement. Voucher recipients are expected to complete a web survey necessitating no more than 30 minutes of the respondent&rsquo;s time each year. The survey questions will seek information from respondents such as: satisfaction with pilot participation processes and pilot services received; interest in subsequent lab assistance; technology development status; commercialization advancements; intellectual property created; follow-on funding attained; and product sales, if any. Time and cost incurred to comply with these reporting requirements can be included in a requester&rsquo;s cost share contribution. </span></p>

First, an external (non-lab) merit review committee will review each RFA and the result of that review will inform which RFAs will continue to the next step in the review process. Second, labs will work with DOE to determine the optimal lab-company match to enter into the semi-finalist review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Semi-finalists will be matched with a lab researcher. The lab and the semi-finalists will have approximately 4 weeks to work to develop a brief statement of work and budget, which will be presented to DOE for consideration. Third, the labs will present the proposed projects to DOE for final review and selection. The DOE Technology Offices will select SBV projects relevant to their technological focus. After selections, the labs will enter into final negotiations with the requesters for the selected projects. </span></p>

The third-party evaluator will request information from small business voucher recipients annually for five (5) years after voucher commencement. Voucher recipients are expected to complete a web survey necessitating no more than 30 minutes of the respondent&rsquo;s time each year. The survey questions will seek information from respondents such as: satisfaction with pilot participation processes and pilot services received; interest in subsequent lab assistance; technology development status; commercialization advancements; intellectual property created; follow-on funding attained; and product sales, if any. Time and cost incurred to comply with these reporting requirements can be included in a requester&rsquo;s cost share contribution. </span></p>

First, an external (non-lab) merit review committee will review each RFA and the result of that review will inform which RFAs will continue to the next step in the review process. Second, labs will work with DOE to determine the optimal lab-company match to enter into the semi-finalist review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Semi-finalists will be matched with a lab researcher. The lab and the semi-finalists will have approximately 4 weeks to work to develop a brief statement of work and budget, which will be presented to DOE for consideration. Third, the labs will present the proposed projects to DOE for final review and selection. The DOE Technology Offices will select SBV projects relevant to their technological focus. After selections, the labs will enter into final negotiations with the requesters for the selected projects. </span></p>

USAHA's mission is to protect animal and public health by serving as a national forum for communication and coordination concerning disease eradication, animal health, emergency preparedness, emergency response and recovery, emerging diseases and food safety. USAHA works with state and federal governments, universities, veterinarians, livestock producers, national livestock and poultry organizations, research scientists, the extension service and seven foreign countries to control livestock diseases in the United States.

<DESC>Department of Justice<br />Federal Bureau of Prisons<br />Justification for Brand Name Items<br />This procurement is being conducted in accordance with the ordering procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.5 - Indefinite-Delivery Contracts. Under FAR 16.505 Ordering, Contracting Officers are required to document the<br />circumstances when soliciting brand name items. Therefore, in accordance with FAR 16.505 (a)(4)(ii)"Requirements for use of items peculiar to one manufacturer shall be justified and approved using the format(s) and requirements from paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A),(B), and (C) of this section, modified to show the brand-name justification". 1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity - U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons(Bureau), Central Office, Administration Division ,Acquisitions Branch , National Acquisitions Section.2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved-This action will be a 1 year delivery<br />order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the<br />National Aeronautics and Space Administration Solutions forEnterprise-Wide Procurement V (NASA-SEWP V) Government-Wide<br />Acquisition Contract (GWAC). The acquisition is for Virtual<br />Imaging SecurePASS contraband detection systems extended<br />maintenance and support.<br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet<br />the agency 's needs including estimated value-<br />The Bureau has a requirement for maintenance and support of<br />the contraband detection systems. These systems prevent<br />weapons or other contraband from entering the institutions,<br />which could compromise the safety and security of these<br />facilities. A delay in maintenance and support could cause<br />a life or safety hazard.<br />The Bureau has already procured 81 contraband detection<br />systems. The Bureau currently<br />deploys a number of electronic devices used to detect<br />contraband on the person such as metal detectors,<br />electronic drug and alcohol detection devices, low dose<br />backscatter x-ray body scan devices, etc. However, none of<br />these devices are capable of detecting plastic, wood, and other non-metallic (organic) contraband inside the human body. Only medical x-rays can do that and medical x-rays are not normally used for routine inspection of inmates.<br />The Bureau needs a device that capable of screening high<br />volumes of inmates during receiving and discharging and<br />emits low dose radiation&nbsp;and that has been approved by the<br />Federal Drug Administration (FDA). These devices are be<br />used, in a continuing effort, to reduce the movement of<br />illegal contraband, specifically, metal and non-metallic<br />contraband that has been swallowed and/or concealed in body<br />cavities, by inmates. Institutions are reporting an<br />increase in the amount of contraband being secreted in body<br />cavities by inmates including non-metallic contraband<br />weapons being used to assault both inmates and staff.<br />Office of Security Technology (OST) has been following the<br />development of contraband detection technologies for many<br />years including technologies currently being tested by the<br />TSA such as low dose backscatter x-ray, millimeter wave,<br />thermal imaging, and low does transmission x-ray devices<br />such as the SecurPASS.<br />This acquisition is for maintenance and support of the<br />existing SecurPass x ray machines. The estimated cost for<br />the maintenance and support is $303,928.00.<br />4. Identification of exemption to fair opportunity - In<br />accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) the contracting<br />officer must justify restricting consideration to an item<br />peculiar to one manufacturer.<br />The Bureau has a requirement for a contraband detection<br />system capable of identifying items that have been<br />swallowed or concealed in body cavities of inmates.<br />To date, the SecurPASS is the only agency authorized<br />technology that provides acceptable imaging and has the<br />necessary Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) required<br />filters needed for our correctional environments in<br />detection of swallowed contraband and/or contraband<br />concealed in bodily cavities, and is safe and effective at meeting ANSI/HPS N43.17-2009 "Radiation Safety for Personnel Security Screening Systems Using X-Ray or Gamma Radiation"<br />standards.<br />5. A determination by the contracting officer that the<br />anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and<br />reasonable - The NASA-SEWP V Contracting Officer has already determined the price to be fair and reasonable<br />pursuant to FAR 15.305(a)(1) and FAR 15.403-1 (c)(1)(i)(B).<br />The Bureau contracting officer anticipates that the price<br />will be fair and reasonable after reviewing the Product<br />Price Index Industry Data at bls.gov(Bureau of Labor<br />Statistics website).

<DESC>Pursuant to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subparts 13.106-1(b)(1)and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy (BPAP) Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons has determined there is only one source reasonably available. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.501(a)(1)(ii).<br />1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting<br />activity - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons (Bureau), Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.<br />2. Nature and/or Description of Action being approved - The Bureau's Office of Information Policy and Public Affairs Division (IPPA) has a Congressional mandate to obtain criminal history records from all states and the District of Columbia. Nlets is the only source available that provides parsed criminal histories for the research requirements of the Second Chance Act. This acquisition will incorporate a fixed firm-price order and cover the performance period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017. Nlets is the only source available that provides parsed criminal histories for the research requirements of the Second Chance Act.<br />3. Description of Supplies/Services required to meet the Agency's Needs including the estimated value - In order for the Bureau to fulfill the requirement of obtaining criminal history records, it has been determined that Nlets is the only source that can provide the services. The acquisition of Nlets annual membership will enable the Bureau to meet research requirements of the Second Chance Act of 2007(SCA). Membership will allow the Bureau to obtain a parsed data file used for analyzing recidivism rates and program evaluations. Nlets provides access to a helpdesk and a project manager assigned to the Bureau.<br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition - The statutory authority permitting the sole source acquisition is provided when using simplified procedures for certain commercial items under 41 U.S.C. 1901- Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The use of this authority is appropriate pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.501(a) as the circumstances of this action deem only a single source is reasonably available.<br />5. Determination that proposed Contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited - This justification is being submitted for approval in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1), since there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Nlets owns sole proprietary rights to the Nlets network and has not granted reseller authority to other vendors. Therefore, the membership required to access the network cannot be obtained from any other source.<br />6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practical, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies - The notice to award a sole source contract is not required to be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, fedbizopps.gov in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(13)(i).<br />7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable - Through market research, comparison of pricing for other software systems for similar membership licensing using the Bureau of Labor Statistics database and from obtaining invoices from the vendor from their previous contracts, the Contracting Officer has determined the price for the renewal of annual membership licensing for the Nlets network is fair and reasonable.<br />8. A description of the market research conducted - Market research was conducted and it was determined that the licensing required to access the network cannot be obtained from any other source. Nlets has not granted reseller authority to any other vendors.<br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition - Lack of access to the Nlets would adversely impact Bureau's ability to meet requirements of the (SCA). Manual efforts to collect and analyze information from all the states would be resource intensive and cost prohibitive for the agency. Without services provided by Nlets, the agency would not be able to meet the mandatory research requirements in the (SCA).
