<DESC>RECOVERY ACT PROJECT - The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 2121 North Avenue, Grand Junction, CO is soliciting offers to design/build project entitled "Replace Site Underground Electrical Feeds, Phase 2".  THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS IAW PUBLIC LAW 109-461. This is a design-build construction project.  This project will upgrade the existing underground cable/cable components in manholes and specified transformers of the underground electric distribution system at the Grand Junction VA Medical center.  The project will determine feasibility of backup power connection for Building 8 from generator plant located at Building 33.  This contract anticipates the removal and replacement of manhole to manhole cabling, manhole racks, terminations and connections and transformers.  The existing manholes with storm drainage piping will have that piping auger cleaned.  Existing manholes without storm drain piping will have existing sump pumps replaced or new pumps installed.Design of this project by a licensed electrical engineer will include a load analysis of the system, load analysis of four (4) pad mounted transformers and the replacement of four (4) pad mounted transformers with one (1) associated switch.  The Architect/Engineer is expected to provide a design for replacement of the site underground electrical feed system, analyze capacity for current needs and for anticipated 20% electrical consumption increase.  The Architect/Engineer is expected to utilize existing drawings, project specifications and on-site surveys in the development of the design.  Above surface cubicles for connection and/or switching may be utilized in the design.A power load survey will include the capacity of generator plant EE8201, load of Building 33 and load of Building 8.  Data developed from the survey will determine if Building 8 could be connected to EE8201.  If the connection to Building 8 is feasible, the design would provide for Building 8 backup power service via a sized transfer switch.   The design will anticipate the use of copper conductor cabling.  All interruptions of electrical service will be scheduled and coordinated with Engineering Service.  Installing personnel will comply with all regulations and requirements for confined and restricted spaces.  HISTORYThe VA electrical system is fed from two (2) XCEL ENERGY sources; XCEL designated "preferred" and "alternate".  XCEL Energy provides 13.2 kilovolts to the VA main switch cubicle.  The VA main switch and distribution system is 29+ years old. Transformers have had preventive maintenance which included Hi-Pot testing and oil analysis.  Oil analysis verifies NO PCB Several instances of load break connector failure in manholes have occurred.  The geographical site of the Grand Junction VA Medical Center has a very high ground water level jeopardizing the subsurface connections of high voltage connections.  New structures have been constructed on the site, adding electrical load to the distribution network.  The work of this project will include all cabling and devices on the cables in manhole No.3 and termination with cables in manhole No.4.  Transformers located adjacent to the south wing Building 1 (2 each), Building 8 and Building 5 are expected to be replaced due to enclosure and liquid age.  All work will be in accordance with plans, specifications and current editions of the International Building Code, National Electric Code, National Plumbing Code, NFPA, OSHA and comply with the current edition of the VA Master Specifications available at the following web site (www.cfm.va.gov). The project number is R575-10-101. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal in accordance with Public Law 109-461 as codified by 38 USC 8127 and 8128 as a TOTAL SET-ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES (SDVOSB).

<RESPDATE>112709
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Animal Resource Program (ARP) plans to procure on a sole source basis a Maintenance Agreement for the Government owned IVIS Lumina (s/n IS0735N4329); IVIS Lumina (s/n IS0631N3982); IVIS 100** (s/n IS0707N4120) systems with Caliper LifeSciences; 68 Elm Street; Hopkinton, Maine 01748-1602.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $7M.  

The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.

The animal optical imaging systems listed above are a programmatic resource for CCR and currently all three IVIS optical imagers need maintenance performed.  In order to assure that these instruments are available and in good working conditions at all times for research staff, a service protection plan is needed. This plan must include a full year of service as well as unlimited support when needed during that period to include: replacement parts (new), repair services on-site as well as access to technicians 24 hours a day with a reasonable response time (no greater than 72 hours).

The purpose of this requirement is associated specifically with the need for maintenance contracts for all three government-owned IVIS Lumina systems. Since Caliper LifeSciences is the manufacturer of the instruments, the maintenance is necessary from the same vendor to ensure optimal use and guarantee that efficiently trained technicians perform any service that may be needed. 

It is critical to the research community currently using the instrument that all service be performed by the same vendor that manufactured and implemented the equipment in the lab. It is imperative that the system is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturers specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could run distort information or disrupt studies currently in process on the instrument. Technicians to be provided from the vendor are factory trained, have access to technical manuals relating specifically to the system including recall notices. In addition, proprietary software and replacement parts are available only through Caliper LifeSciences to supply and service their instruments. 

Finally, Caliper LifeSciences is the only company that stocks or has access to the specific parts needed to maintain the function of the system and offer proprietary software upgrades as well. For these reasons, no other source is known to the NCI capable of providing the service on the IVIS Lumina (s/n IS0735N4329); IVIS Lumina (s/n IS0631N3982); IVIS 100** (s/n IS0707N4120) systems currently in use by the Animal Resource Program.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on November 27, 2009.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Ashley Virts at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-100015-AV on all correspondence.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB) plans to procure on a sole source basis a Maintenance Agreement for the following Government owned systems: Becton-Dickinson FACScan (s/n 83023); Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur (s/n E5196 - 4 color); Becton-Dickinson FACS Flow Supply System (s/n N1227); FACSARIA 3-Laser System, (s/n P22300031); 
FACSCALIBUR 4CLR System, (s/n E20200198); FACS FLOW Supply System, (s/n N1813); FACS FLOW Supply System, (s/n N2468); LSRII SPECIAL (s/n H47100178);
Laser Component of (s/n H47100178), Sapphire 488-100 Blue Laser (s/n 3954); Laser Component of (s/n H47100178), 640-40 Red Laser (s/n 3955); Laser Component of (s/n) H47100178), 594-50 Yellow Laser (s/n 4214); Laser Component of (s/n H47100178), Violet Laser 50 MW (s/n 3956); Laser Component of (s/n H47100178), UV 100mW Laser (s/n 3953) with BD Biosciences; 2350 Qume Drive; San Jose, CA 35131-1807.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $7M.  

The period of performance shall be for twelve months from December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010.

Currently, the EIB houses the systems in four rooms on NIHs Main Campus. The instruments are in use daily by laboratory personnel to perform scientific research geared towards the mission of the NCI. The systems and there components are used heavily and considered an essential part in daily studies. For these reasons, it is imperative that a maintenance agreement be enacted in order to keep all machines running proficiently and for immediate access to service bulletins that occur over the next twelve months.

The purpose of this requirement is associated specifically with the need for a maintenance contract for the aforementioned systems and there components. BD Biosciences is only the manufacturer of some of the instruments indicated above, yet is the only vendor capable of providing comparable local field engineer force and access to specialized Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts required for service and/or OEM software modifications.  

It is critical to the research community currently using the instruments that all service be performed by a vendor capable of all maintenance required to include not only standard replacement parts and upgrades, but specialized OEM components for each system as well as OEM software which was implemented originally with the equipment in the lab. It is imperative that the system is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturers specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could run distort information or disrupt studies currently in process on the instrument. Technicians to be provided from the vendor are factory trained, have access to technical manuals relating specifically to the all systems including recall notices. In addition, proprietary software and replacement parts are available only through BD Biosciences to supply and service their included instruments. Specifically, this requirement is critically important due to the nature of the work in the EIB core facility.  More than 75% of the work is with freshly explanted, or very short term cultured (hours) cells prepared from various mouse organs.  These cells are extremely fragile and die less than 12 hours after they are harvested.   Some of the mice used are genetically modified and are extremely valuable with some experiments requiring up to 100 mice to complete.  Therefore, these experiments are extraordinarily expensive to perform.  If a flow cytometer malfunctions, but can be repaired within 4-6 hours, the experiment will be a contribution even though the mice have already been sacrificed.  BD Biosciences has 5 local service engineers, and usually one or more of them are at NIH on any given day.  This response is only possible with a sizeable local service force.  For these reasons, no other source is known to the NCI capable of providing service to include all specifications of the labs needs.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on November 27, 2009.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Ashley Virts at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-100014-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento requires its assigned aircraft to be regularly washed to help prevent corrosion and to otherwise keep aircraft appearances up to standard. Our existing wash rack system includes 2 boost pumps, 1 large gas fired water heater, plumbing for both hot & cold water and a hise station with 2 hoses ( 1 hot water and 1 cold water) with assosiated reels and nozzles. There are 3 stations to the system. Station 1 contains water line of main water source with 1st boost pump. Station 2 is the water heater and tank and 2nd boost pump. Station 3 is hot and cold water hoses reels and nozzles, 2 back flow preventors and 2 hose pressure sensors that operate drainage controls.

Over the last 2 years we have had a series of problems with our system that has led us to the need to overhaul it. We have had a series of underground plumbing failures, we have also had problems with older gas fired water heater, not only has it required a great deal of maintenance it has also failed emissions with little hope that it will ever be in compliance. Our overall vision is to have all 3 stations collocated with an electric type on demand hot water filteration system with all assosiated hot and cold water plumbing.

This is a Performance Type Contract. The USCG's intent is to recieve from the contractor a "Complete and usuable" product that meets all functional requirements as well as all codes and regulations of applicable govermental agencies.

Contracter must be registered in CCR.

In no event will failure of a contractor to submit questions or inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.  
9.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.

<DESC>RECOVERY - Any award resulting from this Sources Sought Notice is anticipated to be funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Large Format, High Speed, High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector System in support of projects in NISTs Physics Laboratory. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Large Format, High Speed, High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector System that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.

NIST has a need for a Large Format, High Speed, High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector System that would meet the following requirements:

A.	Detector Electronics Performance
	
		1.	A field of view that is 10 cm by 10 cm, plus or minus 1 cm on each side.

		2.	A detector spatial resolution better than 20 micrometers, as measured with neutrons, where the spatial resolution is defined from the point at which the modulation transfer function reaches 10 % of its maximum value (10 % MTF).

		3.	The dead time correction of the readout electronics must be less than 10 % for a global random event rate of 4 MHz, while maintaining a spatial resolution of 20 micrometers at 10 % MTF.

		4.	The intrinsic noise of the detector must be less than 0.75 events per second per squared centimeter.

		5.	Must be provided with all necessary readout electronics.

		6.	A pixel pitch of 10 micrometers or less.

		7.	The closest approach to the front face of the neutron sensitive element of the detector will be no more than 1 cm.  The detector housing will be less than 30.5 cm (12 inches) in diameter, and less than 5 cm (2 inches) in width.  The detector housing will have tapped holes for 1/4-20 bolts (quarter-twenty) along the circumference or on the back of the housing for mounting.  Required electronics may extend beyond the specified detector housing volume, but must be able to be shielded from the incident and scattered neutron beam.

		8.	Image acquisition must be computer controlled.  Control includes setting an arbitrary image acquisition time, setting the pixel pitch and image size, and initiating image acquisition through either ActiveX controls, macro scripts, text file communication, or other appropriate means.  The image acquisition software will be able to save images in either the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) or TIF (Tagged Image Format) file formats as 8-bit and 16-bit integers.  The image acquisition software will run natively in Windows XP.

B.	Neutron Sensitive Component

		9.	A thermal neutron (neutron energy of 25 meV (millielectron volts)) detection efficiency of at least 15 %.

		10.	Neutron sensitive portion has a minimum lifetime of 1000 hours in a neutron beam with a fluence rate of 1,000,000 per squared centimeter per second.

		11.	The neutron sensitive portion of the detector will be able to be separated from the readout electronics (such as ancillary signal processing equipment such as NIM modules and/or a computer) with cables up to 10 meters in length.  This separation is required to keep the electronics out of a high radiation area.

		12.	One billet each of three different sets of MCP (multichannel plate) neutron conversion plates, with a yield of 5 to 10 finished MCP neutron conversion plates per billet.  The characteristics of each set of the neutron conversion plates are:

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT

Synopsis: 
THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS)  CODE APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:   221 UTILITIES
THIS IS NOT A REQEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, PWD Pensacola, FL, intends to award a contract to one source (The City of Pensacola d/b/a Energy Services of Pensacola) under the authority of 10 U.S.C  2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation.  This contract is referred to as Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC).   
The UESC award is for various Energy Conservation Measures in specified areas within the Naval Station Pensacola as a result of a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms offered to its most favored customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile.  Therefore, contractor will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (14 year) amortization schedule.    
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.  The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Responses to this posting must be submitted to alice.oberhausen@navy.mil in PDF format no later than 27 November 2009.

<DESC>The Navy is developing Electromagnetic (EM) Railgun systems for long-range volume-fires missions.  To drive these EM-launchers, a high-energy and high-average-power pulsed power system (PPS) is required that can operate repetitively at the firing rate of the launcher.  Of the different pulsed power technologies, PPS based on capacitor energy storage are considered the most appropriate for the Navy mission.  This type of PPS currently operates at the appropriate energy level in Railgun laboratory facilities, but is larger than required, and operates in single-shot mode (relatively low average power).  Over the past two years, ONR has been developing compact, rep-rate PPS designs, and seeks to build and demonstrate a system based on these or alternate designs.  Existing designs, design concepts, and capabilities are being sought.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is an initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  This Market Research and RFI is for planning only, and shall not be considered a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   The USG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Supplier Operations is contemplating an amendment to the solicitation, SPM2D1-07-R-0002, for Newborn Screening Services, which required all offerors to submit proposals by the closing date of September 25, 2009.  The amendment may revise the requirement for a Board Certified Genetic Counselor to allow the contractor to provide counseling and guidance from staff who have training and experience in newborn screening counseling and fall into one or more of the following specific categories: a Registered Nurse, a Masters in Public Health, a Genetic Counselor (via board certification and/or an MS in Genetic Counseling), a PhD in a related field, or an MD.  

The solicitation may also be revised to require contractors to accept specimens and release results at least 5 days per week (defined as business days) excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal Holidays (see the following website for listing of Federal Holidays:  http://www.opm.gov/Operating_Status_Schedules/fedhol) as opposed to six days per week,  Monday through Saturday.  In addition the solicitation may be revised to require that the contractors complete all testing and report test result information on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant web-based system not later than four business days following sample/Purchase Order receipt as opposed to being required to complete all testing and report test result information within seventy-two hours/three business days.

Furthermore, the solicitation may be amended to state that the methods used for the Newborn Screening testing should demonstrate the offerors capability and capacity to follow currently accepted laboratory practices that are same or similar to those found in the MMWR Recommendations and Reports Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Metabolic Disease Screening Among Newborns, April 13, 2001/Vol. 50/No. RR-3 in lieu of the requirement that the contracts meet and maintain compliance with the national quality assurance/quality control measures in the MMWR Recommendations and Reports Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Metabolic Disease Screening Among Newborns, April 13, 2001/Vol. 50/No. RR-3. 

If you are a provider of Newborn Screening Services who would have submitted a proposal in response to the subject solicitation had the substance of the above amendment been known to you prior to solicitation close, please respond to this RFI via email to the Contract Specialist, Thomas E. Rosenthal at thomas.rosenthal@dla.mil, and/or Contracting Officer, Eileen Motta at eileen.motta@dla.mil.   The deadline for all responses is December 2, 2009, 3:00 PM (EST).

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work to: De-water, clean, inspect, and repair R. F. Henry, Millers Ferry, and Claiborne Locks.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated in the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>USACE, MED, Winchester, VA proposes to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract with Bauer Compressors of Norfolk. VA. in accordance with the follwoing J&A:<BR><BR>Control N0. 09-018<BR><BR>Limited Source Justification and Approval (LSJ&A)<BR><BR>1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY:  Transatlantic Programs Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Winchester, VA.<BR><BR>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  Procure additional equipment from Bauer Compressors to resolve an air quality problem existing in the Chaparral Missile Maintenance Facility in Cairo, Egypt built under contract W912ER-06-C-0016. This facility was completed and turned over to the Egyptian Ministry of Defense in July 2008. The facility has a 3200 psi compressed air system used to test the missiles. During construction the high pressure compressed air system was procured from Bauer Compressors Inc. Bauer also provided installation of several pieces of the High Pressure compressed air system. Additionally Bauer provided technical assistance to the construction contractor during installation of the complete system. Following turnover of the facility the Egyptian Ministry of Defense contracted Madison Research Corporation (MRC) to operate the facility. During the activation of the facility it was identified that the high pressure compressed air system did not produce the extremely pure air necessary for the missile maintenance procedure. Many efforts were made to adjust the system to get the desired output to no avail. After several months of investigation the most economical correction of the problem would be to add the CPF 900 filter assembly manufactured by Bauer Compressor Inc. Bauer Compressor Inc is the only source capable of responding due to the changes required in the compressor manufactured and installed by Bauer to meet the critical air quality required. <BR><BR>3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES: <BR>   CPF900 filter with new receiver and accessories.  Estimated Cost:  $150,000.  <BR><BR>4.  AUTHORITY CITED:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (iii) and DFARS 206.302-1, Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.. <BR><BR>5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  Per FAR 6.302 (iii) allows for use of one responsible source. If any other source was used there would be a duplication of costs as well as a delay in fulfilling agency requirements and no other suppliers will satisfy mission requirements.<BR><BR>6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  During the efforts to resolve the situation other vendors were contacted to resolve the situation. They refused to participate due to their equipment being installed on competitors High Pressure Compressed Air System. The other issue identified during the search was the potential for failure resulting in property damage and serious bodily injury from a hybrid system (Bauer + other vendors equipment). <BR><BR>7.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:   Future acquisitions will follow DFARS Subpart 225.73  Acquisitions for Foreign Military Sales.<BR><BR>8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  The Armed Forces Export Act (AECA), section 42(c) prohibits using FMS non-repayable funds made available under this Act for procurement outside the United States without presidential approval.  No other sources were found for the Bauer CPF 900 filter assembly.<BR><BR>9.  INTERESTED SOURCES:  A notice of proposed contract action will be published IAW FAR 5.201.<BR><BR>10.  OTHER FACTORS:  None.<BR><BR>

Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor
employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources
are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this
contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures.
(d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the
government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including,
but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns.
(e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not
disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the
Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor
shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive
information both during and after contract performance.
(f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor
may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources.
(g) Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure
agreement furnished by DHS.
(h) The contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated
in this contract or approved by the COTR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this
contract. Any attempts by contractor personnel to gain access to any information technology resources not
expressly authorized by the statement of work, other terms and conditions in this contract, or as approved in
writing by the COTR, is strictly prohibited. In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate
actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved.
(i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience
while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a
condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).
(j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS
harmless from any unauthorized use and agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for
any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access.
(k) Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or
maintenance of Department IT systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of
the component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department's Chief Security Officer (CSO) and
the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted
only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted:
(1) The individual must be a legal permanent resident of the U. S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic
of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State;
(2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U. S. citizen; and
(3) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government.
(l) Contractors shall identify in their proposals the names and citizenship of all non-U.S. citizens proposed to work
under the contract. Any additions or deletions of non-U.S. citizens after contract award shall also be reported to
the contracting officer.

3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from
entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation
as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with
respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national
security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be
applied by substituting "more than 50 percent" for "at least 80 percent" each place it appears.
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986.
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic
corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)--
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or
indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of
a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the
domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the
domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial
business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or
organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
"Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of
section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign
incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted
domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated
entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section
835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all
of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date
which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be
treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or
distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid
the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6
U.S.C. 395 (b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic
partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable
interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) Warrants;
(ii) Options;
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) Convertible debt instruments;
(v) Others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to
reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the
purpose of section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

pursuant to 3009.104-74.
(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

C.	TECHNICAL CONTENT
1.0	Background.    
The Office of Naval Research is sponsoring feasibility studies to determine the feasibility of a pilot project that seeks to extend the genres of Massive Multiplayer Online Gaming and Alternate Reality Games to scenarios of interest to Navy. The title of the project is "Massive Multiplayer Online Wargame Leveraging the Internet (MMOWGLI)". By extending game play to a large pool of participants who can play out a scenario collectively online, it is envisioned that MMOWGLI will foster the exploration of many more novel combinations of ideas and interactions than available by traditional means. 
ONR plans on a crawl-walk-run approach to MMOWGLI, with the crawl stage consisting of a pilot. To that end, ONR is soliciting industry feedback on the feasibility of, and suggested approaches to, executing the MMOWGLI pilot, as described in the remainder of this document. Responses will be used by ONR to craft an eventual Statement of Work (SOW) which may, or may not, be competitively bid. 
2.0  BAA Goals. 
This is a TBAA for a feasibility study to describe the execution of a pilot, designed to demonstrate the marriage of a number of existing component technologies, methodologies, and genres into a unified whole. As such, it is envisioned that the primary innovation, and the primary effort involved in executing the pilot, will be the integration of existing components, and their application in a new way, rather than in the development of completely new software, codes, technologies, or genres. 
It is envisioned that the MMOWGLI pilot will draw from, and integrate, elements of the following technologies, methodologies, and genres: .	Alternate Reality Games .	Massive Multiplayer Games .	Large-n text based collaboration games and events .	Turn based strategy games .	2-D graphics, geospatial mapping tools .	Wiki's .	Web 2.0 collaboration tools 
The feasibility study will take into consideration the anticipated MMOWGLI pilot (which is anticipated to be competitively competed during 3rd Qtr FY10) will have a six month period of performance to complete, which culminates in a 3-move, non-deterministic, turn based strategy game, to be played by a large number of informed, but not necessarily expert, players distributed geographically while playing collaboratively online, over a period lasting up to several weeks.
3.0	Technical Requirements for the Pilot.  
The feasibility study will take into consideration the following technical requirements:
3.1 Number and type of players: 
It is anticipated that the number of players will be between 50 and 1000. Players will be drawn from a pool that includes military officers, government civilians, and government contractors. It is expected that players will be generally knowledgeable but not necessarily be Subject Matter Experts.3.2 Classification Environment: The game will be unclassified; however it will not be open or available to the general public. Respondents should be prepared to address game play within a restrictive information assurance environment.
3.3 Graphics Environment: 
For the purposes of the pilot, the graphics environment should be just enough, but not more than, that needed to facilitate the play of a turn based strategy game.
3.4  Flow of the Game (respondents should refer to GFI for more ): 
The game is non-deterministic and will be played in three moves that are related to, yet still distinct from, each other. It is conceivable that insights gleaned from game play during Moves One and Two may be used to modify Moves Two and Three respectively. Respondents should plan on some level of effort being dedicated to being part of the game controller team during game play, and to making changes to the scenarios of subsequent moves. Each move is anticipated to last between one to two weeks of calendar time, with one to two weeks of calendar time between moves for game controller activities. 
Move One - Protecting the Sea Lanes: Move One is designed to get the players engaged in the game - collaborating and thinking strategically. Players attend a major International Anti-Piracy Conference being convened under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization. Players, representing various anti-piracy stakeholders, sign up as members of various working groups which are tasked with addressing aspects of the piracy problem. Once formed into teams/working groups, the players will have tasking to address activities related to military and operational coordination, information sharing, and the operational role of the regional coordination center. The complete player tasking is contained in the attachment. What the players produce: working as part of collaborative teams, the players will produce n-# of multimedia responses to the tasking they receive, where n-# corresponds to the number of teams. Assignment of players into teams: To the maximum extent practical, it is the intent that game controllers allow the teams to self organize and self manage. Thus, it is conceivable that a distribution of team sizes will exist, including some that are very small and some that are very large. 
Move Two - Attacks at Sea: The scenario is multiple near simultaneous attacks on ships transiting the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa. Players would be self selecting and self organizing into collaborative teams of either Red (pirates) or Blue (US and Allied response). It is conceivable that players may have the option of signing up to be part of a third party as well, representing e.g. NGOs, other governments, etc, but this has not yet been determined. 
Players will be provided with a menu of Red forces to work with, Blue forces to work with, constraints on how much of each they can use, and a description of the targets. This will be government furnished information. The attachment has more complete details. The first action belongs to Red, who is tasked with developing a plan of attack, with a deadline. The players would then produce n-# of multimedia responses, where the response describes their plan of attack. Once the Red plans of attack are submitted, then Blue takes over. Blue teams may respond to as many of the Red plans of attack as they wish. Blue's output consists of n-# of multimedia responses, where the response describes their plan of defense/counter-attack to the various Red attacks. 
Move Three: The game continues with a final move consisting of a range of scenarios that are logical outcomes from Move Two. These scenarios include, but may not be limited to: .	Conducting a hostage rescue ashore .	Conducting a hostage rescue at sea .	Dismantling pirate base camps .	Disrupting the pirate support infrastructure ashore and/or overseas .	Helping the Somali Transitional National Government and Puntland officials restore order and the rule of law .	Developing a viable indigenous Somali Coast Guard .	Providing humanitarian assistance .	Others, potentially based on insights gleaned from play in Moves One or Two 
Teams will have the option of selecting which scenario(s) to play. The format of game play will mirror that of Move Two, this time with Blue owning the first action and Red having the response. The players would produce the same output as in Move Two, i.e. n-# of multimedia responses consisting of a plan of attack (for Blue) and a plan of response or counter-attack (for Red).
3.5  Unified User Interface (the MMOWGLI Appliance): As discussed earlier in this document, it is envisioned that the primary level of effort for the pilot will go toward integration of existing component technologies. To that end, respondents should address, to the maximum extent practical, having a unified user interface. In the ideal outcome, players and participants should be able to run a single program to participate meaningfully in the game.  The term "appliance" is being used to mean a unified system consisting of an integrated hardware and software deliverable. Upon initial entry, users will be given the opportunity to create an account to enter personal information such as education and professional background. The addition of interests and hobbies will be encouraged to create a well rounded profile. Information should be organized in such a way as to promote social networking and used by others as Teams self organize. 
An online help system will be will be available to user along with basic system usage training. Player responsibilities will be explained in this system and it should be accessible at any time. Help topics will cover tools provided by the MMOWGLI Appliance. 
Players will be guided to documentation/media library where they are exposed to an initial presentation of the scenarios and background information. Users will be presented with questions to answer and are provided with expectations of minimum satisfactory responses to be completed by the end of each move. Game controllers are people tasked with the duty of guiding game play. Players may be provided with additional information, injected by the game controllers, at any time. Game Controllers may answer questions and encourage teams to gel. Key questions may be posed during a move in response to player inputs. 
Players will have the ability to create, edit, share, and compartmentalize all content created and archived within the appliance. Content may be defined as documents (text, word processed, spreadsheets, and presentations), audio, and video. Users will have the ability to send alerts via instant messaging or email to team members when content has been added or changed. Players will be provided a suite of online collaboration tools where teams would be allowed to create private forums. The team may assign moderator rights to the leader. Teams would have public and private chat capabilities, allowing polling.
3.6  Scoring, Ranking, Adjudication and Other Factors Affecting Player Engagement: Respondents should address having a scheme for ranking and scoring players and teams both publicly and privately. The scheme should combine elements that are objective as well as subjective (i.e. determined by the game controllers). It is envisioned that these criteria would be made known to the players. Since the game is non-deterministic, it is envisioned that the game controller team will have to adjudicate winners and losers for each Move (i.e. human-in-the-loop).  In addition to the basics of scoring and ranking, respondents should address other aspects of game play that they assess as important to making the game experience meaningful.
3.7  Data: Data analysis will not be part of the pilot. However, it is envisioned that future ONR sponsored efforts may be aimed at conducting basic analysis of data collected during the pilot. Therefore, respondents should address a simple means of enabling the game controllers to tag data for later retrieval and analysis.
3.8  Future Considerations - Re-Use and Re-Purposability: The feasibility study should also address the re-purposing of this pilot into an eventual platform for ongoing experimentation and innovation. Topics to address include the following: .	Data capture mechanisms and protocols .	Data analysis tools .	Modular design .	Support for user authored games and user generated content beyond the scope of the scenario described in this document .	Support for user generated real time changes in content, i.e. injection of excursions .	Integration of 3-D graphics .	Planned support for external connections to other simulators such as High Level Architecture Real-time Platform-level Reference Federated Object Model (IEEE 1516 HLA RPR FOM) or the Distributed Interactive Simulation Protocol.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

Answer: 5-15-32419 is the BAWS Control Circuit Board Assembly and the PL5-15-32419 is the BOMs that goes with this drawing.<BR><BR>Question 7:  Regarding item number 15 on the BOM (P/N PR020000205109JR500).  Is there a suitable replacement for this part?  Answer: ITEM # 15 is available in digikey.  PLEASE NOTE THAT ITEM #15 HAS THE PART NUMBER CORRECT BUT THE DESCRIPTION HAS AN ERROR.  IT SHOULD BE 51 OHMS, NOT 51K OHMS.  ANY 51 OHMS, 2W RESISTOR AND HAS EQUIVALENT SPECS AS PR020000205109JR500  THAT WOULD FIT THE FOOTPRINT WOULD WORK.<BR><BR>Question 8: Is the wire length specified on the assembly spreadsheet located on the ASFI website (Additional documentation)in inches?  The wire length is listed in the BOM (PL5-15-32419); for example, ITEM 18 requires 18 inches of wire. The same spreadsheet makes reference to many NOTES which are not available on the documentation presented at the ASFI website. Can you direct me to where I can find these NOTES?  Answer:  If you are talking about the notes reference in the parts list(PL5-15-32419) then the notes can be found in drawing 5-15-32419.<BR><BR>Question 9:  Is there a gerber file associated with these drawings?  This will affect our bid, because it is more expensive to recreate the schematic for the PCB's without this file. Answer:  The Gerber files were uploaded with Amendment W91ZLK-10-T-0013 0001.<BR><BR>Question 10:  The drawings and bill of materials refer to notes (ex. See note 1).  Are these additional notes posted anywhere, and if not, will we be able to get them.  Answer: The notes is listed in 5-15-32419, the BOM and 5-15-32419 goes together.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is SAQMMA10M0030 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-36. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334510 with a small business size standard of 500.00 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2009-11-20 17:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Arlington , VA 22209<BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, M295 decontamination kits: The M-295 Decontamination Kit allows personnel to decontaminate individual equipment through physical removal and absorption of chemical agents. The kit consists of a pouch containing four individual wipe-down mitts enclosed in a soft protective packet. The packet is designed to fit comfortably within a pocket of the battle dress over-garment. Each mitt is comprised of a decontaminating powder contained within a nonwoven polyester material and a polyethylene film backing, which allows the powder to flow freely when in use. Decontamination is accomplished through using both the nonwoven polyester pad and the decontaminating powder., 40, EA;<BR>LI 002, M256A1 detector kits: Used to detect and identify blood, blister and nerve agents present either as liquid or as vapor. May be used to determine when it is safe to unmask, to locate and identify chemical hazards (reconnaissance), and to monitor decontamination effectiveness. The M256 is not an alarm; it is a tool used after an individual has received other warnings about the possible presence of chemical warfare agents, and have responded by putting on their chemical protective clothing., 50, EA;<BR>LI 003, M256A1 training kit:  A M256A1 trainer simulator was developed to provide realistic training while avoiding unnecessary exposure to potentially carcinogenic reagents in the M256A1 detector kit. The M256A1 trainer contains 36 pre-engineered detector tickets and an instruction booklet. The pre-engineered detector tickets show color changes comparable to those seen when the M256A1 detector kit is used in clean or contaminated environments.Agents Detected:	Hydrogen Cyanide / AC / Blood (cyanide) 	Cyanogen Chloride / CK / Blood (cyanide) 	Mustard / H / Blister 	Nitrogen Mustard / HN / Blister 	Distilled Mustard / HD / Blister 	Phosgene Oxime / CX / Blister 	Lewsite / L / Blister 	Nerve Agents / V and G / Nerve, 75, EA;<BR>LI 004, M8 paper:  The M8 paper is used to test liquid substances for the presence of nerve agents and blister agents. It is similar to the litmus (pH) paper that is found in almost any laboratory in that a test result is indicated in both types of paper by a change in color. The difference is that M8 paper is specifically designed (dye-impregnated) to react to nerve agents and blister agents in liquid form (M8 Paper is also issued to soldiers as a separate piece of chemical detection equipment). The soldier blots the M8 paper on a suspected liquid agent and observes for color change. There is a color chart inside the front cover of the booklet for comparison. The M8 paper comes in 4 x 2.5 booklets, each containing 25 sheets of detector paper., 50, EA;<BR>LI 005, Nerve Agent Vapor Detector (NAVD):  Detector is a simple, inexpensive, expendable device designed for the individual soldier to detect nerve gas vapors. The detectors can be used to quickly determine if a chemical attack detected by a gas alarm system is dangerous in the immediate vicinity of the individual or when it is safe to unmask. NAVD Nerve Agent Vapor Detector consists of: A plastic detector body containing an enzyme impregnated test paper & instruction sheet; a plastic holder containing a chemically impregnated test paper. Testing Procedure: 1. moisten the test paper in the detector body and expose it to the atmosphere. 2. Press the detector body into the holder so that the papers contact. The test paper will change color to blue or green in absence of nerve agent vapor. If nerve agent vapor is present or the test has been incorrectly performed, the color of the test paper will remain unchanged., 50, EA;<BR>LI 006, First Responder Safety Scissors:  Precision cut paramedic shears made of hardened stainless steel give unsurpassed performance under the most demanding conditions. The serrated edges of these medical scissors assist in the cutting of the toughest materials. Blunt tip protects against skin abrasions., 50, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Department of State intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.

<a href="mailto:mike.v.brown@us.army.mil">USPFO for Pennsylvania</a>
<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.  POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS MR. MICHAEL V. BROWN.  SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO:  mike.v.brown@us.army.mil. The NAICS code is 541330 Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 Million.  This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236.  This announcement is being issued on an unrestricted basis and is for the selection of Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Firms for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Contracting Officers outside of the United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania may issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Firms must be capable of concurrently responding to and working on multiple projects.  Selection of Firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  All Firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest; and FAR 36.209  Construction contracts with architect-engineer firms.  Large Firms, if selected, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS subpart 219.7 as part of any Request for Proposal package.  The subcontracting plan is NOT required with the Firms SF 330.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF SERVICES:  The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania intends to award one or more (multiple awards may be made) Firm Fixed-Price performance based Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Each A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods.  A contract minimum of $1,000 and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of each contract with no limit on individual delivery order amounts.  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contracts.  Contracting Officers outside of the USPFO for Pennsylvania will be able to issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support National Guard and other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The Government anticipates that this announcement will result in the award of up to four (4) contracts to provide services to each of four (4) primary locations:  (LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP; LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP; LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS; and LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap); in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis.  Accordingly, each contract will cover a Location, but may also result in the issuance of task orders for locations/activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  By making a submission for a Location, the submitting Firm acknowledges that task orders may be issued for other locations throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Interested Firms must indicate the Location(s) for which they are submitting.  Since proximity of a Firms office for its project team and its knowledge of the locality as it pertains to design and construction methods of military projects in the geographic area where anticipated work will be accomplished is an evaluation factor, interested Firms submitting for more than one Location must make multiple submissions with the Firms office location and key project team tailored to each Location.  The A-E IDIQ contracts that are anticipated to be awarded will each be for an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods.  Individual Delivery Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include Delivery Orders under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Delivery Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Delivery Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g).  Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION:  The Governments selection of the best value contractor(s) is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s).  Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows:  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL  meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services)  evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team.  Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team.  The key positions should include:  Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors.  Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES.  FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence  evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years)  evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules.  FACTOR 4  Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time)  evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods.  FACTOR 5  Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to one of the following:  (a) LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP, (b) LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP, (c) LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS, or (d) LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; and knowledge of the identified locality)  evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months)  in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement.  FACTOR 7  Small Business Participation  evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal.  Relative to FACTOR 5  Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office.  The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR>  <BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT:  Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.  A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each LOCATION for which the submitting Firm wants to be considered AND clearly identify the LOCATION.  Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B.  A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/.  If a submitting Firm is located outside the United States, the local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted.  Relative to all submittals, FONT SIZE shall be at least 10 pitch or larger.  Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches.  Where page limits are indicated for Parts/Sections of the SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered.  Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page.  Blank sheets or tabs separating the sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation.  The Organizational Chart required in Section D and the Matrix required as Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches.  If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location.  All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D.  Resumes in Section E shall not exceed two (2) pages each.  Multiple Resumes may be reflected on a single page.  Resumes shall be provided for the qualified professional personnel indicated in FACTOR 1, above.   Professional licenses, registrations, and/or certifications shall be specifically identified on resumes and the failure to indentify a license, registration and/or certification will result in a presumption that none exists for the individual for whom the Resume is offered.  A maximum of Ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed in Section F.  No more than one (1) page should be used for each project.  Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page.  When listing projects in Section F, an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) with multiple Task Orders as examples is not considered a project.  Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project; however, listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project.  A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project.  In Block G-26, along with the name, include the firm with which the person is associated.  Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended.  A SF 330 PART II is required for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any Subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information regarding development of Airborne High Bandwidth SATCOM system to be compatible with the Wideband Global System (WGS). This investigation includes the feasibility of using WGS satellites to transmit data to DoD teleports. This inquiry is focused solely on WGS Ka band solutions. This document was generated as a tool to summarize the requirements envisioned for the airborne SATCOM system (modem, terminal, and radome) as well as to allow the government to query commercial SATCOM terminal and antenna vendors for potential solutions. This document is not intended to be treated as a formal Statement of Work or request for proposal.  The Government is requesting information on the availability of vendors capable of performing the requirements stated herein to include cost, schedule, performance, and testing.   Technical requirements are as follows:  1. System shall be compatible with WGS Ka Band Satellite Transponders, Return Link (from the aircraft to the satellite) shall be capable of transmissions from 30.0 GHz to 31.0 GHz, Forward Link (from the satellite to the aircraft) shall be capable of receiving transmissions from 20.2 GHz to 21.2 GHz.  2.  Any proposed system shall be accompanied with measured or predicted antenna  power patterns for both transmit and receive functions.  Predicted patterns are acceptable for developmental antennas.  Measured patterns shall accompany any off-the-shelf antenna system that is proposed.  Patterns provided shall include the sidelobe mask reference line as calculated from MIL-STD-164A Section 5.1.3.1.2.  For antennas that do not have a clearly defined diameter, an equivalent diameter d = [2 x (Area/&#960;)1/2] shall be used in the sidelobe mask calculation. The antenna subsystem shall be capable of pointing its main beam 360 in azimuth. Objective Elevation Requirement:  -10 to 90. Threshold Elevation Requirement: 0 to 85. Return link and forward link shall be capable of Right Hand Circular (RHC) and Left Hand Circular (LHC) polarization modes.  Polarization of the return and forward links shall be electronically switchable while the aircraft is in flight. 3. The terminal shall be capable of transmitting data at 10 Mbps (objective) / 5 Mbps (threshold) and receiving data at 2 Mbps (objective) / 512 kbps (threshold) while at 18,000FT MSL. It is anticipated that if a solicitation is issued it will include a base effort to develop and produce two prototype radomes, an option to develop one prototype WAT system (including Radome), options for up to two EDM WAT systems, and up to seven Production WAT systems. It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 24 November 2009 to Ms. Stefanie Applegate, Contract Specialist, by electronic mail at: stefanie.applegate@navy.mil. Ms. Applegate may be reached at (732) 323-7395 or fax (732) 323-2359, or to Ms. Rayann Surel, by electronic mail at: Rayann.Surel@navy.mil, who may be reached at (732) 323-4045 or fax (732) 323-2359. Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from the RFI. Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent with costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) EAGLE II  Unrestricted
<SOLNBR>DHSEAGLE2-UNRESTRICTED
<CONTACT>Purnell Drew, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-447-5557, Fax 202-447-5550, Email purnell.drew@dhs.gov - Holly Donawa, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-447-5566, Email holly.donawa@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a significant and continued need for information technology (IT) services to support the execution of its mission. DHS has met that need principally through the use of the Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE). The original EAGLE suite of contracts was awarded to 25 large businesses (in June 2006) and 28 small businesses (in September 2006) across five (5) functional categories with a five year base period and two (2) one (1) year options. For details on the current EAGLE contract, please visit the DHS open for business website at: http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/opportunities/editorial_0700.shtm. The existing EAGLE contract serves as a department-wide platform for acquiring Information Technology (IT) service solutions in five functional categories (FCs): &bull; FC1 &ndash; Engineering Design, Development, Implementation and Integration &bull; FC2 &ndash; Operations and Maintenance &bull; FC3 &ndash; Independent Test, Evaluation, Validation and Verification &bull; FC4 &ndash; Software Development &bull; FC5 &ndash; Management Support Services In reviewing the EAGLE task orders awarded to date, DHS has observed that FC3 has rarely been used and FC5 is best leveraged when included as part of each EAGLE task order requirement. In addition, preliminary market research has indicated that the IT community&rsquo;s evolution has created an increase in the number of vendors with expertise in multiple subject areas. Further, DHS has identified several lessons learned from EAGLE, including the need to accommodate pricing strategies, which allow for adjustment over the life of the contracts, as well as the use of industry best practices, such as green invoicing and quality certifications. Potential Strategy: EAGLE II &ndash; Unrestricted will continue to be a suite of Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity services-based contracts that will enable all DHS components to acquire IT support services to accomplish their mission objectives. DHS has developed two strategy alternatives for aligning the award pool for EAGLE II unrestricted vendors. Alternative 1 maintains the current EAGLE contract Functional Categories structure, eliminates current EAGLE contract Functional Category 3-Independent Test, Evaluation, Validation and Verification, and, includes the current EAGLE contract subject area of Functional Category 5-Management Support Services into all remaining Functional Categories. The Functional Categories under Alternative 1 would be: FC1 &ndash; Engineering Design, Development, Implementation and Integration FC2 &ndash; Operations and Maintenance FC3 - Software Development Alternative 2 eliminates the use of functional categories and provides for a single award pool where all EAGLE contractors would be eligible to compete for all &ldquo;unrestricted&rdquo; EAGLE task order solicitations. Requirement: The DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) invites interested vendors to respond to this notice by completing the questions on the attached &ldquo;EAGLE II &ndash;Unrestricted Request for Information Survey Sheet.&rdquo; It is important to note that vendor responses are solely for the purpose of requesting industry feedback. The survey does not constitute any type of competition or prequalification. Responses are solely for the government&rsquo;s use in developing its strategy for EAGLE II; therefore responses will not be evaluated and the government is under no obligation to post the responses received from industry. The potential strategy alternatives should not be construed in any way as the official EAGLE II &ndash; Unrestricted strategy, nor do they commit DHS to a particular course of action or a particular timeline. This is a market research effort to gain insight into the capacity of the IT services community to meet continuing DHS IT requirements. All vendors interested in providing a response to this RFI should submit it electronically to DHSEAGLE2UNR-RFI@dhs.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on Tuesday August 11, 2009. Vendors are invited to address any subject(s)/issue(s) of interest regarding EAGLE II &ndash; Unrestricted. Efforts should be made to keep responses as BRIEF as possible and should not exceed 5 pages. Questions regarding EAGLE II-Unrestricted should be reserved for the pre-solicitation conference. The analysis of responses to this RFI will not include responses to questions nor will the Government pay for the cost of response submissions. Vendors must appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information. DHS will adhere to Federal Acquisition Regulation policy on handling proprietary information. This is not a Request for Proposal and no contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI notice. The Government reserves the right to post additional notices relative to the RFI and request capability statements and/or similar documentation. Please note that no registration is required nor is a bid list maintained.

<DESC>There is no update in the solicitation timeline.  We are still awaiting approval of the determination to award a single IDIQ contract (Section 843 D&F). We anticipate releasing the solicitation 15 days after receiving this approval under this solicitation number (M6700410R0002). I will post an update here when we receive the approval, so the solicitation timeline is now sliding day for day (i.e. today you can anticipate a solicitation around 18 Nov, tomorrow you should anticipate 19 Nov, etc. until I post the update stating that a single award is approved and start the 15 day clock).
This modification provides another link to the .zip file containing historical information on the LOGCOM website.  This link has been posted before and the .zip file does not included any new information (note that it still contains the old '09' solicitation number, no longer in use).

<DESC>VA118-10-RP-0002Charge Description Master (CDM) for Revenue Improvement and Systems Enhancements (RISE)Sources Sought Q&As #1: Is there an incumbent vendor that provides these services currently? Or is this a new requirement? There is no incumbent currently providing these services. This is a new requirement.  The VistASystem has a charge master used primarily for pricing that does not have all the features of a charge description master.  #2: In Project Overview, the document refers to "The CDM must integrate with the current VistA legacy system."  Can the VA define integrate?  The CDM solution/product must communicate with VA VistA legacy software including systems such as Integrated Billing, Laboratory, Pharmacy, and Radiology to accurately identify appropriate charges for health care claims.  The selected solution must be able to receive information from VistA legacy systems as well as send information to VistA legacy systems particularly Integrated Billing (IB).#3: In Project Overview, can VA explain this bullet: Improve billing system functionality and efficiency through the full automation of the charge capture process? VA desires to record revenue as quickly and efficiently as possible by capturing services/procedures/supplies/drugs provided at the point of care.  By linking these services to the CDM, the fees and all applicable billing data that are maintained in the CDM for each charge can be tied to the charge and transfer directly to the bill to expedite the billing process.  This should all be done automatically and not require manual creation of the charges on the bill.  #4: In Project Overview, can VA explain the need for a bi-directional interface?The charge data migrates from IB into the CDM to be priced and acquire the appropriate billing elements then the charge data returns to IB for billing.  Therefore, the CDM has to be able to send and receive data in both the interim solution and in the future.#5:  Need to better understand coding errors and rejections?  Is the VA using the CDM to generate charges for specific visits?Yes, VA will use the CDM to generate charges for all visits (whether billable or non billable) and wants to be assured that the CDM maintains current and valid coding data (CPT/HCPCS, modifiers, revenue codes, etc.) for each charge in order to reduce the possibility of errors and rejections that could occur in pre-billing or via payer denials.  VA is seeking to understand what controls and/or error messages exist in the CDM you propose to prevent invalid codes from being used in a CDM entry.#6: Page 3, Question 7.  Need to better understand the term "use of panel"?  Our RCM system performs this task in claim logic, not during charging.At VA, use of panel means the capability of using panel or explosion codes in the CDM.  It is essential that the VA have the option of building explosion codes or panels in the selected CDM product.#7: Not sure about the statement about reviews for accuracy of coding?VA wants to ensure that there is a mechanism for the CDM to be reviewed quarterly to ensure that the codes (CPT/HCPCS, MS-DRGs, modifiers, revenue, etc.) are current and accurate with the valid description and the ability for the user to apply an effective or termination date to that item in the CDM. #8: Not sure how a CDM tracks Revenue or Usage.The question reads that the CDM supports production of Revenue and Usage reports across the system for multiple sites.  Since the CDM is a repository of all services, procedures, supplies, and drugs provided at the provision of care level to a patient regardless of billing status, VA wants to record the frequency of use and associated revenue for all items listed in the CDM by department and facility.#9: Facilitate the capture of all services, procedures, supplies and drugs, regardless of billable status, in order to provide utilization data to many key systems (e.g., billing and accounts receivable, cost accounting, financial decision support).  Would this include providing charge information for non-billed services provided at the VA that is not billed through to third party insurance? Yes. #10: Provide a secure bi-directional interface with the current legacy VistA systems and future revenue system.  What is meant by bi-directional in terms of the data that would flow from the VistA system to the charge master system?  From the Charge Master to VistA?  What are the future revenue systems that are envisioned that would require interfaces?The CDM solution/product must communicate with VA VistA legacy software including systems such as IB, Laboratory, Pharmacy, and Radiology to accurately identify appropriate charges for health care claims.  The selected solution must be able to receive information from VistA legacy systems as well as send information to VistA legacy systems particularly IB.  An interface must be established with several VistA Legacy applications to capture point of care charges.  The future revenue system that would require additional interfaces is not fully defined at this time.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK1. General Intenta.	The Wilmington VA Medical Center (hereafter referred to as the WVAMC or simply as the VA) is currently experiencing severe parking problems as a result of congestion and impending construction projects.b.	The VA would like to implement a full valet parking service for Veteran patients to alleviate some of this congestion and facilitate smoother parking activity.  A variety of different methods and practices will be considered as proposed by the contractor.  c.	The Contractor will be required to assess the current VA parking situation, and take into consideration all provided government space and equipment as described herein.  The contractor will provide their proposed valet parking plan, including all processes, materials, procedures, and staffing.  d.	Upon award, the contractor will be required to implement their proposed plan and carry it out on a day-to-day basis for the duration of the contract.  The contractor will have sixty days after this contract is awarded in which to set up operations, finalize staff requirements (including Government-administered background investigations), etc.  At the end of this sixty-day period, at the latest, full operations are to begin.2. Current Estimatesa.	The VA is prepared to set aside forty to fifty standard parking spaces in a designated area for access by contractor staff for performance of services as described herein.b.	The VA estimates that there are roughly 500 unique patient visits per day. c.	Busiest times at the WVAMC are Mondays and Tuesdays.  Fridays are generally the least busy.  Weekdays are usually busiest from 8AM to 2:30 PM.3. General Contractor Requirementsa.	The contractor is required to furnish a comprehensive technical proposal detailing their suggested valet parking plan.  This plan shall include all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, and services to meet the needs of the VA.  The restrictions to this proposed plan and required elements are described herein.b.	Contract services are to be provided Monday  Friday (excluding holidays as designated herein) from 7:00 AM EST to 3:30 PM EST.  Contract staff may arrive earlier and stay later as necessary to set up or break down equipment, signage, etc.  A designated Contract Supervisor (further defined herein) shall be on-site during ANY performance under this contract.  The VA reserves the right to adjust these hours/location and other changes that are deemed necessary once the demand has been more clearly identified.c.	This contract will require mandatory background investigations designated at the Low Risk (NACI) level performed by the Government.  No employee may begin work on this contract without the successful initiation of a background investigation by the Contracting Officer.  Any employee whose background investigation yields unfavorable results is required to be removed from performance of this contract immediately.  The contractor will be charged for these background investigations if needed (contract staff already holding Government clearance need only show evidence of such), in the amount of $210 per investigation.d.	The number of lined spaces identified on the Drawings attached to this solicitation may not represent the actual number of existing lined spaces. It shall be the Contractors responsibility to visit the site to fully understand the nature of the work and the conditions under which the work shall be performed.  Failure to visit the site WILL NOT relieve the successful Offeror from providing services in strict accordance with the true intent and meaning of the specifications. During the site visit the Contractor shall obtain exact dimensions of each of the areas and determine number of spaces, which will be available at each location.  e.	Construction projects, as yet undetermined, may impact the valet parking operation during the term of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  Contractor is expected to work with VA staff to modify operations in light of these projects to continue to provide service within the guidelines of this contract.f.	Contractor may also need to work with VA staff to work around any deliveries or other traffic interruptions that may occur near the chosen entrance.g.	A walkthrough at the VA facility will be conducted.  Contractor is to contact the Contracting Officer to schedule the details of this visit.h.	The Contractor shall be responsible for protecting the personnel furnishing the services under this contract.  To carry out this responsibility, the Contractor shall provide the following for these personnel, as a minimum:  workers compensation, income tax withholding, and social security payments.  The Contractor is encouraged to hire veterans as staff, preferably veterans who receive their care at the Wilmington VA Medical Center.The parties agree that Contractor personnel shall not be considered VA employees for any purpose and shall be considered employees of the Contractor.  i.	The Contractor shall understand fully and relay to all employees performing services under this contract that any crime or other legal infraction taking place on VA property is subject to prosecution at a Federal level.  The VA Police carry jurisdiction of the enforcement of laws on VA property.  Any questions about the role of VA police or enforcement of Federal law should be brought to the Contracting Officers attention before proposals are submitted.j.	All signage content and placement shall be subject to review and approval by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) at any time.  No signage with excessively large or prominent company logos will be accepted.  Additionally, no sign may insinuate or otherwise imply that the contract staff are VA employees (i.e., no VA logos on contractors signage).k.	The contractor shall discuss the use of VA space/property throughout the negotiation process.  Contractor may use the parking attendant booth in main entrance to Building 1 or Stairwell 7 entrance west end of Bldg 1 or whatever area is designated by the VA.    Use of roped off areas in the lobby or other configurations shall be negotiated and established by mutual consent of the VA and the contractor.4.  Mandatory PracticesThe following standards are to be enforced at all times by the contractor and are considered standards of performance without needing mention in the offerors proposal:a.	The contractor shall provide valet parking to all patient vehicles, excluding those that are ineligible for valet parking or which request self-parking.  Ineligible vehicles include:	Vehicles modified to accommodate a specific disability for the driver which cannot be operated without additional training	Vehicles which lack a State inspection sticker, functional seat belt, or are otherwise unsafe to drive	Vehicles which do not have fully functioning doors, windows, or locksIf there is a dispute about whether or not a vehicle is eligible for valet parking, contractor shall contact the VA Police via the provided two-way radio to settle the dispute.b.	In the instance that a veteran patient requires special care when entering or exiting their vehicle the Contractor will contact individuals specified by VA staff to assist.c.	The contractor will greet all vehicles that approach the designated greeter pickup area, excluding busses, VA transportation vehicles, employees, vendors, or Contractors conducting business at the VA.  All greeted vehicles will be stopped by the contract employee and asked for Veteran Identification.  If necessary to an offerors proposed work processes, the veteran may be asked short follow-up questions, such as the duration of their stay or estimated time of departure.  Excessive questions or insistence upon an answer to follow-up questions will not be allowed.  d.	If the vehicle contains a first-time patient with no identification, the valet will park the patients car following their established procedure.  However, the license plate number, state, and make of the car will be recorded and submitted as part of the monthly report submitted by the Contractor as described below.e.	The patient must be provided with some form of claim check, containing at minimum a unique identification number and the current date.  This claim check must be presented to the patient BEFORE the contractor enters the patients vehicle for valet parking.f.	The contractor will remind patients BEFORE entering their vehicle that all valuables should be removed from the vehicle or stored out of sight.  g.	All valet parked vehicles will be locked completely, and all windows, doors, sunroofs, or other openings will be closed and locked.h.	All keys from valet parked vehicles will be tagged or otherwise identified with the unique identifier given to the patient on their claim check, and stored in some form of lockable container controlled by the contractor.  This container will be monitored throughout the workday by contractor staff, and shall never be left unlocked and unattended.  If direct sight lines with this container are broken during performance by the contractor, the container shall be locked until their return.i.	Returned cars will be delivered to the patients with the engine running, positioned for easy entry within a reasonable (within three car widths) distance to the hospital entrance.  The contractor will not leave idling returned vehicles unattended, and will ensure that only the patient who has provided the claim check is allowed entry into the drivers seat of the vehicle.  The contractor will not block exit traffic from the hospitals main entrance for self-parked vehicles or patients, and shall adjust the placement of returned vehicles as necessary to facilitate smooth operations.   j.	The VA will provide walkie-talkie radios keyed into the Hospital Operations channel at the WVAMC.  The contractor shall negotiate the exact number of radios and who should have access to them with the COTR at the time of award.

Aside from the functions listed and any other oversight duties, the VA will not mandate specific valet parking workload for this supervisor.  THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT FOR CONTRACT OVERSIGHT, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND ANY OTHER INTERACTION WITH THE COTR WILL BE THE SUPERVISOR.  THE SUPERVISOR MUST BE ON-SITE, IN PERSON, EVERY DAY THAT SERVICES ARE PERFORMED UNDER THIS CONTRACT.  In the event that the Supervisor will be absent from work, the COTR will be notified and a designee will be named by the contractor who will perform these duties.

Uniform styles will be approved by the COTR before performance on this contract begins.  Uniforms must always be cleaned, pressed, and neat and professional in appearance.  The COTR will provide the final authority over any disagreements regarding uniforms or physical appearance of contract staff.y.	Because Government-initiated background investigations are mandated under this contract, the contractor shall have an adequate pool of available employees  either working or potential  that have completed NACI-level background investigations.  Lead time for background investigations will NOT be an adequate excuse for failure to meet performance standards or established staffing levels  INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL STAFF, ON SITE OR OFF, WHO MAY BE DESIGNATED SUPERVISOR.z.	On a monthly basis, a meeting will be held at which the Contract Supervisor will provide a typewritten report for the COTR giving a complete summary of the month worked.  This report will be on company letterhead, and will provide a signature from the Supervisor confirming the accuracy of the report as presented to the best of his/her knowledge.  The date of the monthly meetings will be mutually scheduled by the COTR and Contract Supervisor, and will at the latest take place within the last week of the calendar month.  At any time, the COTR or VA Chief of Police may request a current report or any component thereof within one business week.  The report will include, at a minimum:	A breakdown of each employee who performed work under this contract for the month, with dates, times, etc. tracked.  Total monthly hours for each employee should be tabulated.	A full report of any personnel incidents during the month.

Additionally, contract staff shall be equipped with umbrellas that will be used to shield customers from precipitation during periods of inclement weather.  Contract staff shall escort customers to their idling vehicles under these umbrellas when deemed appropriate, when indicated by the COTR, or by request of the customer.  Snow brushes shall be provided by the contractor.  In severe weather conditions, the COTR may order contract operations ceased for the day for safety purposes.bb.	At his sole discretion, the COTR may elect to suspend or cancel valet operations due to inclement weather or other factors.  If this cancellation is known of beforehand, the Contractors supervisory employee will be given at least one days advance notice.  A pro-rated portion of payment for the month will be deducted for any time without valet operations.  In the event that services are cancelled or suspended due to inclement weather without prior notice, contract staff are to stay on-site throughout their normally scheduled hours, and shall resume operations if instructed to do so.  Payment will still be rendered in full for these cancellations without prior notice.cc.	Contractor staff must be able to handle all normal transmission types, read all standard speedometers, and operate all of the aspects of commercially available vehicles.dd.

At the beginning of each new day of performance, the Contract Supervisor may pick up any remaining keys from the VA Police Station, and will allow retrieval following standard procedures.  When keys are dropped off to the VA Police, the contractor will submit a chain of custody form (provided by contractor) that includes the number of keys being dropped off and the associated valet ID numbers.  gg.	Though the contractor is free to park vehicles as per their approved technical proposal during hours of contract performance, all vehicles left at the end of the day with keys turned over to the VA Police/AOD for overnight storage shall be returned to a standard parking configuration within the line striping in the parking lot.  The COTR may ask the contractor to move the remaining cars to an area closer to the main building so that patients will have easy access to their cars.  No double-parking, parking outside of striped areas, or other congestion of patient vehicles shall be left overnight and/or for patient recovery.  Designated parking spots will be determined for long term veteran patients and those keys must be left with VA Police.hh.

IntroductionThe contractor is expected to perform with the utmost attention to customer service at all times.  Consideration should be given to the mission of the VA and the status and composition of its patients and clients.  Contractor is expected to act as part of a team of linked disciplines and departments whose goal is to work together in providing compassionate care and service to Veterans, their dependents, and their families.The VA reserves the right to dismiss any contractor staff at any time for a portion of the day, for a set period of time, or permanently.  Additionally, the VA reserves the right to demand the replacement of the contractors supervisory employee.  The VA will not need to give any advance notice of this dismissal or a reason.  Disciplinary action will usually consist of a written warning and request for a corrective action plan to assure the problem does not occur in the future.  More than one written warning concerning the same issue may lead to cure or show cause notices, and ultimately the termination of this contract for cause.  All disciplinary correspondence will be retained in the contract file and will be taken into consideration in the renewal of option years or as past performance for any future contract for which the contractor submits an offer.2.  General Performance Standardsa.	Courtesy and respect must be offered to anyone the contract staff comes into contact with during performance of their duties.  Abuse of any nature in any circumstance by Contractor staff will lead to disciplinary action.b.	No patient shall wait longer than 15 minutes to have their vehicle valet parked or retrieved at any time during performance of this contract.  This shall include periods of inclement weather when the COTR has not allowed the Contractor to cease operations.  The fifteen-minute period begins for parking as soon as the vehicle queues itself into the Valet staging area, and performance is complete when the vehicle has been processed and driven out of the queue area by the contractor.  The fifteen minute retrieval period begins as soon as the patient queues themselves into the retrieval line, and is complete as soon as the patient is presented their idling vehicle.  Any unfavorable deviations from this guideline shall constitute a failure of this standard.  The CO and/or COTR reserve the right to excuse delays of 15 minutes or more due to circumstances beyond the contractors control.  This will be a subjective determination which may not be appealed.c.	No tips are to be accepted, of any kind.  Acceptance of tips - monetary or otherwise - by contract staff will result in an automatic failure of this standard and disciplinary action.  The contractor staff will also be required to relinquish the tip.d.	Adherence to all contract clauses and provisions as detailed herein is mandated at all times.
