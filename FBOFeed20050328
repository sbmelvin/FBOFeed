<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Nevada Test Site (NTS) Contractor, Bechtel Nevada, is requesting Statement of Qualifications from interested parties for a project to provide complete design, fabrication, and installation (design/build) of a water storage tank facility.  The installation will be located at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), Nye County, on Federal land controlled by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The Site is located about 85 miles North of Las Vegas, NV.  

The job site at the NTS is within a NNSA/NSO security area.  SUBCONTRACTOR’S employees may be required to obtain security badges and vehicle passes, depending on specific circumstances.  Such badges/passes shall be issued at no charge to the SUBCONTRACTOR.  No SUBCONTRACTOR employee or representative will be admitted to the site unless he/she is a citizen of the United States in the final decree and at least 18 years of age.

The potable water system will consist of a 10,000 gallon potable water storage tank, complete with water meter, fill valve/level controls, a pump house and interconnection (yard) piping.  The pump house will contain two potable water pumps, with controls, surge tank, one fire water tank topping off pump with on/off control, two backflow preventers, internal sprinkler system, air conditioning/ventilation and all electrical wiring.  General design criteria for the potable water system are the Nevada Administrative Code 445A “Water Controls”, AWWA D100 and the International Building Code.

The fire water service system will consist of a 200,000 gallon water storage tank, fire water pump house, and interconnection fire water piping.  The fire water pump house will house an electric fire pump with diesel fire water pump backup pump and a jockey pump.  The fire water pump house will be furnished complete with all controls, air conditioning and ventilation.  The general design criteria for the fire water tank is NFPA 22, “Standard for Water Tanks for Private Fire Protection”  and for the pumps, NFPA 20, Standard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection and the International Building Code 2003. The requirements of DOE O 420.1, Section 4.1, are applicable to the design and construction of the fire water service system to assure adequate protection of the public, workers, and the environment from nuclear hazards.  The fire water pumps, controllers and tank systems shall be UL listed and FM approved.

The potable water storage tank, potable water pump house and fire water pump house are desired to be fabricated off-site and delivered to the site for installation.

The fire water system, including support systems required to perform the intended safety function, are designated as “Safety Significant” and must be designed to meet Performance Category (PC) = 2 criteria as defined in DOE-STD-1020.  PC-2 criteria are similar to essential emergency facilities such as police and fire stations.  Also, the standard requires increased material accountability (traceable), increased fabrication and construction inspection, and seismic design safety factors.   The SUBCONTRACTOR must be able to demonstrate the adequacy of the design and fabrication of the fire water system to meet these criteria.

The SUBCONTRACTOR must have in place a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP).  The QAP must be implemented by the successful SUBCONTRACTOR.  Bechtel Nevada will perform an assessment on the SUBCONTRACTORS implementation of this QAP.  The QAP must address the following management, performance, and assessment criteria in accordance with 10 CFR 830.122:

Criterion 6 -- Performance/Design.
Criterion 7 -- Performance/Procurement.
Criterion 8 -- Performance/Inspection and Acceptance Testing.
Criterion 9 -- Assessment/Management Assessment. 
Criterion 10 -- Assessment/Independent Assessment.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the lab’s knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of automated COMINT collection and processing.  Solutions to basic research and engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought.  The overall technical objectives of the BAA are to develop techniques and algorithms for the detection, recognition, exploitation, and location of analog and digital communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. We are interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation; (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved digital signal processing hardware and software. The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Signal detection (2) Signal recognition and classification in low Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) environments (3) Improved methods to accomplish geolocation (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD) algorithms (5) Interference cancellation (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked) (9) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms.  Detailed scope and definition of problems follow here: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, geolocation in moderate to low SINR environments: Current SIGINT platforms are inundated with multiple signals of interest across the spectrum, but are not able to process all of the high priority signals for a host of reasons including dense signal environments, low power signals, low SINR, power control, etc. (2) Any technologies that will enable current systems greater ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and locate signals would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation:  Technology to further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is another area of research covered by this BAA.  Particular attention will be paid to technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters beneath interference.  (4) Multi-User Detection: Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired.  Specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms are also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamformed, digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antenna are desired. (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques for improved geolocation for moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable is desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: We are interested in developing the above capabilities for existing and emerging military and commercial radio communications. (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked): We are interested in techniques for second, third and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (9) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Attention to DSP requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest.  (10) Modify and augment existing fielded SIGINT systems, and aid in the development of research capabilities that can be inserted into open architecture systems. Use simulation and modeling to analyze and assess technical performance of signal processing algorithms and techniques.  (11)  Support assessment, selection, and refinement of algorithms by evaluating different classes of algorithms and specific algorithm designs.   The contractor will work with Government organizations and other contractors to identify and acquire algorithms of interest, and provide technical, implementation and benefit assessments.  (12)  Participate in system planning activities for airborne SIGINT systems, including assessment of operational requirements, mission and threat analysis, threat signal characterization, and analysis of system operations.  (13)  Provide planning information to help anticipate new threat systems and enabling technologies and techniques; perform systems engineering of advanced SIGINT concepts and systems; develop and transition key algorithms and processing techniques; assist in collection, processing, and interpretation of test data; and evaluate alternative approaches and algorithms to assess their advantages and deficiencies.  (14)  Monitor developments that influence the character and priority of different potential SIGINT targets, trends in architecture and operations of SIGINT systems, and algorithms and implementation technologies for SIGINT processing.  Based on this information, the contractor will provide inputs to AFRL/IFEC to shape ongoing activities that best accommodate projected threat characteristics, develop capabilities that integrate with other SIGINT and sensor systems, and apply relevant and useful techniques and technologies in SIGINT processing.  Coordinate with organizations, users, platforms, and developers throughout the SIGINT community.  (15)  Assist in the development of capabilities that can be integrated with SIGINT and sensor systems. (16)  Work with AFRL/IFEC in planning, equipping, conducting, interpreting, and achieving field collections of relevant data.  Ensure that field collections obtain technically valid and operationally relevant data, in characterizing the collected data, and in documenting and formatting the data to support its use across the SIGINT community.  (17)  Participate in field testing and flight testing in order to accomplish data collection.   (18)  Be responsible for the development of the AFRL Blue Mountain collection and analysis in-house system. Support AFRL in-house research through data collections, integration and test of AFRL developed algorithms and techniques, development planning, acquisition support, and specialty engineering.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation  (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the Rome Research Site mission and the extent to which the proposed effort will contribute to balancing the overall research and development program of AFRL (3)  Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; as well as the qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives and the offeror’s record of past and present performance. (4) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (5) the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.  

Government-furnished information and Government-furnished property may be furnished for use in performance of individual tasks. 

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror’s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<RESPDATE>051507
<ARCHDATE>07142007
<CONTACT>Nicole Meenen, 256-955-1254
<DESC>This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA ar e considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. USASMDC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those areas covered in Part I of this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Funding of research within USASMDC areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the USASMDC technical point of con tact, identified below, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to submission of a concept paper or proposal.  The recommended four-step sequence is an initial contact, summary concept paper, proposal and contract award for selected projects.  This se quence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. This BAA consists of four parts as follows:     	Part I      -    Research Interests Part II     -    Proposal Preparation and Submission Part III    -    Proposal Evaluation Part IV    -    Proposal Forms THOSE SUBMITTING PROPOSALS ARE CAUTIONED THAT ONLY A CONTRACTING OFFICER CAN OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ANY AGREEMENT INVOLVING EXPENDITURE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS. This BAA shall  remain in effect until May 15, 2007 or until superseded. USASMDC points of contact: The USASDMC technical POC for this BAA is Mr. Richard Runyan who may be reached by email, Richard.Runyan@smdc.army.mil.   The contracts POC is Ms. Nicole Meenen who may be reached at (256) 955-1254 or e-mail:  nicole.meenen@smdc.army.mil.	 	In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation.  From this summary conc ept paper the government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Kinetic Energy Interceptor Directorate and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed.   The government, at its option, may provide comme nts that might be of assistance to the offeror in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal.  Offerors are not required to submit concept papers nor are they precluded by the governments advice on a concept paper from submitting a formal proposa l. Summary concept papers will be accepted from the 1st to the 15th of each month. They should be sent to:              US Army Space and Missile Defense Command             ATTN:  SMDC-CM-AK/Nicole Meenen 	P.O. Box 1500 	Huntsville, AL  35807-3801 	Email address: nicole.meenen@smdc.army.mil   (preferred method of receipt) The Kinetic Energy Interceptor Directorate will review the concept paper and the contracting officer  respond to the offeror by email not more than 20 days after receipt of the concept paper.  The summary concept paper should, in summary, capture the propo sed technical concept together with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, and its contribution to the USASMDC.  Also included should be a period of performance and anticipated cost. The concept paper is normally limited to 2 page s (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary.  Please include a POCs email address on the concept paper.  A review of concept papers by USASMDC engineers will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposa l.  If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested.  All proposals, written communications, or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the mailing address as above.   Proposals submitted in response to this BAA may be for a period of performance up to 48 months. Such long-term proposals should contain a brief summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire fou r year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor category. Include cost data for each task. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $2.5M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 18 months.  In addi tion  to the basic contract, contract options can be proposed.  The total  period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 4 years.  This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report.  Any awards resulting fro m this announcement are subject to the availability of funds in FY04 and succeeding years.  PART I RESEARCH INTERESTS 	The Kinetic Energy Interceptor Directorate is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors capable of satisfying the Governments needs on research to advance its capability in missile defense interceptor technologies. Proposals with new or unique ideas which enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge are solicited.  Proposals should address the technical areas listed below:  KINETIC ENERGY INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES 		A. Seekers 		B. Guidance, Navigation, and Control 		C. Propulsion and Divert & Attitude Control Systems (DACS)                         D.  Avionics 		E. Windows and Structures 		F. Innovative Algorithm Concepts  		        Applicable to Interceptors  		G. Other Applicable Interceptor Technologies PART II PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION Part II - PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION Part II is intended to provide information needed in preparing research proposals for submission to USASMDC. Both prospective principal investigators and business office personnel will find it useful. Most of the information needed by the personnel preparing the proposal will be found in Section 2 of this part.  Blank proposal forms, included in Part IV of this BAA, are designed to provide all required information needed for contracting purposes. Use of  the proposal forms will expedite award of the research contract. Organizations or individuals interested in submitting research proposals to USASDMC should make preliminary inquiries on the general need for the type of research effort contemplated before expending extensive time and effort in preparing a detailed resear ch proposal. A formal proposal should present the proposed research effort in sufficient detail to allow USASMDC to evaluate the scientific merit and relevance of the proposed research. There is no page limit on formal proposals. USASMDC encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, historically black colleges and universities, minority institutions, small business, and small disadvantaged business concerns to submit research proposals for consideration. 1. GENERAL INFORMATION 	It is requested that no classified data be included in proposals or concept papers. SET ASIDE TOPICS 	The topic Innovative Algorithm Concepts applicable to Interceptors, has been set aside for small business and Historically Black College/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI).  The same evaluation criteria as stated in this announcement will be used to select offers under the set-aside and non set-aside portions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code  is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees (only applicable to small businesses submitting summary concept papers/proposals under the small business set-aside portion of the BAA). If no acceptable small business or HBCU/MI proposals are received during an evaluation period, the set-aside will be automatically dissolved and contract awards may be made without regard to size status. ELIGIBILITY To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, ability to comply with the performance schedule, prior record of performance, integrity, organization, experience, opera tional controls, technical skills, facilities, and equipment.

If none, so state. (4) If the offeror is proposing to perform research in a classified area, indicate the level of classification of the research and the level of clearance of the potential principal investigator and all other proposed personnel.  Also indicate the Governmen t agency that issued the clearances. (5) A completed Representations and Certifications form (see Part IV). (6)  (Applicable to large businesses only)  If the total amount of the proposal exceeds $500,000, a statement that you agree to prepare and submit a subcontracting plan for small business and small disadvantaged business concerns is required should your pr oposal be selected for negotiation. A mutually agreeable plan will be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The contract cannot be executed unless the contracting officer determines that the plan provides the maximum practicable opportunit y for small business and small disadvantaged business concerns to participate in the performance of the contract. Should your plan be determined acceptable and should you fail to comply with the terms of the plan, this noncompliance will be considered to b e a material breach of the contract.             (7)  (Subcontracting)  Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rende ring services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy.  Subcontracting goals for small and small disadvantaged businesses (including historically black  colleges and universities/minority institutions) are 23 and 5 percent, respectively.  Subcontracting goals for women-owned business is 5%, HUBZone is 1 1/2%, and Veteran Owned and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business is 1%.

<CONTACT>Karen Gamble, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-3366, Fax 301-827-7101, Email karen.gamble@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) to award a contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP).

CDRH intends to contract with NCRP to assist in conducting an international workshop.  This workshop will address research needs and gaps in knowledge of biological effect and adverse health outcomes of exposure to radio frequency energy such as those emitted from wireless communication devices.  In order to avoid unnecessary duplication and in recognition of the international nature of the scientific community and of the wireless industry, the workshop will consider the scientific literature and ongoing research from an international perspective.

NCRP will work with CDRH staff to perform the following:  1) establish an organizing committee consisting of technical experts from government, industry and academia, 2) contact workshop speakers, develop a Program Book, and prepare all administrative correspondence for the workshop, including travel arrangements and reimbursement, 3) arrange hotel accommodations for the speakers, 4) arrange for a conference facility and support staff at the registration desk, 5) collect papers from the workshop participants and prepare brief proceedings of the workshop, and 6) Provide CDRH with a report on current gaps in knowledge and types of research needed to address those gaps based on recommendations from workshop participants. 

CDRH has a CRADA agreement with CTIA, and the proposed work represents the third component of the CRADA agreement.  The FDA is unaware of any other institution of similar scientific stature being able to meet the requirements of the work described above.  
NCRP publishes scientific reports on a regular basis and has a history of publishing reports in the area of radiofrequency bioeffects.  The NCRP was chartered by Congress in 1964 and has significant unique experience with public meetings, conferences and published reports concerning various aspects of radiation protection.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with NCRP as the only source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ). Sources interested in this requirement must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received at karen.gamble@fda.gov within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
				2100 Second Street, SW
				Washington, D.C. 20593
				Telephone:   (202) 267-2285

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-04-R-6F9007 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN): CLIN 0001 Propane refueling-Two sites; Total Quantity 3,400 gallons.  The locations are: 1) Naked Island, 2,300 gallons; 2) Point Pigot, 1,100 gallons.  CLIN 0002 Propane refueling-Seven sites; Total Quantity 6,800 gallons. The locations are: 1) Robert Barron, 2,200 gallons; 2) Duke Island, 800 gallons; 3) Sukkwan Island, 800 gallons; 4) Cape Fanshaw, 700 gallons; 5) Zarembo Island, 700 gallons; 6) Mt. Mac Arther, 700 gallons; 7) Althorp Peak, 900 gallons.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The Contractor shall re-fuel two Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Valdez area and seven Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Juneau area.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the permanent site-standard (five) 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.
START OF WORK:  Work shall not start before 1 August 2004.
DELIVERY: Services shall be completed for all sites, except Robert Barron, not later than 30 September 2004.  The Robert Barron site shall be refueled no later than 30 August 2004.

<DESC>Statement of Work Quality Assurance Technical Support  I. Purpose  The Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology  Innovation (OSRTI) requires environmental data of known quality and of a level of quality sufficient to  support decision-making and enforcement under the mandates of the Superfund Amendments and  Reauthorization Act (SARA), commonly referred to as ?Superfund.? These environmental data are  developed through analytical services performed on environmental samples taken from Superfund  hazardous waste sites. The majority of analytical services are currently provided through the EPA  Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), although local, State, Federal and other government agencies may  also request analytical services. These analytical services submitted by other government agencies in  support of the Superfund Program and the CLP are administered through the EPA by OSRTI?s Analytical  Services Branch (ASB). The CLP is a network of commercial laboratories working under fixed-price  contracts with the EPA to perform routine sample analyses using standardized analytical methods, quality  assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures, and data reporting formats.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide technical support that assures the development of  environmental data which are of sufficient quality to meet the technical and analytical needs of OSRTI and  Superfund. This contract will provide Quality Assurance Technical Support (QATS).

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration on Aging (AOA), Office of Administrative Services (OAS), through the Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to award, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, a sole source contract to Mr. David Dunlap of Falls Church, Virginia, to provide Human Capital and Workforce Analysis support services.  The goal of this acquisition is to provide technical consultation and assistance to OAS Human Resource staff to prepare and implement the AoA Human Capital Strategic Plan, processes development, report writing for human capital issues required by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), to develop technical data and establish automated data tracking mechanisms for capturing workforce data trends and to forecast workforce requirements.  This contract is for a base year and two one (1) year options – not to exceed 1248 hours per year.  Each of the required tasks stated in this announcement requires direct experience in the areas of Human Capital Management, Workforce Analysis and Planning, Employee Development, and development of automated Human Resource Reporting Systems that will assist AoA in the Human Capital program development of management controls and best practices.  Stated below are the four qualifications required in the statement of work.  1. Expert knowledge of the program activities of the Human Capital and Workforce Planning of the Operating Divisions of the DHHS with particular emphasis on the Human Resources operations of DHHS; 2. Expert knowledge of the operating procedures of DHHS with particular emphasis on the Department’s requirement to meet the President’s Management Agenda as related to Human Capital; 3. Proficient understanding of the Department’s program management strategies as they relate to major workforce analysis and planning, forecasting staff requirements and conducting studies to include analysis of employment trends and issues; 4. Expert understanding of the most recent revisions to the President’s Management Agenda and program management in the Federal Government to include the Human Capital initiatives, employee development and various personnel program and initiatives.
As a national expert on HHS Human Capital initiatives with over 30 years experience dealing with all facets of Department of Health and Human Services human resource activities, including those of the Administration on Aging and its other Operating Divisions, Mr. Dunlap alone has the unique qualifications and expertise that would allow the project to be completed in a timely fashion and with information relevant to government policymaking.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any other vendor but David Dunlap would result in a significant delay and increase in cost.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by 2:00 pm EST, April 15, 2005.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Contractors may forward capability statements to the referenced address within 15 business days after the date of publication of this Notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For further information, contact Paula Conner in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-2475.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>It is the intent of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), P.O. Box 3504, Sunnyvale, California  94088-3504 for development of Block 08 Enhancement Capab ility Development for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) System. This Block 08 development effort is the next step in the evolutionary Block Capability approach for the THAAD system.  THAAD is an Element of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Bal listic Missile Defense System (BMDS) which provides terminal defense against ballistic missiles.  It provides broad coverage against threats to military forces and to critical and strategic assets, such as population centers and industrial resources.  This  proposed acquisition is for the Block 08 Enhancement Capability Development effort which places significant emphasis on adding new capabilities that are compatible with the existing THAAD element today.  The added capabilities include remote operation of THAAD launchers beyond Line-of-Sight, launching THAAD missiles based on information from non THAAD sensors, reporting of non-threatening ballistic missiles to the BMDS, and compliance with hardware and software development requirements of the Department of  Defense (DoD) Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR).  The proposed acquisition is directed to LMSSC pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy ag ency requirements.  LMSSC has been the prime contractor on two previous THAAD System developmental efforts under Contract DASG60-92-C-0101 ($1.4B+) and DASG60-00-C-0072 ($4B+).  Contract DASG60-00-C-0072 will continue through FY 09, and the work under this  proposed Block 08 Development contract must be completely compatible and fully integrated with the work under that contract.  Only LMSSC is capable of performing this Block 08 Development work and successfully integrating it with prior and on-going develo pment work on the THAAD System.  A CPAF contract for a 42-month period of performance is anticipated for this Block 08 Development effort.  The proposed contract will encourage competitive subcontracting and subcontracting with Small Business, Small Disadv antaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses including Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Historically Underutilized Business Zone firms.  Recommend anyone from these type businesses interested in subcon tracting opportunities contact LMSSC, Mr. Dick Baker (408) 742-9050.  This acquisition is open to foreign competition at the subcontract level.  Point of contact is U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN:  SMDC-CM-CT/Cathy H. Hill.  See Note 22 .

<DESC>The ad previously posted on March 25, 2005, inadvertently posted counties in Indiana and not Michigan.  This modified ad is listed in its entirety with the correct zips and counties for State of Michigan, Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3.
The United States Postal Service (USPS), Great Lakes Facilities Service Office (GLFSO), is seeking interest from General Contractors to prequalify for one or more Indefinite Quantity Construction Contracts (IQCC)/Job Order Contracts (JOC) for repair and alteration projects within the State of Michigan which include:  See below Areas and Counties. The term of the contract will be for one year, with four possible one-year renewal options.  The maximum aggregate amount under the contracts will not exceed $9.5 million dollars.  The contract renewal option may be exercised at the discretion of the USPS Contracting Officer.  The minimum work ordered during the contract period, including any renewal options, will not be less than $10,000.

A JOC is an indefinite quantity construction contract pursuant to which the contractor will perform a series of individual projects at different Postal Service facilities.  Prequalified contractors will propose a Contract Multiplier and Premium Time Multiplier to be applied to a Unit Price Schedule.  Contractor agrees that the Contractor Multiplier and/or the Premium Time Multiplier under this contract, when used in determining the total amount of the work order, includes all profit, overhead, bonds, insurance and other contingencies, over and above the direct costs of construction.  Regular working hours are between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.  Work ordered during premium time, as directed by a specific detailed scope of work, will be paid at the contracted Premium Time Multiplier.  The multiplier submitted by the offeror must not be more than four decimal places (e.g. 1.2222 or 0.9700).  This multiplier will apply to each unit price in the Unit Price Schedule.

General Contractors must meet the following minimum requirements to apply:  (1) your firm must have an office located within the State of Michigan and must be willing and able to perform work on all projects that may occur within any of the geographical areas.  If the office is NOT the main or home office for the company, contractor must furnish the address of the office and the phone number.  Contractor must submit a staffing chart and describe the duties and experience of the employees for that office.  If the contractor does not have an office located within the preferred area, the contractor must furnish information on how the company will administer the contract from their office outside of the preferred.  (2) You are expected to possess and provide a copy of a valid contractor’s license(s) for the areas specified, or provide a copy of the application to obtain such license(s) in the state(s) listed in the geographical area; (2) your firm must provide proof of bonding with a minimum aggregate dollar amount of $2,500,000; (3) your firm must have been in business, under the firm’s present name, for a minimum of five (5) consecutive years.

Contractors will be evaluated on the information provided in the Contractor Qualification Statement which includes financial capability, experience, and safety.  You must provide the required financial information stated in the prequalification package.  The Contractor’s Qualification Statements will be evaluated by a U.S.P.S. Committee, and only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  Minority-owned and Women-owned Business participation is encouraged.

Contractor Qualification Statement packages are available free of charge and may be obtained by written request to Debra Schmaus, USPS, GLFSO, 62 Stratford Drive, Bloomingdale, IL  60117-7000 or by email, debra.schmaus@usps.gov.  Ms. Schmaus’ telephone number is (630) 295-6237.  Provide your email address and the qualification statement will be sent to you electronically.

You are expected to complete the Contractor Qualification Statement in its entirety.  Incomplete submittals may result in non-prequalification.  Submittals will not be returned.  Only those applicants submitting a Contractor Qualification Statement package will be evaluated.  Applicants will be advised within 180 calendar days, after the closing of this Contractor Qualification Statement as to prequalification status.

For information, contact Teri Wilcox, Facilities Contract Specialist, USPS - GLFSO, (630) 295-6274, (630) 295-6262 fax, email: teri.wilcox@usps.gov.  This is not a Request for Proposal.

This is for the same project as synopsis FA4897-05-R-0013 (dated 11 Jan 05) and was created to save valuable posting time waiting for FA4897-05-R-0013 to be un-archived to make a modification incorporating the correct NAICS code.

Now that the original synopsis, FA4897-05-R-0013 is un-archived, synopsis F3F1S15063A100 will be canceled. All information included in that synopsis will be incorporated in the original synopsis FA4897-05-R0013 via this modification.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

This RFP synopsis is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Air Handling System Improvements IMO23990 at Federal Building No. 2, Bannister Complex, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, 64131, Solicitation Number GS06P05GZC0011.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents prepared by an architect/engineer through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000.  The contract length shall be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Government, but shall not exceed 24 months 730 calendar days after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about September 16, 2005.  This procurement will be completed using a two-step source selection process. This contract is restricted only to those firms having an existing design, construction and/or design/build contracting office within the bi-state Kansas City region defined by the Mid-America Regional Council MARC as the Kansas counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray. Such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this announcement.   Federal Building No. 2 of the Bannister Complex, which was built in 1942, has 197,410 usable square feet of office space. It consists of a basement and two levels above ground and has approximately 1,535 employees. The fan houses and air distribution equipment were added to the building around 1960.  The HVAC system consists of air handling units in fan houses located on the roof that distribute air to a major portion of the building, plus packaged air handling units that serve spaces with special needs and/or spaces mostly in the basement that were lacking in airflow from the fan house system.  The existing overall HVAC system is not energy efficient due to the use of old, inefficient equipment and the use of smaller, low efficiency, packaged units.  The existing fan house systems are in need of repair and renovation.  The supply and return fans and motors for the fan house air handling units are inefficient and inadequate in capacity to meet the airflow and static pressure requirements of the system.  The existing configuration of supply air ducts does not provide good air distribution to the entire building since not enough air velocity is maintained to force the air to the end of the system.  The scope of work includes the following: 1. Installation of five 5 new roof-top variable air volume, direct digital control, air-handling units to replace existing units. System should be equipped with a fixed supply-air temperature.  2. Removal of all penthouse fan equipment and modification of ductwork to accommodate new roof-mounted packaged air handling equipment. 3. Sealing of all chase penetrations and openings; relocating any obstructions to airflow in the chases; installing fire dampers and access panels; installing fire-rated enclosures; and replacing control valves, steam traps, strainers and roll filter media in the fan house units. Addition of medium-pressure ductwork in existing vertical chases. 4. Replacement of all existing horizontal supply ductwork on the roof with new ductwork. 5. Provision of outside air to existing packaged units located throughout the building. 6. Relocation of existing ground level air intakes to the roof. 7. Removal of existing air handling units in basement and on first floor and connection of areas served to building distribution system.  8. Replacement of outdoor air damper and actuator.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed after regular business hours.  The request for proposals RFP solicitation will be issued on or about April 12, 2005.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS.  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch 6PCA, will no longer mail hardcopies of the solicitation and amendments.  The solicitation specifications and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR www.ccr.gov and then with FEDTeDS www.fedteds.gov.  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry www.fedbizopps.gov but the sensitive but unclassified acquisitions related information specifications will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about April 28, 2005 at the GSA Office, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri.  GSA will receive proposals on or about May 12, 2005.  Date and time will be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal will be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will use the tradeoff process method of evaluation in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating technical factors and price, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage One will be technical evaluations of proposals to establish those who are most technically qualified.  Stage Two will be receipt of pricing and scheduling. Stage One technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in descending order of importance:  1. Past performance of the firm; 2. Experience and qualifications of key personnel; 3. Management plan; and 4. Team composition, organization and prior experience as a design-build team.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the best value, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 39% total for Small Business SB, which includes 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business SDB; 5% for Woman-Owned Small Business WOSB, 3% for Hub Zone Small Business; HZSB; 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business VOSB; and 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business SDVOSB.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Mike Flanigan, Contract Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4912 or fax him at 816-926-3517.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Jean Dodd, at 816-926-1174.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the notice below is to re-release tech data package on FedTeDS.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
				2100 Second Street, SW
				Washington, D.C. 20593
				Telephone:   (202) 267-2285

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-04-R-6F9007 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN): CLIN 0001 Propane refueling-Two sites; Total Quantity 3,400 gallons.  The locations are: 1) Naked Island, 2,300 gallons; 2) Point Pigot, 1,100 gallons.  CLIN 0002 Propane refueling-Seven sites; Total Quantity 6,800 gallons. The locations are: 1) Robert Barron, 2,200 gallons; 2) Duke Island, 800 gallons; 3) Sukkwan Island, 800 gallons; 4) Cape Fanshaw, 700 gallons; 5) Zarembo Island, 700 gallons; 6) Mt. Mac Arther, 700 gallons; 7) Althorp Peak, 900 gallons.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The Contractor shall re-fuel two Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Valdez area and seven Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Juneau area.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the permanent site-standard (five) 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.
START OF WORK:  Work shall not start before 1 August 2004.
DELIVERY: Services shall be completed for all sites, except Robert Barron, not later than 30 September 2004.  The Robert Barron site shall be refueled no later than 30 August 2004. 
AWARD:  This purchase will be based on the following criteria:  Past performance and technical capability will be evaluated.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
CLAUSES:  The following FAR provisions apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offers Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representatives and Certifications and Certifications Commercial Items, all offerors are to include with their offer a completed copy of the Representatives and Certifications.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (formerly STRICOM). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-B. Distributed Simulation Environments and Interoperability”.  Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Ms. Sandy Veautour, PEO STRI, (407)384-3665, sandy.veautour@peostri.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. OBJECTIVE: Develop an initial open virtual simulation architecture (VSA) framework.  This VSA will be used by virtual simulation systems to facilitate interoperability and integration in current simulations and be the foundation on which all future virtual simulations will be constructed.  The VSA will be a foundation component of the Simulation Environment Core (SE Core) product line within the virtual domain and provide for interoperability with the Army’s Live Virtual Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) and the Future Combat System (FCS). The framework will be used to support the development of virtual training systems across air, ground, and special operations requirements.  Additionally it will be used across individual, crew, collective, combined arms, mission rehearsal training missions. 

A phased approach to this effort is sought.  White papers should address a basic award (Phase 1) and one priced option (Phase 2) as stated below. 

PHASE 1.  The phase 1 effort will consist of research and development of an initial open VSA including all the of the development artifacts necessary to build a product line framework (i.e.: domain analysis, product line allocation, uses cases, etc.).  The VSA should be crafted using a product line framework with automated tools to allow viewing of the development artifacts for the architecture.  It is desired that Phase 1 provide a proof of concept of the identified VSA framework with respect to its implementation into current simulation products.  The VSA will consider all current virtual simulation systems and the future needs of the Army in training in a virtual environment such as Soldier CATT and Future Combat System (FCS). The current list of virtual simulations within PM CATT is provided with referenced documents.  Phase 1 should provide a logical grouping of these systems (i.e.: individual training, collective training, etc.). The VSA should be consistent with the DoD Architectural Framework policies and procedures.  The VSA will be used as the foundation for SE Core and all future virtual simulation systems. VSA will be used as the enabling framework for providing interoperability between current and future virtual simulation systems.  The VSA must consider the use of the Objective OneSAF System (OOS) within the virtual domain and CTIA-TENA as the architecture employed for live training in support of a seamless training environment. VSA must consider the database needs of all elements of virtual simulations.  

Phase 1 will be a 6 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $400,000.  


PHASE 2. The VSA will be used as the foundation architectural framework for the SE Core program and the development of its Key Performance Parameters. This phase will address evolution, refinement, and expansion of the Phase 1 framework to address specific needs in SE Core and how the VSA will be employed to address domain-wide common components (i.e.: Common Database Generation, Computer Generated Force (CGF), Instructor Operator Station (IOS), etc.)  

Phase 2 will be a 12 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $800,000.
 
There will be at least 2 mandatory formal urniture, doors, and ventilation grills.  It also includes the implementation of  requirements for non-spatial representations that capture functional characteristics of environmental objects, i.e.: that a particular power panel controls a certain area of lighting, signage or electric outlets; that a particular wall provides load-bearing support to specific overhead objects; that damage to a particular power pylon affects power distribution to specific industrial facilities; and that contamination in a certain water reservoir or water distribution facility affects specific water distribution points.  Aspects of these requirements have been captured in Environmental Data Models (EDMs) for specific systems, such as the OOS EDM for Ultra-High Resolution Buildings (UHRB), the OOS EDM for Terrain and SECORE.
8.	Developing prototype products that can be integrated into the SE Core STDGS baseline. The development of the urban database generation system (tools and processes) will be driven by increasingly realistic demonstrations.
9.	The contractors will propose specific component-level assessment metrics to be used in such component-specific experiments. The following metrics shall be accessed and met by the end of phase II:   The technology developed shall be accessed in training and simulation systems to demonstrate that a better, faster, cheaper urban terrain generation capability has been achieved to support mission rehearsal, training, planning, and course of action analysis.   The threshold for urban terrain database development time is three (3) weeks with an objective of two (2) weeks.   The resolution threshold for high fidelity (high attribution/high fidelity ground and underground structures) database development cost is $300K with a goal of $100K. The target nominal database size is a 2.5km x 2.5km urban terrain database at high fidelity derived from a DTED level 5 or data source equivalent. 




BACKGROUND: The Rapid Construction of Urban Terrain Databases for Training program focuses on the challenge of providing a database generation system supported by automated processes and toolsets that enable representations and multiple formats of three-dimensional urban terrain databases. Furthermore, there must be support to include the urban battle space representation for training, planning, and mission rehearsal by creating, modifying and sharing data and complex models via a common Modeling and Simulation infrastructure. There is an increasing demand for the generation, representations and impact of simulated urban terrain, environment for use in training, mission rehearsal, planning, analysis, development, and operational tests and evaluations. These simulated battlefield environments must exhibit realistic representations and interactions between computer generated forces and as perceived by humans, both synchronized in time and space such that war fighters, both individually and collectively, experience the complexity of dynamic force-on-force battlespace awareness. Moreover, the simulated environments must be accredited based on validated models, processes and methodologies.   In a number of recent requirements documents, US military leaders call for the development of techniques and tools to address this critical challenge. In the US Army Community, the need for a capability to provide battlespace awareness that can provide rapid production of geo-specific regions from multi-spectral/textured representations, common database, dynamic terrain features, complex models/shapes, and free moving objects to standard and open processes and tools is imminent.  Today's practices of military war fighters and decision-making do include a number of processes specifically aimed at identifying static battlefield representations.  Currently, these processes and tools are largely manual, as well as stovepiped, and do not involve any significant use of cost effective automation that is repeatable and standardized. Other flaws of the current Army geospatial data processes include: lack of accurate data, inconsistency among data providers, and incomplete tool sets for data integration and validation, lack of data standards, no central control or management.  Thus, the challenge is to evolve effective methodologies and techniques for the development of a database generation system with tools and processes to support rapid urban terrain database generation for different levels of terrain resolution and complex models shapes.  This must include correlated databases that support simulation functions such as semi-automated forces, embedded training and embedded simulation; verification and validation of correlated databases for visual, plan view displays; and paper and electronic maps for tactical training systems in support of future instantiations for the Interim and Objective Force.  Moreover, these methodologies shall facilitate the transfer and reuse of existing terrain database formats in support of disparate M&S systems. The Future Force will also use terrain data in modeling and simulation formats to conduct training prior to deploying forces to combat.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), N61339-01-R-0023, was issued in the CBD on 1 March 2001, by U. S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation,Training, and Instrumentation(PEO STRI). This notice covers Amendment A003 which incorporates a new research topic #7, COLLISION AVOIDANCE DEMONSTRATION and calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to this effort, entitled Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) Sensor Integrated Real Time Information System (OSIRIS) Program. POC: Ms. H. Michelle Kalphat, RDECOM STC Agent for DARPA.  SPONSOR:  Mr. Sam Wilson, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office (TTO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Facsimile: (407) 384-3862, E-mail: Michelle_Kalphat@peostri.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual point of contact: NAWC-TSD Contracts Office,  Attn: Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, Code 25353, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826. OBJECTIVE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office (TTO) OSIRIS project is essential in order to transition the small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) into the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and other DOD programs in support of deployed U.S. forces.  The Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) and Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) projects engage in advanced military research projects, which will have significant impact on the defense posture of the country.  The OAV/MAV ACTD projects goal is to provide superior U.S. military systems in the areas of distributed autonomous air vehicles the ability to provide surveillance and reconnaissance to small units. These systems will improve U.S. effectiveness in deterring conventional and terrorists? warfare on both foreign and domestic territories.  In pursuit of this mission, the program has to perform two main functions.  The first function is the transition of this revolutionary weapon systems and associated subsystems to the appropriate military units.   Secondly, the program will continue to identify and exploit new technologies, which will serve as the basis for revolutionary systems development, maintain the necessary margin of technological superiority, and provide the flexibility and option for responding to changing U.S. strategy.  To facilitate this effort, DARPA TTO is soliciting white papers (technical and cost) from qualified contractors for the assessment and development of a sensor suite system highlighting advanced technology for small autonomous air vehicles that will provide situation awareness, target location, collision avoidance and operations in complex terrain.  The OSIRIS Program is a 4 year DARPA initiative to develop a sensor suite system for the Organic Air Vehicle and will assess strengths and limitations of each sensor suite system based on actual field experiments under the following flight test conditions: under the canopy, MOUT, inside buildings, and inside caves and tunnels; and will develop and validate critical technology for understanding sensor suite system performance with coordinated use of small numbers of vehicles and degraded communications or sensors.  The overall purpose of this research and development efforts is to enhance DoD's capabilities for enabling collision avoidance in the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) 9 inch version of the GFE ducted fan vehicle and securing/transmitting information for battle damage assessment.   ACQUISTION INFORMATION: In order to accomplish this, DARPA TTO solicits qualified offerors (teams are encouraged) to submit white papers for the development, demonstration, and delivery of a complete functional prototype collision avoidance system using the GFE 9 inch air vehicle that includes the proposed sensor system package that consists but is not limited to, mono-vision, stereo-vision (visible and IR), acoustic, LIDAR and RADAR sensor technologies. The program effort will consist of three oA provides information and data to document rationale for adopting an evolutionary or single-step strategy with cost, schedule and performance goals for the total R&D program and specific goals and test plans for the first technology spiral, which will assist in the development of the recommended technology development strategy.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: 
Demonstrate a field capable mounted/dismounted embedded training systems for the Embedded Combined Arms Team Training and Mission Rehearsal (ECATT-MR) Science and Technology Objective (STO).  These systems will lay the groundwork for future Army embedded systems that will provide deployable sustainment training and mission rehearsal for combined arms forces that accurately replicate the Contemporary Operational Environment. These systems will allow mounted/dismounted forces to train and perform mission rehearsal on demand without significant external support. The goal is to move the mounted /dismounted interoperable embedded training technologies to a Technology Readiness Level of 6 (which is a prototype demonstration in a relevant environment). A dismounted squad level unit using these systems supplemented by other embedded dismounted prototypes with one Future Combat System (FCS) Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) like vehicle will do a mission rehearsal with the system and supporting capabilities such as Mission Walkthrough and After Action Review (AAR). The utility of the system to train, perform mission rehearsal and distributed AAR under likely field conditions will be evaluated.
 
RESEARCH AREAS OF INTEREST
RDECOM STTC is interested in those technologies for future mounted/dismounted embedded training. The goal is to focus on the demonstration of a future mounted/dismounted interoperable embedded training solution for FCS Manned Ground Vehicles (MGV) and supporting dismounted forces. 

The following narrative provides an abbreviated description of the prospective research areas.  The description is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit innovative white papers/proposals that have the potential to dramatically expand and enhance the technologies to be pursued in the specific area of interest described below.  Any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals:


The research area will:

·	Fully Immersive Man wearable Dismounted Embedded Virtual Simulation – demonstrate a Man wearable virtual simulation that provides effective embedded simulation and mission rehearsal capabilities within the future hardware footprints of a Land Warrior (LW) or Future Force Warrior (FFW) like system. This requires consideration of factors like weight, battery life and man wearable human factors. Other likely technology areas for improvement include; Helmet mounted or other display technologies, Wearable Computers, Movement tracking, and movement control. The system will track the body and weapon movements of the trainee and correlate them to the virtual environment. The system will be able to provide sensor and communication capabilities to coordinate collectively with other dismounted player units and the Mounted Force which will be represented by the Future Combat System (FCS) Infantry Carrier Testbed. The system will implement a limited set of Joint Variable Message (JVMF) messages to perform mounted/dismounted coordination. The offeror will need to deliver between 1 to 4 prototypes of the player units for experimentation.

·	Creative Low Cost

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), N61339-01-R-0023, was issued in the CBD on 1 March 2001, by the Research Development Engineering Command Simulation Technology Center (RDECOM),U. S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (formerly STRICOM) and the Army Research Institute (ARI).  This notice is in reference to the original synopsis of 26 August 2003, which calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research effort entitled, "Special Reconnaissance Simulator Research & Development Project."  This request for research effort has been cancelled in it's entirety.  Those participants who submitted white papers in reference to this call will be provided written notification of this cancellation.  discrete phases. White papers are solicited to develop and demonstrate a functional (non-form factored) prototype MAV sensor system for detecting/sensing, and avoiding obstacles with the 9 inch air vehicle In response to the white paper evaluation, the Government intends to select no more than five (5) offerors to participate in Phase I.  Phase I will be approximately 6 months duration and will culminate in a preliminary design that specifies the particular sensor system technology being recommended to include design and performance considerations and tradeoffs.  For the proposed systems, focus should be on control algorithms, how the decision process is accomplished, integration of sensors into the vehicle, and a well defined path towards Phase II and Phase III demonstration requirements.  At the completion of the Phase I Preliminary Design Review (PDR), the government will select two or more offerors to continue with Phase II.  Only those offerors selected from Phase I will participate in Phase II.  Phase II will be approximately 18 months in duration and will culminate in a demonstration of the collision avoidance system integrated in the GFE 9 inch air vehicle flying in and around buildings in a MOUT-like environment under limited GPS conditions.  At the end of Phase II, the government will select one contractor to continue the Phase III portion of the requirement.  Phase III will be approximately 2 years in duration and will focus on sensing, deciding and collision avoidance movement of the air vehicle in tunnels and caves. The system will exploit, but not be restricted to mono-vision, stereo-vision, acoustic, LIDAR and RADAR.  White papers must address requirements for all 3 phases and shall not exceed 7 pages in length, to include all pages.  Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  Since the Phase II portion will only be considered from those offerors that are selected to accomplish the Phase I work, all white papers need to include Phase II and Phase III efforts as priced options.  It is DARPAs intent to distribute the Interface Control Document (ICD) for the MAV to those offerors invited to participate in the Phase II portion of this requirement.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  Proposals will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives.  Subsequently, offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received.  Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part.  White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board considering the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:  (1) innovative and creative technical approaches; (2) understanding of the technical issues and risks; (3) soundness of the technical and management approach; (4) offeror's relevant experience, facilities and availability of qualified, experienced technical personnel; (5) organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposal. Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation.  This announcement solicits white papers from the widest number of offerors, including qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs, and DOE laboratories.  Offerors are encouraged to provide other creative and /or innovative ideas/solutions to stated objectives contained in this announcement as part of the white paper approach... Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitute the Government's solicitation for this effort.  Any awards resulting out of this announcement may take the form of traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts, cooperative agreements and Other Transaction Agreements. No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of the solicited tasks for exclusive competition among the entries.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Each proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this announcement are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.

For those offerors who have already submitted their proposal IAW previous instructions, please provide the undersigned point of contact with dispostion instructions for your proposal.  Also, please provide the undersigned verification that you have received and read this notice or the e-mail notification to follow.  POC: Debra Leuschel (407)384-3624 or Debra_Leuschel@peostri.army.mil.ludes, but is not limited to, intensification, filtering, creation of new or artificial data, correlation between different data sets and types.  An open, API to the MDB shall be developed and documented.  Documentation shall be provided of the hardware and software tool suite solution including, but not limited to, computers, data storage, plotters, printers, digitizers, network infrastructure, database preview capabilities and COTS tools.  As part of the STDGC documentation, the architecture of the MDB editing capability and relationships between the individual tools within the tool suite shall be described.  
3.	Research, design and develop a Runtime Database Generation Toolset (RDGT) capability.  It shall use the open API to the MDB to extract and then dynamically manipulate and generate SE data based on confederacy defined rules.  These rules shall be defined via a user interface and shall include, but is not limited to, defining feature interactions, content fidelity and acceptable geometric correlation error tolerances.  Using these rules, the RDGT shall include, but not be limited to, the capabilities of supporting multiple culture feature thinning methods, multiple terrain skinning methods, cultural feature to feature interactions, and cultural feature integration with terrain.  An open, plug-in based, API shall be developed to access this dynamically manipulated and generated SE data.  This architecture shall allow simulation vendors to write software plug-ins to the RDGT that will then format the data from the RDGT to the simulation systems vendors run-time database formats.  This API shall be capable of supporting the requirements of multiple simulation vendors and their data formatting requirements, creating correlated databases for disparate simulation systems using this common software process.  
4.	Research and design the hardware and software for the prototype database generation facility based on your solution for the STDGC, and then construct the prototype to test and demonstrate the end to end processes.  The design of the STDGC must take into consideration the support of an information assurance plan that is consistent with the prevailing DoD standards for sensitive and secret data sets. 
BACKGROUND:  The Army strives for more efficiency in the development and support of training and simulation systems.  To this end, several initiatives are underway within PEO STRI to develop common architectures and processes, utilizing the product-line approach.  These initiatives include the SE Core for virtual simulation, Army Constructive Training Federation (ACTF) for constructive simulations, and the Common Training Information Architecture (CTIA) for live training.  In concert, the Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) initiative is working to integrate the three domains to create a LVC training environment.   SE Core is the Army’s virtual component of the LVC-IA. 
SE Core will develop and integrate new and existing software and hardware products to create the Army’s Common Virtual Environment (CVE). The CVE will link system and non-system virtual simulations into a fully integrated training capability.  
A significant output of the SE Core components will be rapidly generated, correlated terrain databases generated by the STDGC process.  The SE Core program will develop automated terrain database processes, tool sets, and a master library of terrain data.  Additional terrain development efforts will leverage urban operations insets, dynamic terrain, atmospheric effects, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High Explosive (CBRNE), and visual models.  This will provide a common environmental representation enhancing interoperability while providing efficiencies.  
PROGRAM SCOPE:  A phased approach to this effort is sought. White Papers should address a basic award (Phase I) and 1 priced option (Phase II) as stated below.  This effort is expected not to exceed 16 months in leng

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), N61339-01-R-0023, was issued in the CBD on 1 March 2001, by U. S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM).  This notice is issued in regard to the call for White Paper Submissions in reference to the effort, entitled High Level Architecture (HLA)/Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)Project, POC: Ms. Susan Marshall, Joint Advance Distance Learning (ADL), Project Lead, E-mail: NAWC-TSD Contracts Office, ATTN: Ms. Debra Leuschel, Senior Contract Specialist, Code 25353, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL (407)384-3624.  DESIGN CRITERIA is corrected as follows: (5) The Offeror shall address Use Case A or B per the referenced document.  Addressing Use Case C or developing another use case may facilitate a better design is also encouraged. 
 approaches to provide Dismounted embedded virtual and constructive Simulation – Demonstrate alternative dismounted embedded player unit designs to provide effective collective training and mission rehearsal without the complexity of the fully immersive player unit. The player unit will be within the future hardware footprints of a Land Warrior (LW) or Future Force Warrior (FFW) like system. Will have the ability to provide sensor and communication capabilities to coordinate collectively with other dismounted player units and the Mounted Force, which will be represented by the FCS Infantry Carrier Vehicle Testbed. The system will allow the player to engage the enemy with realistic results. The system will implement a limited set of JVMF messages to perform mounted/dismounted coordination. The offeror will need to deliver between 1 to 4 prototypes of the player units for experimentation.

·	Distributed / Embedded AAR – Demonstrate an AAR concept for embedded simulation. This system will utilize the Dismounted Embedded player units (both immersive and low-cost systems) and the mounted players which are represented by the FCS ICV Testbed to provide and control the AAR. Information will be distributed among the embedded player units allowing them to and participate and understand the exercise flow rather than following a more traditional AAR approach which would occur in a theater. The AAR should be simple to use and focus on usability for a unit in the field. It is envisioned that this effort would be on top of an existing AAR system with the focus being how to distribute and effectively coordinate the AAR using the embedded player units. The system will implement a limited set of JVMF messages to perform mounted/dismounted coordination.

·	Mission Planning (MP)/Walkthrough for Embedded Simulation – Demonstrate a system to perform mission planning with the embedded mounted and dismounted systems. The system will be easy to use and allow the embedded operators to provide a mission walkthrough before its execution The system will provide a 3D visualization of database, units and key points of the mission/exercise. The system will allow tactical control measures to be visible in the 3D view. Ideally the system will also support a 2D view. The system will look into supporting the behaviors of the OPposing FORce (OPFOR) by downloading OPFOR parameters into OneSAF Testbed Baseline (OTB) or OneSAF Objective System (OOS). 


·	Embedded Architecture Research – Demonstrate improved embedded architectures using FCS common components such as the OneSAF Objective system to build a streamlined embedded simulation engine. The system shall integrate with the ICV embedded test beds in the STTC lab and the dismounted embedded player units. The system shall also provide simulation of FCS robotic systems from the mounted and dismounted player units. 

·	Embedded Augmented Reality (AR) Capability – demonstrate a fully embedded augmented reality (AR) capability on one of the following platforms: 

(1)  A Land Warrior/Future Force Warrior (LW/FFW) - type surrogate, configured completely as man-wearable and untethered from any additional off-board computing and/or sensor infrastructure.  All equipment for presentation of AR to the dismounted soldier shall be carried on the soldier system.

(2)  An FCS like Manned Ground Vehicle (MGV) platform testbed - The system shall provide for the integration of data from Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) linkages and present this data as 2D/3D graphics and entities, mixed and injected into the subject field of view (display) of the real environment.  Virtual objects would include targets, special weapons effects, CGF, graphical situational awareness data, phase lines, target reference points, etc.  

The initial demonstration with the AR player units shall be provided in the STTC Lab NLT Fall 05. Final demonstration shall be in the Fall of 06, the goal of this demo is untethered under outdoor condition

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the dates listed in the White Paper/Proposal Submission paragraphs: Favorable notification of white papers will be accomplished by 20 May 2003.  Proposals will be due by 20 June 2003.  Phase I Awards are anticipated during September 2003.  All other information in the original announcement remains unchanged. s.   Delivery of one prototype system shall be required.

·	Intelligent Structured Training  - Demonstrate improved embedded training and mission rehearsal capabilities through use of embedded Intelligent Tutoring Systems(ITS) to provide an Intelligent Structured Training capability. This will allow duty station task training in the vehicle without any instructors. The goal of this ITS will be to monitor tactical decision making, in real time, based upon Army Tactics, Techniques and Procedures.  The ITS should provide one-on-one feedback, or “tutoring,” to the soldier based on the quality of observed behavior.  The Intelligent Structured Training technologies shall use either the ICV or the Command and Control Vehicle testbed to integrate their products and conduct initial and final demonstrations. The ITS component will be designed to provide real time feedback to the soldier during training and mission rehearsal by providing dynamic feedback using the capabilities of the system, including the Soldier Machine Interface, 3D Audio and other such mechanisms.  The ITS will be capable of dynamically evaluating student decisions such that the scenarios and evaluations do not have to be pre-defined.  The ITS will be easy to configure and develop evaluations for real-time mission rehearsal. The ease of authoring new training scenarios is critical.  The system should interface to likely FCS components like OneSAF to provide Opposing Force (OPFOR) and friendly Computer Generated Forces (CGF) needed to train the tasks. The effort will require reports describing system design, interfaces, and ITS evaluation authoring tool and any experimental results. 


PROGRAM SCOPE
RDECOM STTC anticipates making awards in each research area with the dollar amounts for the research areas typically ranging between $100,000 to $400,000 for each.  The planned method for accomplishing the research in each prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.  Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the  technical approach/solution for the proposed research area(s) address a Basic Effort (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II).  The white paper needs to address at least one of the research areas listed above and must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and planned approach to accomplish any operational demonstrations as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.   (See Phase I and Phase II information below for additional requirements).

PHASE I.  
Phase I will be a 12 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 -$400,000 per research area.  The effort will culminate in an initial demonstration in the Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) in Fall 2005. The efforts will require reports describing the system description /design, interfaces, findings/conclusions, and any experimentation results.  The systems will be Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) interoperable with the FCS ICV Testbed and other player units. A common database(s) using Openflight format will be provided in support of the experiments 
 

PHASE II. 
Phase II will be a 12 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 -$400,000 per research area. Final Demonstration will be at the ECATT-MR STO Culminating Event in Fall 2006. This event shall demonstrate a field capable mounted/dismounted system moving the mounted /dismounted technology to a prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. A dismounted squad level unit using this system supplemented by other embedded dismounted prototypes with one FCS Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) like vehicle will do a mission rehearsal with the system and supporting elements like Mission Planning and After Action Review (AAR). The unit would then carry out the actual live training mission. The utility of the system to train and perform mission rehearsal will be evaluated.


There will be at least 2 mandatory formal technical interchange meetings during Phase 1. Each proposal shall include a statement that the offeror agrees to: a) the formal exchange of technical information with other ECATT-MR STO Programs, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and b) participation in the interchange meetings.

Reference Documents are provided on the PEO STRI website at www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/ECATT-MR.jsp

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center RDECOM STTC (formerly STRICOM). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-E. Rapid Construction of Urban Terrain Databases” Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Julio de la Cruz, RDECOM STTC, (407)384-3733, julio.delacruz@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. 

OBJECTIVE: The Rapid Construction of Urban Terrain Databases for Training Program will develop an open database generation system supported by automated processes and tools that enable rapid generation of realistic geospecific representation (databases) of urban environments for tactical operations.  The database generation system shall provide three-dimensional (3D) geospatial representation of the urban battlespace by: 
 
1.	Developing viable methodologies and technologies to support the rapid construction of geospecific urban terrain databases. The open database generation system will overcome manual and manpower intensive processes by developing automated tools for construction of complex and high resolution geospecific urban digital terrain.  Urban digital terrain is described as, but not limited to, elevations, features, and attributes provided by, but not limited to, information provided in maps, geospatial systems and geospecific overhead imagery from authoritative data providers, 1:12.5K scale or better data sets.  
2.	Evolving open standards and automated tools for the generation of 3D models and artifacts.  There is high interest in developing the representations of subterranean and above ground structures and interiors but no limited to those representations. The representation can be built from the following sources, but not limited to, a photograph, video, CAD drawing, and LIDAR imagery, building floor plans and other architectural/engineering/construction (A/E/C) data formats.   The evolved open standards shall leverage the definition of common standard for data integration between constructive, virtual, and live models and simulations (M&S) for urban training requirements. 
3.	Developing methodologies and technologies to support seamless correlation between the open database generation system and disparate M&S run time systems.  Methodologies to include management techniques allowing for the automated insertion/removal of 3D models or artifacts within the geospecific digital terrain.
4.	Developing methodologies and technologies for realistic dynamic modeling of weapons effects on 3D models or artifacts in a real time dynamic environment.  Placing emphasis on interoperability between OOS models and the virtual environment visual representation. 
5.	Leveraging and integrating the open database generation system into the   Synthetic Environment (SE) CORE program. The open database generation system shall address current and future Army systems requirements for geospatial data and services across the urban operation spectrum of Army activities. 
6.	Evolving common data models and representations for geospecific urban terrain, focusing on defining and extending a shared urban terrain representation.  This serves as a basis for setting data-provision objectives for authoritative data providers, and data-sharing objectives for Army application.
7.	Developing methodologies and technologies for implementation  and capture of  realistic urban representation, and effectively using representations of interiors and structure of buildings, tunnels, sewers, and the placement and state of smaller structures such as f

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (formerly STRICOM) publicized Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 in the CBD on 01 March 2001.  This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, 7.0 “Additional Research Topics, LVC-IA Joint Seamless Interoperable Training Environment.”   The Technical Point of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Mark Jozwiak, PEO STRI, PM FF (S), (407) 384-3729, mark.jozwiak@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). The Contractual Point of Contact:  Ms. Gloria Bailey, NAVAIR Orlando TSD, Code 25343.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:
The objective of the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) program is to create a Joint, Integrated LVC environment & capability that allows Army forces to routinely train/operate in the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) / Joint Operating Environment (JOE) as part of a Joint Task Force (JTF).  

The objective LVC-IA is to:  1.  Implement a standardized set of protocols, specifications, and standards that permit interoperability and integration among Army & Joint LVC components. 
2.  Provide an integrated LVC environment that ensures compatibility and interoperability for all TADSS and fully embeds into Future Force Battle Command System, while linking to and stimulating Joint Command and Control (JC2) systems.  3.  Provide “Plug and Train” capability to support operations, mission planning-rehearsal, on demand, anytime, and anywhere, while training in a Joint context.  4.  Permits interoperability and integration among- a.  Joint Family of Simulations (JFOM)(JNTC Efforts). b.  Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA).  c.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core. d.  Army Constructive Training Federation (ACTF). e.  Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA). f.  Other Potential LVC components (FCS FoS, WIN-T…).  g.  Embeds into and stimulates JC2.

PROGRAM SCOPE:
The required research is for the development of the LVC-IA Technology Development Strategy (TDS) and technical direction for the LVC-IA base program Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The acquisition framework for the base LVC-IA program incorporates a Technology Development Phase focused on the development, maturation, and evaluation of the technologies needed for the capability under consideration.  This phase of activities concentrate on maturing those technologies (consistent with recommended Technology Readiness Levels) and demonstrating readiness to proceed with program initiation. This document is developed during the Concept Refinement phase for the base LVC-IA program to support the program’s Milestone A decision.  The TDS outlines the plan for conducting the Technology Development phase, to include:  a.) Rationale for adopting an evolutionary or single-step-to-full-capability strategy; description of how the program will be divided into technology spirals and development increments tied to the AoA. b.) Cost, schedule and performance goals for the total R&D program; and specific goals and test plans for the first technology spiral synchronized with the AoA finding.

 The TDS is done concurrently and simultaneously with the LVC-IA base program AoA. This AoA is an analysis of the operational effectiveness and estimated life cycle costs for alternative materiel systems required to meet or eliminate identified gaps and shortfalls in the existing operational capabilities. During this TDS effort, in conjunction with AoA, you will provide the technical direction for the future LVC Integrated Architecture. Your technical recommendations will be required to assist TRADOC (TRAC WSMR & NSC) and the PEO with the AoA analysis and evaluation of a range of specific hardware and software alternatives identified in the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and to focus on how to provide the needed capabilities while reducing cost and risk. Additionally, the A

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (formerly STRICOM). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-D. Synthetic Environment Data Modeling, Interchange, Access, and Reuse Development Effort” Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Ms. Connie Perry, PEO STRI, (407)384-3920, Connie.Perry@peostri.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. 
PROBLEM: A solution to the miscorrelation and non-interoperability of Synthetic Environment (SE) databases across a confederacy of simulation vendors has long been a challenge that continues to elude the industry.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core’s goal is to resolve these correlation and interoperability issues or at least mitigate and manage the problem.  
CONCEPT OVERVIEW: The high-level concept is to develop the capability to generate rapid, correlated SE databases for a simulation confederacy using a common robust, fully attributed master database and a software architecture that  employs the use of COTS tools, common SE database generation processes and confederate specific software plug-ins via a public Application Programmers Interface (API).  Since the generation of the SE representation is common to all confederate plug-in applications, all exported confederate databases are insured of at least starting with a common representation of the SE.
OBJECTIVE: Soliciting innovation and ideas for the performance of research, development, design, and testing that directly supports advancement to the establishment of the Standard/Rapid Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC). The STDGC will incorporate automated processes to generate databases within 96 hours (with a goal of 72 hours or better) of receipt of properly attributed source data.  If properly attributed source data is not available then the STDGC will allow for the generation of compliant databases through user interaction.  For a more in-depth overview on the entire STDGC concept read the “Concept Paper for the Standard/Rapid Terrain Database Generation Capability in Support of the Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Initiative” located at http://www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/SECORE-STDGC.jsp. 
TECHNICAL PROOF OF CONCEPT AREAS FOR THE STDGC:
1.	Research, design and develop the capability to generate and verify a Master Database (MDB) of synthetic environment (SE) data.  This capability includes importing, via a user interface, common standard source data (including digital elevation data, cultural feature data, geo-typical and geo-specific imagery, weather data, CAD and simulation modeling formats, feature models, SEDRIS and emerging source formats). The import capability should convert from different coordinate systems and datums to a common geodetic coordinate system and encode all attribution that is required by other processes in the STDGC into a MDB.  The MDB data schema and organizational design for storing SE data shall be documented, including the utilization of multi-resolution and multi-representation versions of models and terrain (if any), an environmental data model (EDM) and a data representation model (DRM). Also, coordinate the integration of the Rapid Generation of Urban Terrain Databases STO into the STDGC.  Through automated processes the MDB shall be verified to contain the content and attribution required by a simulation confederacy.
2.	Research, design and develop the capability to edit and maintain the MDB.  Using COTS tools to the greatest extent possible, in a configuration managed environment, edit and maintain the MDB which inc

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative changes are: (1) Correct the mailing address of the technical POC; (2) deletion of the requirement to send a cover page to the Small Business office, and (3) deletion of the Ombudsman program.  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing.  No other changes have been made.

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for various studies and experiments to increase AFRL's knowledge and understanding of audio and speech processing technologies for support of military operations.  Solutions using new and innovative approaches are sought.  The scope of this effort covers a broad range of audio and speech processing technologies not limited to: speaker identification, language/ sublanguage (sometimes called dialect) identification, gisting (obtaining the gist of a conversation by recognition of words and phrases), language translation, platform/background noise identification, usable speech determination, interference (noise and competing talkers) reduction, voice stress analysis, speaker verification, coding to preserve the characteristics of the talker and channel, watermarking, and correlation.  Emphasis for this research are techniques and methods for use in tactical (Avg. 9 dB signal-to-noise ratio, <5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time) military environment.  Deliverables will be technical reports, and when appropriate, demonstrations and associated data.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a five (5) to seven (7) page white paper on their proposed research topic with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, small women-owned small or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institutions. All responses to this BAA must be addressed to the technical point of contact: AFRL/IFEC, Attn: John G. Parker, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary.

Multiple white papers addressing different areas of applicability may be submitted by each offeror and are encouraged. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.

Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria in descending order of importance: (1) The Overall Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Contributions to the Tactical Speech Processing mission, (3) Innovative Approach and/or Techniques, (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously. The technical criteria, 1-3 above, will also be used to determine whether the white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. In addition, the Government may consider other factors such as: (1) The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (2) The qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel; and (3) The offeror’s record of past and present performance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. Principle funding for proposals selected from this announcement will begin in FY02 with awards not normally exceeding twenty-four (24) months in duration and $700,000 in value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Total funding for the BAA is $23M.

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, United States Air Force employs various types of combat aircraft around the world to support steady state and contingency operations. Typically these aircraft are very expensive to procure and operate.  The current combat aircraft in the inventory have been designed with specific capabilities for specific missions.  The operational flight programs are very often proprietary in nature and expensive and timely to update. The AWB is interested in existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Government-Off-The-Shelf  (GOTS) aircraft that could be used as-is to perform the low threat missions that do not warrant using F-16’s, F-15’s, A-10’s or other expensive assets.  Such missions may be: Non Traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Counter Insurgency, Counter Narcotics, Homeland Defense, etc.

	These attributes are of specific interest:

1.	Low initial procurement cost.  (less than 5 million). 
2.	Open architecture, No proprietary software; COTS & GOTS communication interfaces, ethernet and 1553 BUS to weapons stations. 
3.	Capability to operate from unimproved airfields, dirt strips.
4.	Very fuel efficient compared to F-15, F-16, and A-10
5.	Night vision goggle compatible cockpit.
6.	Two place configuration.

	These attributes are considered beneficial:

1.	Cockpit protection against small arms fire
2.	Supported by existing USAF ground support equipment
3.	Ejection seats
4.	Single and two place configurations.
5.	Have self protection suite i.e. chaff, flares.

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the aircraft.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above items of specific interest and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.	Interest to conduct a tactical demonstration of your aircraft.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 23 Apr 05 to Lt Col William Sobrero, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Lt Col Sobrero can be reached at (208) 828-3506; william.sobrero@mountainhome.af.mil.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<SUBJECT>12--NATO SEASPARROW CONSORTIUM COMMON MISSILE LIBRARY (CML) REVISION E
<SOLNBR>N0002405R5491
<CONTACT>James Scharrer, Contract Specialist, SEA 02541J, 202-781-4245.   L. Dwayne Weaver, Contracting Officer,  SEA 02541, 202-781-3959
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and the NATO SEASPARROW Project Office (NSPO) seek information for market research and planning purposes for development of Revision E to the NATO SEASPARROW Consortium CML.  The NATO SEASPARROW Project is a NATO Cooperative Project with twelve Participating Governments.  Similar announcement material and an Invitation to Register Interest (i.e., Request for Information) has been provided for posting by all twelve Participating Governments in accordance with their national procedures.  This announcement and request for information is issued in order to determine the level of industry interest and expertise in development of CML Revision E as described below. Purpose 1.	The Naval Sea Systems Command and the NATO SEASPARROW Project Office (NSPO) are seeking expressions of interest from companies with the technical, managerial and financial capability to conduct the CML revision E effort. The successful offeror will be expected to develop and implement performance based engagement capability in a data base environment.  This CML product will expand upon the existing in-service CML version. Background 2.	The Common Missile Library (CML) is a collection of software functions for the computation of intercept and engagement data, plus related performance parameters, which are used by the Fire Control Systems (FCS)/Command and Control Systems (CCS) of platforms operating the RIM-7 SEASPARROW or RIM-162 Evolved SEASPARROW (ESSM) missiles. Lately, new and significant developments have taken place within the ESSM program related to the different and improved guidance modes. Although these new features have a considerable impact on the intercept characteristics of the missile, they are not accommodated for in the current CML, which is only optimized to support the Home All the Way (HAW) mode of the ESSM.  3.	Furthermore, continuous improvements to the available on-board weapon systems, in particular significantly increased computational power, offer new opportunities for generic combat system functionality that can be incorporated in a future CML. Acquisition Timeframe 4.	NAVSEA and NSPO anticipate inviting proposals from companies, based on response to this ITR, in Spring 2005 and are targeting award of a contract in October this year, for completion of Revision E over an 18 month implementation phase.  Statement of Work Overview 5.	The CML Revision E product will focus on the integration of Performance Based Engageability (PBE) for the RIM-162 ESSM and the following functional improvements: ·	Convert 3D Target Data to 2D Target Data ·	Calculate Probability Of Missile Effectiveness ·	Calculate Missile Fly-Out Trajectory Prediction ·	Mode Selection  ·	Calculate Performance Based Engageability In addition, it is anticipated that Revision E will provide the following additional improvements: ·	High Order Language (HOL) conversion (C versus Ada). ·	Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction System (AREPS) Integration (in support of refining Performance Based Engageability (PBE) solutions). ·	Modularized software (to support tailoring by end-user countries). ·	Corrections of high priority Software Trouble Reports (STRs). Evaluation Criteria 6.	Respondents to this announcement will be evaluated based on the following criteria: a)	Respondent's technical, managerial and financial capability to fulfill the requirement; b)	Respondent's past performance in projects of a similar type and scope to the requirement defined in this announcement. Specific examples of previous experience and accreditation would be looked upon favorably; and c)	The respondent's demonstrated ability to comply with, or obtain, personnel and property security levels up to Secret level.  7.	In the event a competitive solicitation results from this market research, respondents to this request for information found suitable for further consideration will be included on a list and invited to formally tender an offer for the CML Rev E development. Disclaimer 8.	Release of this Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute any obligation on the part of the NSPO to (1) select any respondent for later tendering action; or (2) proceed with acquisition of the requirement outlined in this RFI. The NSPO may at any time, without obligation or liability, cancel this RFI. Lodgment Requirements 9.	As this is an Invitation to Register Interest, responses should be brief (e.g. less than ten legal sized pages) but sufficient to address the evaluation criteria identified. To be considered, responses shall be in Microsoft Word format, Unclassified and in English. Pricing information is not sought at this time. Lodgment of Interest shall be accepted up to COB 15 April 2005 and can be submitted through the following mediums: Mail to:  Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command MS 2040; ATTN:  SEA 02541, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC  20376-2040!!

<DESC>The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is an independent agency in the executive branch of the federal government.  Its primary mission is to pay retirement and survivor benefits to railroad retirees and their families, as well as unemployment benefits to current rail employees.  The RRB’s Executive Committee completed a facilitated review of agency operations last year, with limited budgetary resources the driving force behind this undertaking.  The agency currently has 53 field offices, plus 3 regional offices, with approximately 300 employees.  The field offices range in size from 3 to 12 employees, with 4 authorized positions in each regional office.

A key recommendation in the resulting report by the Executive Committee involved realigning the agency’s field office structure to establish a system of regionalized customer service centers.   However, the proposed structure would take a number of years to implement, and budgetary resources are expected to remain extremely tight or even decline.  As a result, the RRB is interested in obtaining the assistance of a contractor that would evaluate relevant workload and performance data from the field offices, along with the previous referenced recommendation, and identify the most effective and efficient configuration for future operation. We are seeking contractors with extensive experience in governmental reorganizations, consolidations and reconfigurations.

For additional information on this request, please contact Bruce Rodman in the Office of Administration, U.S. RRB, 844 North Rush, Rm. 536, Chicago, IL  60611.  The contact telephone number is 312/751-4932, or by e-mail at bruce.rodman@rrb.gov.

<DESC>This announcement is to determine the availability of design-build construction firms for a proposed project at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories campus operated by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases in Hamilton, Montana.  Acquisition is being managed by the Division of Engineering Services, IHS, under an intra-agency agreement with NIH. ---- Responses to this announcement will be considered in determining whether to proceed under a two-phase design-build acquisition process and, if so, whether competition will be limited under one of the small business set-aside programs.  This is not an offer to contract nor is it a Phase One solicitation for qualification statements.  This announcement does not create any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this announcement.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government’s evaluation of the information received. ----  Under the design-build acquisition process, a separate Phase One Request for Qualifications will be used to select up to five firms based on qualifications only.  The short listed firms will be requested to submit fully developed technical and price proposals in response to a Phase Two Request for Proposals.  The Government will not allow any stipend for preparation of proposals.  Offerors can be a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility for the project.  A proposed joint venture must provide profiles for all firms in the joint venture for consideration. --- Project Scope:  The proposed project is a new office building of approximately 27,000 gross square feet to house laboratory, support services and administrative functions.   The building footprint limitation will probably require a three story structure to provide the required space. The building exterior must be architecturally compatible with other campus structures.  The work will include demolition of several existing buildings, including the existing building on the proposed construction site, and design and construction of the new facility based on a schematic level description of requirements.  The demolition will involve hazardous material disposal.  The budget for demolition, design and construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Occupancy is planned for mid 2007. ---- Please send responses to Dale Burson at dale.burson@des.ihs.gov by April 30, 2005.  Include a brief description of your firm’s capabilities and experience in design-build projects.  If your firm is not registered in the Central Contractor Registration database, please register at www.ccr.gov.  If already registered, please verify that your information is current.

<SUBJECT>R -- Anti Methamphetamine Campaign
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with the Partnership of Drug Free America (PDFA) for the acquisition of the development of an Anti-Methamphetamine Program.  The Government intends to award a contract for twelve months.    

Nature and Description of Action: 
The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in conjunction with the Partnership for a Drug Free America has a Congressional Mandate to operate the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.  A new dimension to the Campaign is the requirement to develop advertisements which specifically address methamphetamines.  
The Contractor shall help increase the knowledge of parents and opinion-leaders that methamphetamine is harmful to children and adolescents, and results in serious negative consequences for individuals and communities.  The Contractor shall increase the interest and ability of individuals and their communities to take effective action to protect their youth from methamphetamines.

The Contractor shall:  
1)	Develop a communications strategy, based upon their substantial expertise on drug issues, including knowledge and attitudes of parents and teens, and effective drug demand reduction strategies, to plan and implement a high impact public service advertising campaign designed to convey the harm from methamphetamines to children and adolescents, and to drive individuals and communities to take action to reduce the problem.
2)	Utilizing their significant experience in recruiting top-flight ad agencies to produce PRO BONO public service advertising on drug issues, the Contractor shall recruit and brief a PRO BONO advertising agency to create and produce the public service advertising, based on the communications strategy.  Produce the advertising in a timely manner at reasonable costs, following the Partnership model, utilizing all the resources necessary to complete the production.  Test the advertising to assure that all messages will be clear, credible, and impactful, with minimal possibility of ineffective or counter-productive results from the advertising.
3)	Conduct media outreach to showcase the advertising and gain attention to the campaign through the news media, and collaborate with ONDCP and other government agencies and non-profit organizations that can assist in the effective dissemination of advertising messages and materials.
4)	Utilize access to their previously established national and local network of individuals and organizations with experience in regional drug issues to distribute the advertising to media outlets, and secure maximum amounts of donated advertising time and space, with particular focus on those areas of the country that suffer disproportionately from problems with methamphetamines.

5)	Provide tested and finished ads for airing in July and August 2005, as this time provides a window of opportunity for media exposure relating to this topic.
6)	Provide a report on the placement of the advertising, including a valuation of  PRO BONO creative and donated media time and space

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 15 days after publication of this notice.    Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.     If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to the Partnership of Drug Free America (PDFA).

Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to Lisa Wells at ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov   Or, responses may be addressed to Lisa Wells, Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street, UNB 4th Floor, Parkersburg, WV  26101.

<SUBJECT>A -- Industry Day Announcement for the BattleAxe Program
<DESC>Industry Day Announcement for the BattleAxe Program on 12 Apr 05 at Eglin AFB FL.  AFRL/MNMI’s BattleAxe Program Manager intends to host an Industry Day at Bldg 13, Eglin AFB, FL on 12 Apr 05.  This meeting will review advancements made to date in developing reactive materials by the HERD facility, design experimentations of Shaped Charge Jet (SCJ) liners by the Advanced Warheads Experimentation Facility (AWEF), and the schedule, objectives, and funding of the BattleAxe Program.  “One-on-one” meetings between individual contractors and the Government for follow up discussions concerning the Industry Day agenda may also be scheduled for 12 Apr 05 or shortly thereafter.  All arrangements, appointments, etc., including completion and submittal of a MAX worksheet (see Attachment) for on-base access, must be made with Lt Jonathan Foster no later than 6 Apr 05.  Contact Lt Foster at jonathan.foster@eglin.af.mil, Phone (850) 882-2141 ext 2212, and fax 850-882-9790 for additional information.
Background:  AFRL/MN has been investigating Advanced Energetics for the past year.  An enhanced blast impulse has been demonstrated over Insensitive Munition (IM) compliant explosives utilizing an advanced energetic reactive material.  Additionally, the High Explosive Research and Development (HERD) facility, cooperatively with industry and other DoD and DoE laboratories, has been developing advanced energetic reactive fragments to defeat soft targets.  This program will ascertain the advantage and disadvantages of various reactive materials via modeling analysis and testing and will incorporate the best material into the three kill mechanisms:  blast, fragmentation, and a shaped charge jet.   
Program Objective:  The objective of the BattleAxe Program is to develop, fabricate, and demonstrate a small, roughly 20-pound, ordnance package that will provide greater kill capability over a broad spectrum of targets than a conventional ordnance package of the same size.  The BattleAxe warhead is expected to consist of three kill mechanisms:  blast, fragmentation, and a shaped charge jet.  These three defeat mechanisms must be seamlessly integrated into a functioning ordnance package.  The addition of the chemical energy release of reactive materials will be assessed to enhance the kill capability of the ordnance package.  The final integrated solution will be tested against national range targets and additional lethality of reactive materials quantified. 
Envisioned Phases/Contract Awards:  BattleAxe is envisioned to have four phases.  Phase One work is to begin and finish in FY06.  Award of two Task Order (IDIQ) contracts is envisioned for demonstration of “point of departure” warhead designs in this phase.  After Phase I, it is expected that subsequent phases will be awarded to a single contractor.  Phase Two work is to begin at the end FY06 and run through FY07.  This phase will optimize a design from Phase One to a target set and will be tested against a simulated target.  Phase Three work is to begin at the end of FY07 and end in FY08.  This phase will spiral new technology into warhead design, refine modeling and simulation work to date, and demonstrate a new design against a range target.  Phase Four work is to begin at the end of FY08 and run through FY09.  This phase will spiral in new technology, test a new design against soft mobile target, and validate modeling and simulation work to date.

Industry is hereby formally Requested to provide a Price Quote on their market costs to accommodate staffing all of the positions and functional work as stated in the SOW for the above listed positions that shall be calculated at 2080 fully burdened labor hours showing your equivalent labor categories, labor rates used, applying all fringe and other benefits, and all back up data to show how calculated and your industry total quote or price for these 32 FTE positions. All pricing quotes with all back up documentation as requested shall be delivered no later than May 2, 2005 to the Contracting officer indicated herein. The SOW is posted under a separate announcement notice to this notice. The purpose of this Streamlined Non-MEO A-76 study is to determine whether it is cheaper for industry or the Government to continue to perform the operation as-is, as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity. The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities (CA) functions under several methods to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources. The method chosen by the Department of Labor for Administrative Support is a Streamlined Non-MEO study.  Reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76. This synopsis serves to publish not only the official start date in FEDBIZOPPS at www.eps.gov., but to provide essential information about the study and to seek industry quotes on this current AS-IS effort.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Patrick Pizzella, the Agency Tender Official is Mr. Dennis Sprouse, the Contracting Officer/SSA is Mr. Peter Higginbotham, the PWS Team Leader is Ms. Sareen Gerson, and the HRA is Mr. Douglas Goodell. Note for industry: this will be the only announcement.  There will be NO Formal RFQ issued under the non-MEO streamlined process.  You are requested to provide best supportable market cost or market pricing on the exact positions geographically disbursed throughout the United States, ensuring you meet all statutory and other Service Contract Act requirements.  Industry quotes must be delivered and received by mail No Later Than May 2, 2005, in the hands of the Contracting Officer for the Office of Competitive Sourcing at the location described herein.  Your market quotes must be fully documented and supported in the following manner:  Provide a hard copy cover letter, and include a CD ROM that contains your pricing quote listing each position FTE Position (by equivalent industry category) by geographical location, priced out at 2080 paid hours, including all required fringe and legal benefits as FT on an Excel Spreadsheet.  Certify and support your claim that in 30 days your firm would be able to have all required personnel in place and fully trained and ready to take over the Administrative Support functions at these locations using all Government provided software, equipment and facilities, and indicate that you would be able to obtain bonding, if required. The cost comparison process as follows:  In accordance with the A76 Circular, and Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Contracting Officer will analyze market  pricing or quote received against the Government’s As-Is estimate to perform the function at the As-Is staffing level and make a final decision.  If it appears that market pricing or quotes are properly supported, showing substantive proof that the quoted pricing is more cost effective than the government’s, a decision may be made to issue a formal RFP and ultimately go contract, as a formal cost proposal is not currently being sought from industry.  If the government as-is organization estimate is more cost effective a decision shall be rendered to retain the function in-house. This will be the only announcement made for this effort.  Any comments should be directed solely to the Director of Competitive Sourcing, Mr. Larry Clark at Clark.Larry@dol.gov.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Sybase Upgrade for FSS CIO
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source task order award under FSS Schedule 70 to Sybase, Incorporated  under the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 USC 501).

The Federal Acquisition Regulation basis is cited in FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1), “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- (a)(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.."

In February 2000 a competitive procurement was awarded for the Customization and Personalization of the GSA Advantage system.  Sybase was the one of the competitive solutions considered and recommended by the technical evaluation team.   It was also considered the reasonable and acceptable solution based on price.

Therefore, on the basis of the best value determination, CIO established Sybase as the standard database management software for the GSA Advantage system.  As a result, Sybase has been implemented as the primary database environment to develop and run other mission critical business applications.  Application software developed with Sybase software will not operate with database software from any other manufacturer without significant conversion effort.  Existing applications are the product of, literally, thousands of person-hours of design, coding, and testing efforts over the span of more than 20 years, and are not available “off the shelf.”  Existing staff is trained in the management and support of Sybase software.  

General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Service (FSS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) owns and operates 90 Sun server systems, which are housed in two different sites within the United States.  These systems support key GSA applications, including www.gsaadvantage.gov and are central to GSA’s mission.  The database management platform is based on Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). 

Application software developed with Sybase stored procedures and data types will not operate with database software from any other manufacturer without significant conversion effort.  Existing applications are the product of, literally, thousands of person-hours of design, coding, and testing efforts over the span of more than 20 years, and are not available “off the shelf.”  Existing staff is trained in the management and support of Sybase software.  

Therefore, the General Services Administration Federal Supply Service intends to purchase from Sybase, Incorporated, the required software upgrades pursuant Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Part 6.302-1.

1.1. BACKGROUND.  In order to achieve long-term peace and stability in the Middle East, the youth need to be reached.  One effective means of influencing youth is through the use of comic books.

2.4.  The series will be based on the security forces, military and police, in the near future in the Middle East in cooperation with the Ministries of Interior of some of those countries.

(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  

(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Evaluation Information:  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government on the basis of (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance and (3) PRICE, as explained below.  Technical.  The Government will assess the technical capability of each offeror on the following areas.   The Government will NOT assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.
a.  Approach to performance/completion of the Comic Books, to include time lines and discussions on the individuals or group that will be working on the effort.     

b.  2 Samples of previous work.

c.  Special Benefits.  Discuss the company’s special benefits/resources that add value to their proposal.    

3.  Past Performance.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe:  (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.  The Government will not evaluate an offeror's organizational past performance on the basis of the personal past performance of the offeror's key personnel.  The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.

4.  Price.  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability.  Price will be evaluated on the basis of price analysis if adequate competition is obtained.

5.    Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors.  Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government considers an offeror's Technical Capability to be more important than Past Performance or  Price.  The elements of Technical are in descending order of importance.  However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection will depend on the differences among the competing offerors.  See Source Selection Decision, below.

6.   Source Selection Decision.  In order to select the winning offeror, the Government will rank the offerors from best to worst.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection authority will decide whether the difference in capability is worth the difference in price.  If the source selection authority considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.  The Source Selection Authority will continue to make paired comparisons until he or she has decided which offeror represents the best value.
(x) Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.  
(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

S. COAST GUARD HU-25 AUXILIARY POWER UNIT REPAIR, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

1.0	BACKGROUND:

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault Aviation, previously, Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.   The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) model GTCP36-100C is a gas turbine engine, which is essentially a self-contained power source providing pneumatic and rotational shaft power.   The APU provides AC/DC electrical power for the HU-25 aircraft systems prior to engine start or during selected emergency procedures.  It also provides a pneumatic source for the operation of environmental systems during ground operations.  APU’s and their subcomponents are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  History has shown the APU to be highly reliable, with the exception of internal oil seals leaking oil in to the gas path.  Otherwise, little more is required than scheduled maintenance and inspections.  The APU requires Major Periodic Inspection (MPI) following: 2700 airframe operating hours, Foreign Object Damage (FOD), internal oil leaks, or mechanical failure beyond the scope of normal line maintenance.





2.0	OBJECTIVE:

                    will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level
                    agreements.
     
2.2.	  To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following

The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.

Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed-price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the                     Contract, by written modification.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

THE COAST GUARD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO PERFORM A SITE SURVEY OF THE CONTRACTOR’S AND SUB-CONTRACTOR’S CAPABILITIES.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  

52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan 2004)
 
52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

·	         The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard
               merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business 
               judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s 
               relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 – Technical/Management Solution/Approach
                       Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
                       Factor 3 – Past Performance
                       Factor 4 – Cost/Price

	         Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While
               the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price 
               Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

               Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
               factors approach equal.

               Enclosure: (1) Detailed Factors




Enclosure (1)
DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Offeror’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of auxiliary power unit (APU) and component part refurbishment (repair).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Offeror has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Offeror’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document.

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.


Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Offeror’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Offeror’s actual performance on repair of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation or proposed price/cost.  Offeror’s quote shall include a firm-fixed-price for each of the one-year ordering periods contained in the 3-year base and the 2-year option.  

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.  The price proposal should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Next Generation High-Speed Rail Program is a key element in the U.S. Department of Transportation's overall effort to promote high-speed rail passenger transportation in the United States, particularly in selected congested inter-urban corridors.  The program support the advancement of high-speed rail, particularly on existing infrastructure, by improving, adapting, and demonstrating potentially more cost-effective technologies which could have wide application in U.S. corridors.

Technologies most likely to help facilitate the deployment of high-speed rail service are those which will (1) bring about cost reductions in constructing and maintaining equipment, track, and facilities; (2) reduce operating costs by providing more efficient operations; (3) improve the reliability of equipment and infrastructure components by resucing failures and/or reducing false failure detections; (4) improve safety by reducing human and technology failures; (5) enhance revenue-generating capability by attracting greater ridership through reducing trip times, upgrading customer service quality, increasing reliability, or improving on-time performance and/or (6) enhance the social benefits and/or environmental aspects of high-speed rail.  This is an unrestricted solicitation for which private industries, state and local governments, and universities may submit proposals in response to the BAA solicitation.  

The complete BAA 2005-1 package may be downloaded or printed from the following Internet address:  http://www.fra.gov, and then through the choices of "Passenger Rail" (from upper left home page menu), "Financial Assistance" (on the drop down menu), "Funding for High Speed Rail" (center of Financial Assistance page), "Rail Demonstration Funding Opportunities", "Broad Agency Announcement."

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to post Contractors questions received for this solicitation and the Governments response.

Question 1: Why would a Masters/MBA or PhD with 20+ years of DOD and formalized Data Analysis expertise without a CDFM, not also qualify?

Answer:   CDFM Certification for the instructor is required.  One of the objectives of the training is to prepare the budget analysts for the CDFM exam.  CDFM certification is assurance the instructor has maintained and enhanced their professional proficiency in Defense financial management.  An instructor with CDFM certification will have the level of expertise to prepare the analysts for the CDFM exam.
 
Question 2.  Why does this a small-business set aside also require CEUs....not many small businesses are qualified to give CEUs.  We are a MAJOR provider of customized training for DOD and civilian federal agencies, to include US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, Pentagon, DLA, DISA, US Army Leadership Academy, etc. We do provide Certificates of Completion, though.  Will that qualify?

Answer:  The contractor will provide a Certification of Completion.  The Government, not the Contractor, will determine the CEUs, Continuing Education Units.

          part(s) or subassembly(ies) and replacement with unserviceable part(s)or     
          subassembly(ies).  Any detail part(s) or subassembly(ies) which are suspect of 
          cannibalization will show damage inconsistent with remaining detail parts of a 
          component.  
          
          Corrosion:  Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and  
          are subject to corrosion.  The contractor is advised to expect corrosion on  
          equipment to be repaired/overhauled under this requirement.  During a 
          repair/overhaul, the presence of corrosion in an assembly or component thereof 
          shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection.  Should 
          corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to 
          remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected.  Corroded parts shall be replaced 
          except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair 
          efficiency or safe operation of the part.  Corrosion removal and treatment of 
          affected areas shall be accomplished IAW OEM’s current specifications, 
          drawings, and Component  Maintenance Manual (CMM), or shall meet the  
          Contracting Officer’s approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not 
          clear.  The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the 
          firm-fixed repair/overhaul price.
	
          Unusual Damage:  Damage resulting from customer negligence in use or         
          maintenance, acts of God, war, accident, foreign object damage (not domestic 
          object damage), and crash damage.  
         
4.	Add Service Bulletin GTCP36-49-6149 to paragraph 3.0 Applicable Documents.
          Concerned with the internal oil leak associated with this APU (see paragraph 1.0 
           Background), this bulletin may be a viable option to consider to repair/overhaul 
          the unit.  All terms and conditions involving Service Bulletins still apply in 
          paragraph 4.0 Service Bulletins.  
  
5.	The following page was inadvertently missing from the original solicitation:  

                                                                 	       Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 002 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 2-BAND OPTICAL PYROMETER TEMPERATURE SENSORS.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions:  QUESTION 1: Subject RFQ includes the term "(turnkey operation)" in the description of the item wanted.  This term comes immediately after the words "right angle mounting".  Please explain what  "turnkey operation" means relative to the hardware requested.  ANSWER 1: The term "turnkey operation" is meant to indicate that the 2-Band optical pyrometer temperature sensors comes with a sensor unit and appropriate cable so that it can be setup without additional needed equipment.  In addition, the pyrometer also provides a visual readout of the temperature with input controls so that it does not have to be used in conjunction with a computer. QUESTION 2:  The weight requirement is stated as of "under 4 pounds".  The weight of the pyrometer is 3.1 lbs, however the additional combined weight of the universal adapter, the interconnecting cable assembly, and the right angle mount will exceed this 4 pound amount.  Is this acceptable?  ANSWER 2:  The 4 lbs refers to the senor head only, not the cables or other pieces. The due date for receipt of offers is not. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 1, 2005.

<DESC>The combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, W914NS-40-Q-0164 for UIC Railroad Turnout Styles 1:11 and 1:13 is amended to include the following paragraph:

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  The technical quote will be more significant then the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.  Offerors shall also discuss how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
