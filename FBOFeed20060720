<DESC>The Dinosaur NM Shuttle services, per contract, provides visitor transportation from the lower visitor center to the Quarry visitor center (VC).  As of 07/11/2006, the Quarry VC was closed for structural repairs.  Due to this closure, the need for shuttle services to the Quarry VC is no longer needed.  However, it is the Park's desire to continue shuttle services within the park, to an alternate destination, for continued park visitor services, until the end of current summer season. The current contractor has requested and been granted the authority, to run the alternate route on a temporary basis, at a no cost change, until completion of summer season, unless a more advantageous short-duration timeframe proposal and any new award is made.  It is anticipated that a new shuttle services solicitation for a full season to this alternate route may be advertised by January 2007.   Currently, the shuttle service to the Quarry VC comprises approximately 36 one mile round trips per day.  The  alternate route travels an equal total distance, made up of a nine mile round trip to the Green River campground, four times per day.  These services are ongoing.  If a new contract is awarded, quick mobilization would be required.  Services would be required from the date of any award through September 4. An anticipated award date is approximated for mid to late August. This Announcement is being advertised in an effort to determine the level of interest in this project.  Any vendor that would be interested in providing the required shuttle services for the approximate 2 to 3 week period should contact Joseph R. Gatlin at joseph_gatlin@nps.gov or303-969-2660or John Norway at john_norway@nps.gov or 303-969-2272, no later than 4 pm MST, Thursday July 27, 2006.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with North Carolina State University, 240  Admin. Serv. III, 2701 Sullivan Drive, Raleigh, North Carolina for Fishery indices for the Southeast Atlantic (FISEA):  Biological indicators of coastal and estuary-dependent fishery production in the U.S. South Atlantic.  There are four objectives that will guide this project:  1. Test for synchronous patterns and relationships in long-term data series of larval ingress and juvenile abundance for a suite of species in the U.S. South Atlantic and North Carolina.  2.  Evaluate interrelationships between measures of larval ingress, juvenile abundance, and adult stock dynamics for individual species and guilds of species that use NC estuaries as nurseries.  3.  Evaluate the contribution from physical and meteorological forces that may couple or uncouple the above life-stage relationships.  4.  Generate biological (year-class strength indicies for species) and climate (synoptic- and local-scale meteorology) indicators using the larval ingress metrics.  The report is to be delivered F.O.B. Destination to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, CCFHR Beaufort Laboratory, 101 Pivers Island Road, Beaufort, North Carolina 28516.  The period of performance is August 15 2006, or date of award, whichever is later, through September 14, 2007, with an option for an additional year of performance.  In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1).  The FSC for this is B516 and the NAICS Code is 541990, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  North Carolina State University (NCSU) is the only known source capable of performing the required documentation.  NCSU provided the competitively-funded NOAA FATE proposal:  “Fishery indices for the Southeast Atlantic (FISEA):  Biological indicators of coastal and estuary-dependent fishery production in the U.S. South Atlantic”.  It is critical to maintain continuity of the dataset.  Scientists at NCSU have acquired all relevant data available from other agencies, such as the NC Division of Marine Fisheries.  Significant effort has already been devoted to extracting pertinent records and performing necessary quality assurance and control procedures on the non-federal datasets.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. August 8, 2006 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required analysis.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is 334515, Size Standard 500 employees. Solicitation/Purchase Request number F2BDDL6195B001 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Government intends to award a purchase order for the following line items to Beel Technologies Inc., St Bruno, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, through the Canadian Commercial Corporation, Ottawa, Ontario:  CLIN 0001:  Dual Channel Mode 3/A C Far Field Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) Monitor with automatic switchover, Part Number 32105/000, quantity 2 each; CLIN 0002:  Solar Power Source (3 panels, 510 watts, 200 AHr Battery storage, aluminum enclosure), Part Number 45-795-01, quantity 2 each; CLIN 0003:  Outdoor enclosure with transport handles, Part Number 45-494-01, quantity 2 each.  FOB: Destination (McGuire Air Force Base NJ and Tinker Air Force Base OK ). Inspection and Acceptance:  Origin.  Delivery required on or before 01 February 2007. This requirement is determined to be available only from Beel Technologies Inc.  Justification:  The AN/MPR-26 Radar Surveillance Central has an Identification Fiend or FOE system that operates independently of the Primary Radar Antenna.  This system requires a RSSRM (Remote Secondary Surveillance Radar Monitor) to serve as a test target for the SSR.  The RSSRM serves as an independent means of verifying SSR integrity. Additionally, the equipment must be capable of being sited in areas that have no infrastructure, whether on an established AF Base or deployed airfield, since the RSSRM supports mobile radar operations.  Because of this requirement, it needs to have an outdoor enclosure and solar power source.  Beel Technologies Inc with the Model 32105 is the only R22RM manufacturer who satisfies these requirements (Dual Channel operation; automatic switchover, operation in modes 3/A and C, solid state, built-in test and fault reporting, directional antenna, integral 50 DB attenuator, outdoor enclosure and solar panels).

Eligible firms will be invited to bid on a contract to provide, install, test and integrate four Radomes, plus two options, located on tower, for the air defense radars placed in

The value of the basic project (four Radomes) is estimated at 3.3 million EUR ($4.0 million USD).  

The NATO reference that will be used to identify the documents related to this project is 5WI20101-6 and any documents concerning the subsequent bidding process will include this number for reference purposes. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-5WI20101-6.

The Radome to relocate is similar to the one described above, but installed on the ground, not on the tower.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 27 September 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: 4th quarter 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: 1st quarter 2007

4. Anticipated contract award date: 2nd quarter 2007

5. Tentative period of work: 2nd quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2010

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates award of an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) to provide anticorruption services for the Office of Democracy and Governance in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).   The purpose of this contract is to provide USAID and its partner countries with the broad range of technical assistance necessary to develop and implement appropriate and meaningful strategies to fight corruption and ensure accountability in public life.  USAID defines corruption as “the abuse of entrusted authority for private gain.”  This activity focuses on unilateral abuses by governmental officials such as embezzlement and nepotism, as well as abuses linking public and private actors such as bribery, extortion, influence peddling, and fraud, and at both lower and higher levels of government and the public sector (i.e., both “administrative” and “grand” corruption).  The activities to support the strategic approaches to fighting corruption under this contract are expected to encompass the following functional areas: (a) public financial, administrative and regulatory measures that promote transparency and accountability; (b) civil society advocacy on behalf of governmental integrity; and (c) incorporation of anti-corruption promotion into other sectoral/sub-sectoral areas, such as health and education, corporate governance, or into key aspects of democracy promotion, such as rule of law, legislative oversight or local government strengthening.  In addition, the Contractor shall award and administer, upon task order request, a small grants program to support indigenous nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in pilot or experimental activities as well as provide institutional strengthening support, as appropriate, to the recipient NGOs.  USAID estimates awarding five (5) contracts as a result of this solicitation, including 4 unrestricted and one small business set-aside.  USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $750,000,000 over the five (5) year ordering period.  Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached.  There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of task orders that any one firm will receive, or the amount of money each firm is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount stated in the RFP. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990.  The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.     In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.  Questions must be directed to Ms. Ryan Johnson, Contracting Officer, U.S. Agency for International Development, M/OAA/DCHA/DOFDA, Ronald Reagan Building, Room 7.09-146, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, D.C. 20523, (Phone: 202-712-1185) (Fax: 202-216-3132) (email: ryjohnson@usaid.gov).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA 93042-5001 plans to use a Firm Fixed Price contract to procure on an other than full and open competition basis from EaglePicher Technologies, LLC, 120 Flight Termination System Thermal Batteries EAP 12194 in support of the HARM Missile. Contract award is estimated to be 1 October 2006.  The Thermal Batteries EAP 12194 were procured as part of the Flight Termination System, FTS, and provide the redundant power source for the HARM FTS. All FTS are governed by Range Safety's Document RCC 319 and each component must be qualified.  The EAP 12194 thermal batteries have been inspected, tested and subjected to the missile environment including temperature, acceleration, vibration and shock.  The EAP 12914 has also been qualified and approved by Range Safety for the HARM FTS.  Development and qualification of FTS components would require, but are not limited to, development cost, qualification costs, documentation c!  osts, and range safety review and approval costs.  Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.  EaglePicher is the only source with the qualified and approved Thermal Batteries EAP 12194.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Send responses to Commander Code 254300E, ATTN Lenette Santana, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 575 I Ave Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA 93042-5049 by 17 August 2006.

<DESC>This is a reiteration of the synopsis that was issued on May 09, 2006 under DRAFT Solicitation NNK06146635J and a reiteration of the synopsis that was issued on February 16, 2006 under Reference Number 02-16-06 for Multiple Award IDIQ General Construction contracts to be awarded by NASA's Kennedy Space Center.  NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plans to issue a request for proposals resulting in the award of multiple Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) general construction contracts to support construction, alteration, and repair of NASA buildings, structures, and other real property located at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and other locations near KSC and CCAFS. These multiple general construction contracts will provide NASA/KSC the capability to compete selected quick turn-around construction projects amongst a group of highly qualified general construction contractors for a five year period. Selection of this group of general construction contractors will be based on best value trade-offs between relevant experience/past performance and price factors with relevant experience/past performance being significantly more important than price.  Each IDIQ contract will have a minimum value of $10,000 which represents the minimum value of work the Government is required to order under each IDIQ contract. The maximum contract value of each IDIQ contract and the maximum value of all IDIQ contracts will be $400 million.  The acquisition process will include the issuance of a DRAFT request for proposal (RFP) inviting comments from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRAFT RFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches. The anticipated release date of the DRAFT RFP is not earlier than March 03, 2006.  The RFP will include specifications and drawings for a task order envisioned to be awarded to one of the selected IDIQ contractors. The task order will be representative in nature of the tasks to be ordered under the proposed IDIQ general construction contracts. Offerors will be required to submit a price proposal for the task order as part of its proposal for the IDIQ contracts. Offerors will be provided a tour of the site where the model task order will be performed.  Future task orders will be competed amongst all of the general construction IDIQ contractors unless one of the statutory exceptions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b) (2) applies. The task order placement process will provide primarily for a “sealed bid” type process where low price wins; however, the task ordering procedures will allow the contracting officer to consider past performance on earlier orders under the contract (including quality and timeliness), past performance on other relevant and recent projects, potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor, and minimum order requirements when making task order award. The performance periods for task orders will vary depending on the scope, urgency of the project, and other applicable factors as determined during the design phase of the projects. The specific projects to be ordered will be detailed in construction drawings and specifications (unless a design-build project is contemplated in which case a statement of work will be provided) as attachments to task order solicitations.  This acquisition will be conducted under full and open competition procedures allowing maximum participation from large and small businesses. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220 and the small business size standard is $31 million.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  The DRAFT and FINAL solicitations and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the DRAFT and FINAL solicitations and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Any referenced notes may be viewed at the URLs linked below.  All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing. Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>66 -- INTEGRATING NEPHELOMETER & CONDENSATION PARTICLE COUNTER
<SOLNBR>NRMJ1060126KAR
<RESPDATE>080806
<ARCHDATE>08102006
<CONTACT>Kelly Rima, Purchasing Agent, Phone 303-497-3779, Fax 303-497-3163, Email Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with TSI Incorporated for an integrating nephelometer and condensation particle counter.  The following critical specifications are required:  
SPECIFICATIONS FOR NEPHELOMETER
1.	WAVELENGTHS:  Continuous operation at three wavelengths, centered at 450, 550, and 700 nm is required. Optical filter band pass shall be less than 40 nm at full width, half maximum (FWHM). The wavelength controlling filters shall be mounted such that they can be easily removed for checking their transmission characteristics or replacing with a different wavelength. The overall wavelength response shall be measured, not just based on a composite of manufacturer's specifications.
2.	ANGULAR INTEGRATION:  Continuous operation in two angular integration ranges is required. As a minimum, the total scatter channel shall cover angles of 7 degrees to 170 degrees. The back scatter channel shall cover angles of 90 degrees to 170 degrees.
3.	SENSITIVITY:  Aerosol scattering and hemispheric backscattering coefficient at 60 second averaging time of 0.5 inverse mega meters (5E 7 inverse meters) at all wavelengths. Sensitivity is defined as two times the standard deviation of the measured value when sampling filtered, particle free air.
4.	BACKGROUND DRIFT:  The drift in the instrument's background signal, as determined when measuring filtered air at one hour intervals, shall be less than 0.1 inverse mega meters (equivalent signal, all six channels).
5.	OPTICAL BACKGROUND:  The non Rayleigh optical background shall be less than 5 inverse mega meters (equivalent signal, all three total scattering channels).
6.	AIR CHOPPER:  Shall allow total particle filter to be switched automatically into sample air stream at operator selected intervals for operator selected duration, to allow measurement of the instrument's background signal.
7.	REFERENCE CHOPPER:  Shall allow measurement of light intensity of a reference object illuminated by main lamp, as well as measurement of photo detector’s dark signal.
8.	RESPONSE TIME:  Sensors, measuring chamber and air pathways shall be designed to ensure a system response time of less than 5 sec. The response time is defined as the time for the signal to change by 63 percent of the total change in response to a step change in scattering coefficient, e.g., when a filter is switched into the incoming air stream.
9.	PARTICLE TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS:  Losses of unit density particles in the size range 0.05 to 5 micrometer diameter shall be less than 5 percent when operated at a flow rate that provides the required response time as defined above.
10.	TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE SENSORS:  Shall be built into the nephelometer to allow continuous corrections for changes in Rayleigh scattering coefficient of air within the sample volume. The calibration curves for the temperature and pressure sensors shall be alterable via the RS232C serial port.
11.	RELATIVE HUMIDITY SENSOR:  Shall be built into the nephelometer to provide a continuous record of the relative humidity inside the sampling chamber. The calibration curve for the relative humidity sensor shall be alterable via the RS232C serial port.
12.	CALIBRATION:  The following two calibration schemes shall be supported. The first shall use filtered air as the downscale calibration point and carbon dioxide as the upscale calibration point. The second scheme shall use helium or a vacuum as the downscale calibration point and filtered air as the upscale calibration point.
13.	AVERAGING TIME:  Shall be selectable from 1 to 3600 seconds via serial port.
14.	VACUUM INTEGRITY:  The optical unit shall be vacuum tight, determined as follows. The time for the pressure in the sealed sampling chamber to rise from 100 hPa below ambient pressure to 90 hPa below ambient pressure shall be at least 1 hour when the ambient pressure is 1000 hPa. The minimum time varies as the reciprocal of the ambient pressure if the test is conducted at other pressures.
15.	OUTPUTS:  Digital (RS232C) output shall be provided. The RS232C serial output shall include instrument status, temperature, pressure and light scattering coefficient (total and backscatter channels, three wavelengths each). Additional details of the RS232C interface protocol are supplied below.
16.	INSTRUMENT SETUP AND CONTROL:  Shall be accomplished from the front panel of the instrument or through the RS-232C serial port. Setup and calibration parameters shall be stored in non volatile memory so that they are retained when the instrument is turned off.
17.	POWER SUPPLY:  The nephelometer shall be capable of running on +28VDC, 120VAC at 60Hz, or 240VAC at 50Hz.
18.	ENVIRONMENTAL:  The nephelometer shall operate according to the preceeding requirements in the following environments: Room temperature range 10 to 40 degrees C, room pressure 100 to 1100 hPa, room air relative humidity non condensing, sample air relative humidity 0 to 95 percent.
User and RS232C interface (Nephelometer):
1.	The user interface shall be designed so that any command can be entered from the RS232C serial port. This requires that front panel switches, if any, shall send commands that change the operating state, rather than set the state of the instrument. Since front panel switch positions do not indicate the operating state of the instrument, another means of providing a visual indication of operating state shall be provided (LED's, or perhaps the main display) if the instrument uses front panel switches to change the operating state.
2.	Commands issued to the nephelometer via the serial port shall follow a simple protocol: a short command identifier (2 to 3 letters), a numeric parameter (if needed by the command), and a carriage return to terminate the command. The instrument shall accept commands at any time and shall acknowledge command receipt with a short message (e.g., "OK" or "Invalid command "or "Invalid parameter").
3.	Three types of reports shall be transmittable by the nephelometer, in either a polled or unpolled mode (user selectable). In unpolled mode, data reports and status reports shall be sent at the end of a user specified time period (default value is the same as the instrument averaging time) or whenever the operating state of the instrument changes. In polled mode, reports shall only be sent in response to a specific command issued by the user.
4.	Reports shall consist of printable ASCII characters, with the various parameter fields separated by commas or blank spaces. A status field shall indicate the position of the zero air valve and the current operating state (purge, count ambient, count background). When the instrument is counting ambient air, then the data values shall be the ambient light scattering coefficients. When the instrument is counting background, the data values shall be the background "scattering coefficients". Each report shall be terminated by a carriage return and line feed pair of characters. 
5.	Data reports shall consist of the measured values of aerosol scattering coefficient and aerosol hemispheric backscattering coefficient for each wavelength, plus the temperature, pressure and relative humidity in the sampling volume. All values shall be output in SI units.
6.	Status reports shall be transmitted in response to a user command, and shall include the current values of all parameters which define the operating state of the instrument. Critical status information shall be included in the status field of data reports.
SPECIFICATIONS FOR CPC
1.	OPERATING MODE:  The instrument shall provide a continuous measurement of the particle number concentration.
2.	DETECTION LIMIT (PARTICLE SIZE):  The instrument shall have a counting efficiency of at least 50 percent for 10 nm diameter particles, and at least 85 percent for 20 nm diameter particles.
3.	DETECTION LIMIT (PARTICLE NUMBER CONCENTRATION):  Single particle counting is required.  False background counts, when the instrument is sampling filtered air, shall be less than 1 particle per 100 seconds.
4.	WORKING FLUID:  Water.  The CPC shall have a liquid level sensor that initiates automatic filling from an external bottle, when needed.
5.	RESPONSE TIME:  Sensors, measuring chamber and air pathways shall be designed to ensure a system response time of less than 2 sec. The response time is defined as the time for the signal to change by 63 percent of the total change in response to a step change in particle number concentration, e.g., when a filter is switched into the incoming air stream.
6.	OUTPUTS:  Digital (RS232C) output shall be provided. The RS232C serial output shall include instrument status, operating temperatures, and particle number concentration. Additional details of the RS232C interface protocol are supplied below.
7.	INSTRUMENT SETUP AND CONTROL:  Shall be accomplished from the front panel of the instrument or through the RS232C serial port. Setup and calibration parameters shall be stored in non volatile memory so that they are retained when the instrument is turned off.
8.	POWER SUPPLY:  The CPC shall be capable of running on 120VAC at 60Hz, or 240VAC at 50Hz.
9.	ENVIRONMENTAL:  The CPC shall operate according to the preceding requirements in the following environments: Room temperature range 10 to 40 degrees C, room pressure 500 to 1100 hPa, room air relative humidity non condensing, sample air relative humidity 0 to 95 percent.
User and RS232C interface (CPC):
1.	The user interface shall be designed so that any command can be entered from the RS232C serial port. This requires that front panel switches, if any, shall send commands that change the operating state, rather than set the state of the instrument. Since front panel switch positions do not indicate the operating state of the instrument, another means of providing a visual indication of operating state shall be provided (LED's, or perhaps the main display) if the instrument uses front panel switches to change the operating state.
2.	Commands issued to the CPC via the serial port shall follow a simple protocol: a short command identifier (2 to 3 letters), a numeric parameter (if needed by the command), and a carriage return to terminate the command. The instrument shall accept commands at any time and shall acknowledge command receipt with a short message (e.g., "OK" or "Invalid command "or "Invalid parameter").
3.	Data reports shall be transmittable by the CPC, in either a polled or unpolled mode (user selectable). In unpolled mode, data reports and status reports shall be sent at the end of a user specified time period (default value is the same as the instrument averaging time) or whenever the operating state of the instrument changes. In polled mode, reports shall only be sent in response to a specific command issued by the user.
4.	Reports shall consist of printable ASCII characters, with the various parameter fields separated by commas or blank spaces. A status field shall indicate the current operating state. Each report shall be terminated by a carriage return and/or line feed character. All values shall be output in SI units.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Based on product research and professional knowledge, TSI is the only vendor who can meet our critical specifications.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Anticipated award date will be August 10, 2006.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMPETITIVE SYNOPSIS WITH A SEPARATELY ISSUED SOLICITATION

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services regarding The Review of NCI Thesaurus for OBO-Compliance and Training to Help NCI Achieve Compliance.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541512 and the business size standard is $23M.  

Introduction: The two major terminology products of the Electronic Vocabulary System (EVS) are the NCI Metathesaurus http://ncimeta.nic.nih.gov/ and the NCI Thesaurus http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/.  The tasks in the SOW are focused on the NCI Thesaurus.

NCI Thesaurus is a description logic concept based namespace that contains cancer-centric terminology.  It is primarily intended for use by applications to traverse vocabulary trees and the semantic relationships between and among concepts.  It provides the base semantics for NCI’s metadata infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR) and NCI’s data repository infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caBIO). In addition it is used by NCI to index the NCI’s Web portal site (see http://cancer.gov); by NIH to construct concept vectors used by the NIH knowledge management system; by the cancer Bioinformatics Grid (see http://caBIG.nci.nih.gov) to provide terminology for the various activities; and by numerous scientific applications, across a growing number of domains that increasingly extend beyond cancer.  NCI Thesaurus is published monthly by the NCI under an open content license (see ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/ThesaurusTermsofUse.pdf). 

Scope:  Four (4) general activities are within scope of this SOW.  The first activity is a review and report of OBO criteria and relevant ISO standards for semantic quality and federation of terminologies as well as identifying and defining a set of goal requirements for semantic quality and consistency.  The second is review of the content and semantic structure of a small specified subset of NCI Thesaurus, a biomedical terminology produced by the NCI, for compliance with relevant International Standards Organization (ISO) standards; and for compliance with standards related to qualification as an open terminology under OBO; and for compliance with design and semantics criteria for federation with other OBO terminologies. The third activity includes documenting several clear examples of the modeling that would be needed to achieve compliance; this activity could draw on the work conducted in the second activity.  And the fourth activity includes training several NCI designated Editors or Quality Assurance staff to finish reviewing and editing the NCI Thesaurus for compliance.

Period of Performance:  Anticipated, thirty eight (38) weeks after initial award.  Only one award will be made. 

Solicitation:  Interested parties that wish to receive a copy of the solicitation must do so by the following:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   Request shall include name of the contractor, DUNS number, telephone and fax numbers, point of contact, business size standard, and identify the RFQ number RFQ-NCI-60100-NG on all correspondence.  The deadline of this synopsis is August 2, 2006 at 1 PM EST.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation is August 3, 2006 and the estimated due date is August18, 2006. Request for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to issue a sole source blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to W V Communications, Incorporated of Newbury Park, California to purchase Flight Termination System (FTS) control equipment and FTS transmitter components which will interface with, and be direct replacement parts for previously procured parts and systems.  This equipment was specifically designed to NASA/DFRC's specifications. The FTS equipment to be procured must be electrically identical, form and fit compatible with the existing system design.  These supplies will be provided via a "call order" type arrangement.  Quantity: 1 Lot. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase these items using the authority for other than full and open competition at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

Sole source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently has a one-year project to test technology used in underwater sensors.  NIST utilizes the Robocrane suspension mechanism, which uses (6) six hoists, run in closed-loop servo mode, to manipulate a suspended platform in all 6 degrees of freedom (DOF).  NIST currently owns (1) one hoist needed to attach to the existing Robocrane that has been tested for performance requirements and for compatibility with the NIST control system.  Six (6) more hoists are needed in order for the Robocrane to work as required for the collection of data for the program.   The hoist is customized to NIST’s requirements with four sub components and two electronic interfaces.  The identical equipment is required to ensure 100 percent compatibility and functionality with the existing NIST Robocrane as configured.  Compatibility issues with include: maximum length, width and height to fit between structural members on limited deck space of NIST test boat, required cable speed combined with required pulling force, compatible electronic interfaces with NIST control system hardware and software for motor speed control and position encoder feedback. Applied Power is the only contractor who can provide NIST with these customized hoists, configured in the exact manner as the original.  

No solicitation package will be issued.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by June 27, 2006 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Research Facilities Development and Operations (ORF), intends to negotiate and award to Telvent USA, Inc, a sole source fixed price contract under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for the operation and maintenance of recently replaced sections of the NIH campus’ electrical Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.  Currently, the project to replace the existing system is in the phase of final completion.  It was awarded under the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) GSA Utilities Areawide Contract with Telvent as the primary subcontractor and provider of hardware and software for the system.  As each phase is completed, a corresponding section of the existing system is decommissioned.  Support is required to maintain and operate the sections furnished by Telvent.  These services are currently provided under the contract with PEPCO until the Telvent system installation is complete, and accepted by the government.  A new contract will then be required to maintain and operate the Telvent system for a period of two (2) years.  No other known vendors have the knowledge or legal rights to service the hardware and software utilized to maintain the system as it is proprietary data.  Additionally, no other known vendor’s have the working knowledge and familiarity of the project that is needed to successfully operate and maintain the system.  Therefore, it has been determined that Telvent is the only viable source that can fulfill the government’s requirement.  NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the NIH's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered.     Responses to this posting must be submitted to Ms. Ora Bethea at BetheaO@od.nih.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to Verispan, 800 Township Line Road, Yardley, Pennsylvania  19067-4200 for Independent Data on Retail Unit Prescription Drug Prices to Support the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS).   CMS requires data to support the development of U.S. expenditure estimates for prescription in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.  This is a specific task that requires experience collecting and reporting retail prescription sales and volume by various types of payers.  Verispan has experience in preparing this data in previous years and experience working with the CMS staff using these data.  Whereas other such contractors could provide some degree of usefulness in accomplishing this purchase, the government would be paying for front-end familiarization time, which would increase the total cost of this purchase substantially.  The contractor will provide CMS a file with the number of prescription filled in retail pharmacies, the number of units dispensed, and the dollar volume for each 11-digit NDC associated with the brand and generic formulation of the drugs, distinguishing among the following categories of payers:  (1) cash-paying (2) Medicare Part D, (3) Medicaid, and (4) other third parties.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  In-vivo EPR Mobile Scanner for Oxygen Measurements

Purpose/Brief History:

The Radiation Biology Branch conducts studies on cellular and whole animal responses to gamma-irradiation, chemotherapy drugs and radio-protectors and sensitizers.  One sensitizer of radiation is oxygen and its measurement in tumors and normal tissue is paramount for a determination of the effectiveness of radiation treatment of tumors.

             This procurement will provide for the acquisition of an mobile L-band EPR scanner which will be used to determine oxygen concentrations in animals.  Magnettech GmbH is the only company which makes the mobile scanners with the required sensitivity and ease of control.  The scanner will be ideal for our animal facility which has limited space. 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

            Magnettech GmbH is the only company which makes the mobile L-band EPR spectrometer which can measure oxygen and paramagnetic compounds in tissue of animals.

Sole source determination is based on NIST’s need to have a high sensitivity, low cost, and low weight, plastic scintillator and electronics that provides natural background rejection capabilities. It also needs to include a radiation pager (or pocket-sized personal radiation detector) that can be mounted in front of the user to allow maximum detection probability as a function of source orientation to user. This instrument is going to be part a robot and radiation detector integration exercise for which detection sensitivity and finding capabilities due to source-to-user orientation is crucial.  Thermo Electron Corp is the sole manufacturer of the equipment which includes unique and proprietary design capabilities that are required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements as stated above.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination and be completed in accordance with the Contactor’s commercial schedule.

As defined in the federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), F.O.B. Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at delivery point specified in the purchase order, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334519, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 28, 2006.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice The Contracting Center of Excellence contemplates posting a solicitation within 15 days for a requirement necessary to provide support for Enhancements for Hard & Deeply Buried Target Defeat and the New Triad for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defens e (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics).  The New Triad has delineated the diverse capabilities needed to achieve our national strategic objectives.  Ballistic missile defenses, passive defenses, non-nuclear strategic strike systems, and the future trans formed conventional force all will contribute to meeting U.S. deterrence objectives.  Key to these is an increased contribution from non-nuclear means to achieve U.S. objectives.  This is an important theme of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), but non-nucl ear means alone are unlikely to satisfy U.S. objectives in all circumstances. U.S. nuclear weapons will continue to play a unique deterrence role. As in the Cold War, such weapons should cause virtually any hostile nation to step back and think again abo ut the dangers of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)-backed aggression and WMD escalation.  The Performance Work Statement contains several tasks that will assist Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)s efforts to oversee New Triad program development and ex ecution, while providing the information to support the maintenance enhanced deterrence.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to provide support as define d in the Performance Work Statement.  A Firm Fixed Price/Time and Material Contract is intended and is expected to be competed as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The NAICS code is 541710.  The period of performance will be a base year plus four one-year (12 months) option periods.  A written RFP and PWS will be posted for download on the DCC-W Homepage at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.asp  within 15 days entitled HDBT, (Enhancement  for Hard & Deeply Buried Target Defeat and the New Triad.)

<DESC>The spillway gates at McNary Dam are vertical lift, roller type gates.  Each gate is 50 wide by 52 tall.  Each gate consists of two leaves, a 27 tall upper leaf and a 25 tall lower leaf.  The leaves are connected with a horizontal joint.  Each ga te is equipped with 18 wheel assemblies, 9 wheels per side.  A wheel assembly consists of a 27 diameter steel wheel rim, 8.5 wide, steel wheel flanges, bearing, steel axle shaft 4 long by 11 diameter, seals, retainers and bolts.  All steel parts of the  wheel assemblies are machined to size and finish.  Work will be performed in the spillway gate storage and repair pits.  When a gate is split in two, one leaf goes into the repair pit and the other leaf goes into the storage pit.  Up to four gates are to be rehabilitated. Work will consist of removing all horizontal and vertical rubber seals (flat and J-seals) and installing new seals.  The wheel assemblies are to be removed, disassembled, inspected and rebuilt, or replaced.  Some wheel parts such as seals, retainers, and b olts are to be replaced with new parts.  Some parts such as wheel rims may need to be rebuilt, may need to be replaced with new, or may be reusable without repair depending on inspection results.  Portions of the upstream face of the gate and other specifi ed areas are to be painted with vinyl paint.  Existing paint contains lead and must be removed where new paint will be applied.  Fabricate and install some miscellaneous metalwork items on the gates.  Machine the embedded gate guide slots in the spill bays  where the rehabilitated gates are located.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS).  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO PROVIDE STATISTICAL CONSULTING FOR THE AMMOP YAKUTAT SET GILLNET FISHERY WITH WEST ECOSYSTEMS INC. (WEST).  WEST HAS PROVIDED STATISTICAL SERVICES, UNDER CONTRACT TO NMFS AS DIRECTED BY THE ALASKA MARINE MAMMAL OBSERVER PROGRAM, FOR THE 2002 AND 2005 FISHING SEASON FOR THE KODIAK SET GILLNET FISHERY.

THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH OBSERVER PROGRAMS AND CONTENTIOUS FISHERIES AND ALASKAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT ISSUES, AND HAVE PROVIDED OUTSTANDING ANALYSIS IN THE PAST FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE.  THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS FOR THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PLANS IN ALASKA AND IT REQUIRES VERY SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE AND PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION TO WHICH WEST,  CAN BE ENTRUSTED.  THE WORK MUST BE PERFORMED BY SCIENTISTS WITH A MASTER’S OR PHD IN STATISTICS OR BIOMETRICS, WITH DETAILED TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN APPLYING THOSE FIELDS TO STUDIES INVOLVED IN ASSESSING SET GILLNET FISHERIES INTERACTION AND MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS IN ALASKA.

HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATA NEEDS OF THE AMMOP AND UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING OF SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS TYPE OF FISHERY FROM A STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE ARE UNIQUE.  ADDITIONALLY, CONSISTENCY IN SAMPLING APPROACH FROM ONE FISHERY TO ANOTHER IS CRITICAL FOR OUR PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT DATA SETS BETWEEN FISHERIES ARE STATISTICALLY COMPARABLE.  THE SET GILLNET FISHERIES IN ALASKA ARE A UNIQUE COMMERCIAL FISHING STRATEGY USED ONLY IN ALASKA, AND NO OTHER PROGRAM HAS CONDUCTED THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THE AMMOP PERFORMS IN THESE FISHERIES.

<SUBJECT>36 -- Two Gas Heated Composite Curing Ovens for composite facility
<SOLNBR>FA4497-06-T-0008
<CONTACT>Rafael Taylor, Contract Specialist, Phone 302-677-5233, Fax 302-677-5217, Email rafael.taylor2@dover.af.mil
<DESC>Purchase two gas heated oven units for our composite facility - one small and one large. 
Approximant dimensions for large oven

Inside dimensions: 8'W x 12'D x 6-1/2'H
Outside dimensions: 10'W x 16'D x 7-1/2'H

Approximant dimensions for small oven

Inside dimensions: 4'W x 10'D x 6-1/2'H
Outside dimensions: 6'W x 12'9"D x 7-1/2'H


Control and data acquisition systems require having both ovens controlled through the same computer system mounted in a main central free standing control console.

Keeping in mind the 30'W x 20'D area in which the two units must be installed.  Heater boxes will be in the rear for both units because of the 11' overhead clearance restriction.  Blower drive motors will be oriented keeping service access in mind for both units. Access outside roll up door to the building is 14’W X 10’ H

Software, to allow for data transferred to customer supplied computer to be charted through spreadsheet software, to allow for real time monitoring, data acquisition and archiving on customer computer through customer supplied Ethernet cable.  

Desktop computer and inkjet printer, to be dedicated to programming, operation, data acquisition and printout of run data for the systems. 

Programming and setting up the system for operation with the multiple vacuum ports
And thermocouple jack locations.

Door switch, to shut down heat and circulation if doors are opened while chamber is at elevated temperatures.  This feature will protect operational personnel if the oven must be opened while operating.

The oven will be designed for composite curing of various parts, where it is assumed that the total load weight will be approximately 1,000 lbs. or less, including all tooling and racks.

Rate of heating and cooling is assumed to be the same as the aerospace industry standard, i.e. 4 to 7 deg. F per minute.  To provide for control of the cooling rate, we have included an exhaust blower controlled through a variable frequency drive.  Rates of heating and cooling can always be slower than stated above; as a slower rate can be set into the programmer Maximum operating temperature for this oven will be 500 deg. F.  It is understood that the normal operating temperature will be in the neighborhood of 350 to 400 deg. F.

No Floor -

The oven will be provided without a floor of its own.  The customer=s concrete plant floor will act as the floor of the chamber for maximum flexibility in loading.

Vacuum Ports - 

The oven will be supplied with eight (8) vacuum ports, four (4) per side, evenly spaced from front to back.  An external header will be provided on each side of the oven, with a total of four (4) legs projecting into the oven chamber on each side, terminating in barb type connections.  A check valve will be supplied every 4 ft. on the external headers.  Each leg will be provided with its own ball type shutoff valve, and the main headers will be provided with a ball type shut-off valve where connection is made to the customer supplied vacuum source.  Adjacent to each port will be a second port, leading out to a Honeywell digital indicating vacuum transducer, which will feed its signal to the HC900.  

A vacuum line is taken from the primary vacuum port to the bag around the part.  A second line goes from the bag to the secondary port, alongside the primary port, so vacuum is read downstream of the bag.  This allows for bag leaks to be detected.
	
Thermocouple Ports - 

A total of eight (8) thermocouple jack positions will be provided on the interior wall of the chamber, with one (1) jack position adjacent to each vacuum port.  Matching male jacks will be provided for customer use.  Jack positions will feed their signals to the HC900.

or an equivalent Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) convection-type curing oven may be acceptable for award.

Specifically, the unit shall meet at the minimum the specified dimensions and temperature requirements above. This requirement shall be fulfilled by supplying “commercial items” as defined in Section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The convection-type curing oven units are to be procured as Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) and/or Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items

Installation and oven start-up, check-out and operator training

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).     We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.
Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release       August 06
Industry Day            September 06
RFP Release             October 06
Contract Award          May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.     RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.     The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:     Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.     Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.     All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).     This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).     Each simulator has no motion.     Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.     The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.     The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.     The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.     Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.     Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.     The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATD?s are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).     The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.     It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.     The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.       A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.     The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.     The courseware was developed using Authorware.     Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)     TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.     Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.     The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.     At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.     There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.     The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.     At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.     Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.     Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.     The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.     Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.     Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.     TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.     The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.     Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.     Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.     It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory intends to award a sole source contract to General Dynamics - Ordinance and Tactical Systems for engineering and technical support for the continued engineering testing support by US Army Armament Research, Design, and Engineering Command (ARDEC), of the XM-326 Dragon Fire II (DF II).  The tasks includes engineering/technical support in completing the XM-326 firing tests, follow-on teardown examination and inspection to verify system performance and safety characteristics, providing spare parts, and to develop and deliver a report that documents all the findings, as a result of the firing tests, teardown examination, and inspection, in order to prepare the system for use in a tactical environment. General Dynamics - Ordinance and Tactical Systems, Healdsburg, CA was awarded contract W15QKN-04-M-0026 on 21 November 2003 for the design, fabrication, test, and integration support of the gun elevation, traverse, semi-automatic loading device (SALD) and firing mechanism drives for the Dragonfire II Mortar Weapon System. 1.0	SCOPE.  This Statement of Work (SOW) delineates the tasks to be performed to support the continued engineering testing support by US Army Armament Research, Design, and Engineering Command (ARDEC), of the XM-326 Dragon Fire II (DF II).  The tasks includes engineering/technical support in completing the XM-326 firing tests, follow-on teardown examination and inspection to verify system performance and safety characteristics, and to develop and deliver a report that documents all the findings, as a result of the firing tests, teardown examination, and inspection, in order to prepare the system for use in a tactical environment.   The XM-326 is being tested as a dedicated counterfire response system for the United States Army Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) system.  The support shall consist of the necessary engineering/technical personnel and materiel for the XM-326 firing tests at Yuma Proving Ground, AZ and the teardown and inspection of the XM-326 at Rock Island Arsenal, IL in support of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL).  2.0	BACKGROUND.  The 120 millimeter XM-326 DF II is being developed as a concept demonstrator system to explore the benefits of advanced technology for indirect fire systems. Based on the seven years’ of experimentation with Dragon Fire I, certain new technologies were shown to improve precision and responsiveness of artillery systems; however, a new system had to be designed to encompass the operational “lessons learned” from the first design.  As an example of this, the weight of the Mobile Fire Support System (MFSS) was 6,900 pounds and has proven to be too heavy to safely tow behind the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  After a lengthy and exhaustive redesign of the weapon system, the new XM-326 weighs about half of the weight of the first Dragon Fire (3,750 pounds), uses General Dynamics-Ordnance & Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) electric actuators of an advanced design and a fire control system based on the US Army M-95 Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS). !  The new weapon is completed and based on its design capabilities for very fast response and high precision, is being tested as a potential dedicated counterfire system for the C-RAM system and to serve as an advanced technology counterfire system in combat. 3.0 TASK DESCRIPTION.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  Contractor shall provide the necessary engineers and technicians to support in the preparation and maintenance of the XM-326 during the safety and engineering tests to be conducted at Yuma Proving Ground AZ.      3.1 Provide engineering support for the electric actuator system of the XM-326 during engineering and safety testing.         3.1.1 The contractor shall test and prepare the XM-326 electric actuator systems at the contractor’s facilities prior to the firing tests at Yuma Proving Ground.          3.1.2 The contractor shall provide the necessary engineers/technicians to support the XM-326 engineering preparations for and field assistance to, the firing tests at Yuma Proving Ground, AZ during.      3.2 Provide engineering support for the electric actuator system of the XM-326 during the teardown and inspection of the XM-326 at Rock Island Arsenal IL.         3.2.1 The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel to support the US Army Armament Research Design and Engineering Command team at Rock Island Arsenal during disassembling and inspection of the XM-326 after the safety and engineering tests.

<CONTACT>Kris Swofford Contracting Officer 4156638522230  kris_swofford@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is soliciting interested and qualified sources to perform watershed restoration (heavy equipment) work at Redwood National Park.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, materials and supervision as necessary to accomplish restoration projects that include removing roads, landings, and skid roads to reduce future erosion and restore natural landforms and watershed systems.  Most work is located in the Lost Man Creek watershed at Redwood National Park, approximately 3 miles north of the town of Orick, Humboldt County, CA. Work involves excavating road fill from stream channels, pulling back side-cast road fill, decompacting roads, retrieving and burying debris from logging and other activities (culverts, cable, concrete foundations, etc.), and restoring the natural configuration of the land (ridges, stream valleys and swales).  The finished surfaces of all areas disturbed by the equipment shall be left in a manner suitable for transplanting.  Reconstruction of failed sections of road is often necessary in order to access the road removal work sites.  The terrain in the area is steep, irregular, and vegetated with 25-50 year old second growth redwood forest.  The nature of the work will require equipment to be used on steep terrain and in difficult working conditions.  Equipment will be required to push fill material up steep inclines as well as shape and finish steep slopes.  This will require the equipment to traverse, move around, and sit on steep slopes while performing the work.  Access to some work sites, or portions of work sites, will require operator skill and dexterity to minimize access impacts over steep irregular ground.  The size of excavations associated with this work can range from less than one hundred cubic yards to several thousand cubic yards in volume.  Heavy equipment work will be limited to 50-55 hours per week requiring at least two days off in any two week period.  Hours of operation will only be permitted between sunrise and sunset.  It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded for this work effort that will include a base year plus options to extend up to three additional years.  The estimated range for projects to be awarded is $25,000 (minimum) to $750,000 (maximum) each year.  Projects will be implemented through the issuance of individual task orders.  Due to critical habitat and endangered species concerns and restrictions within the work areas, project work is limited to a very short window that begins late summer (typically mid July) of each year and ends mid October each year.  (The first contract year project however, is expected not to start until September 16, 2006).  Award selection will be based on a Best Value determination made after considering costs and factors other than costs (experience, past performance, etc.) as set forth in the solicitation.  There is a likelihood that an award will be made to two or more of the most highly rated offerors.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available via electronic commerce only and can be accessed on/after August 2, 2006 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov or directly through the DOI National Business Center site at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after issuance.  The Contractor is responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFP.  This acquisition is unrestricted pursuant to Public Law 100-656.  Any/all responsible sources may submit a proposal which, if timely received, will be considered.  (Note:  This announcement modification changes the Classification Code only.  All other information remains unchanged.)

<DESC>Below are questions that have been submitted about RFP RA133W06RP0182 and the Government's responses.   Also note that a 2002 American Geophysical Union poster is now included as an attached PDF file.  

Question 1:

Will the Government provide the code for the models required to complete Task 4 to the Contractor, to be run on the Contractor’s computer systems? Alternatively, will the Government provide the Contractor with the means to run these models on the Government’s computer systems?

Answer:

The Government will not provide the models required to complete Task 4.  Neither the source code to be run on the Contractor’s computer systems nor the Government’s computer systems will be provided.  Most of these models are in the public domain, with exceptions noted below for the HAFv2 model.  The Contractor is expected to contact the authors of the models as needed to determine the necessary information and/or obtain the source code.

Note that Exploration Physics International,  Inc., (EXPI)  retains commercial proprietary rights to the Hakamada-Akasofu-Fry  (HAFv2) model. HAFv2 is also subject to Export Control.  Questions concerning the HAFv2 model can be directed to:

Tel: 256-971-4080 
Email: gfry@expi.com

Question 2:
Will the Contractor be required to run the XFL and FLA flare location algorithms to complete Tasks 5-7, or will the Government provide all necessary outputs from these algorithms to the Contractor?

Answer:
The Contractor will not be required to run the XFL and FLA flare location algorithms.  As stated in C.1.1.3.b, the government will furnish the Edited Events dataset that includes the XFL and FLA result values. The dataset furnished will include necessary supporting information, such as date and time, maximum flare brightness, etc. 

Question 3:
In addition to the SEC Edited Events data set and the SXI Image dataset, can the Government furnish the SXI flare location algorithm? If not, can the Government furnish references concerning this algorithm?

Answer:
The most detailed description of the reference is contained in a 2002 American Geophysical Union poster, which is now included as an attached PDF file. Note that this poster conceptually represents the algorithm, but changes to parameters have been made since GOES 12 entered operations in 2003. The Government does not intend to furnish the flare algorithm because it is not necessary for the work to be performed. The Government may reconsider its decision if provided with a compelling reason why furnishing the algorithm (as code) would enable better performance of the tasks 5-7.

Question 4:
Is it the intent of the Government to furnish the complete SXI image data set or only a subset? If it is the latter, how is this subset defined?

Answer:
As stated in C.1.1.3.b, “The comparison will be done on limited but representative periods of high, moderate, and low solar activity.” The Government will select the representative periods and provide the data for those periods only. The Government expects to select no less than one Carrington rotation worth of data for each level of solar activity. The total data will include no more than 6 Carrington rotations worth of data. The full SXI data set is available to the public at http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.  The Government has a requirement to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial for Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). NIAID intends to solicit this project utilizing full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about June 15, 2007.  The objective of a contract will be to advance the field of clinical management for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and to determine the optimal outpatient treatment strategy.  If selected the contractor would be expected to provide the scientific, technical, and managerial infrastructure, facilities, and other resources required to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial.  In addition, the contractor must have the ability to determine the efficacy of off-patent oral antimicrobials and/or wound care for the treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection in areas in the U.S, where the prevalence of CA-MRSA is high. An uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection is defined as the presence of wound infection, abscesses, folliculitis, cellulitis or erysipelas. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are defined as the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the relevant disease process from subjects who have not been hospitalized within the previous fourteen (14) days. In order to preserve the efficacy of vancomycin and linezolid, evaluation of these two antimicrobials would not be supported under this effort. In addition, clinical trials of invasive diseases (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomylitis or pneumonia) or clinical trials with hospitalized patients would not be supported under this contract. Clinical trials under this effort would require a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) clinical trial sites. Each clinical trial site, included would also be required to have access to one hundred and twenty (120) subjects with skin and soft tissue infection every three (3) months to ensure enrollment of a minimum of forty (40) subjects every three (3) months.  It is estimated that a total effort of approximately 9.65 FTEs per year will be needed to accomplish this project.  
This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 15, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. NO FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

Project Solicitation


THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factors and sub-factors. 

Prior Prequalification

Firms that submitted a prequalification package for projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2004 and/or 2005 and/or 2006   and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 

	Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with the above. However, if any changes have occurred in a company's structure, size status, or Primary Design-Build Team since the submission of the original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for these projects.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation.

<DESC>Reference Amendment # 1 to SSA-RFQ-02-06-1005, Replace Fire Exit Doors at the SSA Facility in Queens, New York.   My initial cover letter to this amendment indicated that Bid and Performance Bonds would be required.  The actual amendment, however, added FAR Clause 52.228-16 Performance and Payment Bonds-Other than Construction in Section C-3.2 (copy attached).  The amendment accurately reflects the types of bonds required.  

A bid bond is not required for this contract.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 212-2664-2766, or by e-mail at andrew.argiro@ssa.gov  .

PURPOSE
The 827th ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to manufacture a palletized latrine that meets the airworthiness certification criteria for use on the C/KC-135 aircraft.  The palletized latrine will be loaded on the aircraft through the cargo door and it will have sufficient capacity to support 11 people for up to 14 hours, without servicing.  Since the KC-135 is considered a fuel vapor area, non-electrical powered toilet(s) is preferred.

DESCRIPTION
The palletized latrine can consist of multiple toilets (to attain capacity requirement) attached to a HCU-6/E pallet that will be secured on the aircraft at pallet location 6 and serviced through the aft hatch.  The HCU-6/E pallet is 108” x 88” per Mil-DTL-27443 Type 1.  The pallet has a usable area of 104” x 84” and a loadable height of 65 inches.  Some type of pan is required beneath toilet(s) to catch any spills.  The palletized latrine will have no doors or walls.  The toilet(s) should be serviceable without removing the pallet from the aircraft.  
 
Images and documents to aid in the response to this RFI are attached under ALL FILES as follows:

Attachment #1: KC-135 Pallet Layout
Attachment #2: General Specification for C/KC-135 Tailored Airworthiness Certification Criteria (TACC), Version 2.0 dated 23 Dec 02
Attachment #3: Mil-DTL-27443 Pallets, Cargo, Aircraft Types HCU-6/E and HCU-12/E

<RESPDATE>080706
<CONTACT>Terence J. McGinn; terence.mcginn@usmc.mil
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking potential commercial sources to fabricate, test and deliver a Linear Demolition Charge System (LDCS) for the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV).  The ABV is being developed and fielded by the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), which is responsible for the acquisition of weapons and equipment for the United States Marine Corps (USMC).  The ABV is a tracked, combat engineer vehicle designed to breach complex obstacles and mine fields.  It is based on the M1A1 tank chassis and incorporates several commercial subsystems to accomplish specific breaching requirements.  The ABV is an Acquisition Category III (ACAT-III), Marine Corps program and is currently preparing for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E). The LDCS consists of all the hardware required to employ two Mk 58 Line Charge Systems with A4 fuse assemblies and two Mk 22 Rockets as part of complex breaching operations.  The LDCS is installed on the rear portion of the turret of the ABV and receives electrical power from the host vehicle.  It consists of two launcher assemblies (frame, rocket rail, and electrical components), one control box, one local/remote switch box, one Linear Demolition Charge (LDC) selector switch box (which switches between the port and starboard launchers), and all the interconnecting cables.  It provides the functionality that enables the vehicle commander, while under cover of armor, to select the port or starboard launcher, raise the rocket rail to the firing position, launch the rocket, and detonate the line charge once it has been deployed by the rocket.  The LDCS contains an interface for a separate remote control system, which can be used when the vehicle is operated in an unmanned mode. The following available documents provide the technical drawings and interface diagram for the LDCS. 1.  LDCS Technical Data Package 2.  LDCS Control System Requirements, July 8, 2005 3.  LDCS Interface Control Document Vendors desiring electronic copies of these documents may contact Mr. Joseph Burns at 703-432-3747; e-mail joseph.c.burns@usmc.mil.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) on Collapsible Shipping and Storage Containers, 1500 lbs.   This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(c).  The intent of the RFI is to identify potential suppliers of containers capable of ultimately providing this requirement in large quantities for the Department of Defense.  It is the Navy's intention to procure small quantities of approximately 4 different containers for test and evaluation (Needed in Nov/Dec 06).  Following test and evaluation, a procurement of several hundred containers for use in a military exercise is planned (needed by Feb/Mar 07) in conjunction with a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD).  This JCTD is evaluating the Joint Modular Intermodal Container (JMIC) as part of the Joint Modular Intermodal Distribution System (JMIDS). JMIC is expected to be a family of containers potentially including both heavy duty containers (for materials such as ordnance), and lighter duty containers (the subject of this solicitation). If that evaluation demonstrates effectiveness of the JMIC concept, and of the procured containers, the Department of Defense may procure large quantities of similar containers, for general use within the Defense Transportation System (FY-08 and beyond).  The future containers will have a common footprint and interface and may also include other heights as well as multiples of the basic footprints for items too large to fit within the basic footprint (double long, double wide, etc).

This is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor can there be any claims levied against the Government as a result of any information submitted by respondents.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   Potential uses for the information received may result in future Request for Quotation’s (RFQs), but knowledge of this cannot be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government.

The future containers will have a common footprint and interface and may also include other heights as well as multiples of the basic footprints for items too large to fit within the basic footprint (double long, double wide, etc).

This is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor can there be any claims levied against the Government as a result of any information submitted by respondents.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   Potential uses for the information received may result in future Request for Quotation’s (RFQs), but knowledge of this cannot be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government.  

Container performance requirements and referenced drawings are attached.  The documents and drawing can also be accessed at www.neco.navy.mil .  Vendors should submit their responses electronically NLT31 July 2006 to the following: Daniel.damanskis@navy.mil.  Phone: 215.697.9730, Fax 215.697.9574

<DESC>Sources Sought

Air Combat Command Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB VA, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to procure an Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device 2 (ROBD2) suitable for use in training USAF aircrew in hypoxia recognition and recovery.  The word suitable implies a device that can rapidly achieve and consistently maintain the desired simulated altitude at low cost when mass-produced, be portable, durable, reliable, and simple to operate and maintain, has low man-hour and monetary maintenance requirements and replicates appropriate hypoxia recovery functions of current AF aircraft oxygen systems.  The AF requires two additional improvements from the contractor that when properly implemented, will meet the primary program objective.  These improvements are:

Upon activation, the 100% Oxygen Dump switch will deliver 100% Oxygen at a positive pressure of 5.0 inches of water pressure to the aircrew mask.
This positive pressure function replicates the pressure demand regulator features found in USAF aircraft and provides not only quicker hypoxia recovery but also important feedback to the aircrew member on regulator function and for troubleshooting Oxygen regulator failure.

At no time shall the ROBD be capable of delivering more than 96% Nitrogen to the aircrew mask.  
This safety feature will protect the student or operator from accidentally receiving hazardous levels of Nitrogen gas while the ROBD is in operation.

 
The government expects to make an award on or about 15 Sep 06, with a delivery of     12 – 18 weeks after receipt of order.  This acquisition will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) on or about 15 Aug 06.  Draft Statement of Work (SOW) will be posted with the RFP.  Interested parties should review these documents and provide any comments via e-mail to this office.  The Air Force will consider and respond to all inputs received.  Industry response is encouraged to ensure all parties have maximum opportunity to participate in this acquisition.  The government plans to use the Internet and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information.  Hard copies will not be made available.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334513.  The government seeks industry input to determine if this acquisition should be a total set-aside under the auspice of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.  Interested small businesses who are certified and qualified as a small business concern in NAICS 334513 are encouraged to respond and submit their notification to this office NLT COB on 2 Aug 06.  Responding small business may later be required to submit a capabilities package outlining their capabilities in key areas as determined by the government and relevant to the performance of this requirement.  To assist us in maintaining a list of interested offerors for this potential procurement, please provide your company name, a point of contact, address, and phone number and business size under the above NAICS code, to the POC for this procurement:  Claudia Perry, ACC CONS/LGCB, 757-225-1891, email address is claudia.perry@langley.af.mil

<DESC>The United State Senate requires support to supplement the Sergeant at Arms professional staff and assist in design and development of software components for financial management and legislative systems and other systems, as necessary.  The personnel will work within existing teams under project management from the Senate.  The Senate anticipates the need for two programmer/analysts for the legislative system and one programmer/analyst for the financial management system for a twelve-month period.  Depending on work accomplished and project schedules, the contract may contain four option periods, each for an additional 12 months of support.  Depending on project schedules and work requirements, the Senate may require additional contractor personnel during the period of performance.  BACKGROUND: The Senate has several major mission critical systems which support its core business functions.  The Financial Management Information Management System (FMIS) is an integrated financial management system for the Senate.  The Legislative Information System (LIS) supports the key business process of tracking, storing, reporting and distributing legislative data.  FMIS uses Bearing Point software products (Federal Financial Management Information System (FAMIS) and Advanced Purchasing/Inventory Control System (ADPICS) as the core general ledger and purchasing components.  Custom reports not available in FAMIS /ADPICS standard reports are designed using Business Objects’ Crystal Reports.  FMIS has interfaces with other Senate financial systems such as the Senate’s payroll system and a browser-based interface to the FAMIS/ADPICS vendor files.  LIS is a mission critical application which handles data vital to the Senate legislative process.  The core component of LIS is a Documentum Document Management System (DMS) running on an Oracle database.  The primary application was developed using Visual Basic for the user interface and Business Objects’ Crystal Reports as the reporting mechanism.  System upgrades are under development to incorporate .NET technology and web-based application components.  REQUIREMENTS: Failure to provide information on requested information or requirements below may result in disqualification of the vendor from further consideration by the SAA.  Qualified vendors must show their ability to provide these services by providing:  a) A resume(s) (limited to three pages) for the programmer or analyst which must demonstrate each of the following abilities, qualifications and certifications for programmer/analyst(s) assigned to work with the Senate Technology Development Services Department staff to design, develop, and implement enhancements or new components for FMIS and LIS demonstrating  extensive experience in applications development; personnel supporting FMIS must have knowledge of and experience with FAMIS/ADPICS, Business Objects’ Crystal Reports and web development tools.  Contractor personnel supporting the LIS applications must have knowledge of and experience with Document Management Systems.  Documentum, Oracle Database, Business Objects’ Crystal Reports, and .NET technology experience is required.  Web technology expertise will also be valuable in supporting current and future the LIS applications development projects.  All contractor programmer/analyst(s) must be able to operate with minimal supervision.  b) Three past performance references within the last two years in which the vendor has successfully provided the services.  Each past performance reference must provide: 1) name of the customer or company; 2) name and phone number of the primary contact with customer or company; 3) brief description of contract; 4) dates of services; and 5) total contract value.  INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this sources sought request are due to the POC no later than August 7, 2006 at Noon EDT and shall be submitted electronically via email only to the attention of Kathleen M. Haddow at acquisitions@saa.senate.gov. The subject line of the email message shall be SSN 2006-S-058.  No other method of transmittal will be accepted.  The response shall not exceed ten (10) pages (excluding resumes).  Pages over the page limitation may be discarded.  Access by the SAA to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party.  Neither the SAA nor the Senate is responsible for any failure to access vendor’s information.  The information supplied in response to this sources sought notice will be used to pre-qualify firms that may be invited to submit proposals.  Vendors responding to this sources sought notice and deemed qualified by the SAA will be requested to submit a proposal in response to a solicitation or request for quotation.  Only pre-qualified firms will be permitted to submit proposals.  If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the SAA anticipates release of a solicitation or request for quotation on or about August 15, 2006.  Neither the SAA nor the Senate will be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this request.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SAA OR SENATE.  ANY TELEPHONE OR E-MAIL REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE HONORED.

However, this market research effort is sought to increase our awareness of, and opportunities for, local small and other small business resou rces that could assist in the event the existing emergency contract capacities/capabilities are exceeded, as well as to have a cadre of local small and other small business contractors who can respond to additional mission assignments in other relief areas .  It is envisioned that due to the timeframe needed to respond to the emergency situations, limited competitive procurement procedures will need to be utilized for actions not issued under existing emergency contracts.  Where opportunities for full and op en competition exist, we will utilize that procurement process. Awards will be conducted in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C., 5121 et seq.) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 26. 2 Disaster or Emergency Assistance Activities which provides preference to the extent feasible and practicable, to those organizations, firms, or individuals residing or doing business in the area affected by such major disasters or emergencies   As part of this process, we are seeking information about local small and other small businesses capable of providing the following services that could be required under a hurricane relief effort: (1) Temporary Roofing/Housing; (2) Debris Removal, (3) Dred ging, (4) Levee and Placement Area Repairs (5) Power Generation Support, (6) Water, (7) Ice, (8) Quality Assurance personnel for assessing Roofing and Debris impacts as well as assisting during performance of recovery work.(9) water, sewer, and electrical hookup for mobile and travel trailers, (10) Beach Restoration, (11) electrical work, and (12) sandbags. If interested, please register at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/hurricane/register.aspx   providing the specific information requested.  Failure to provide complete information will result in no further consideration of your firm.  Information from  other than local small or other small businesses will not be considered.

<SUBJECT>NEW NOTICE!!! for NROWS Special Notice issued 20 July 2006
<DESC>DON-SNOTE-060720-002 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:   The goal of Networked Remotely Operated Weapons Systems (NROWS) Phase III will be to create a realistic test facility defended by a network of remotely operated weapons (functional, but without real weapons installed), and to use this facility to evaluate and improve NROWS technology and operational concepts.  In this facility many capabilities that might be part of an actual NROWS installation will be implemented. Specifically, this will include: â€¢ Multiple NROWS deployed in several locations including indoors, outdoors in fixed positions, and on an unmanned ground vehicle â€¢ Various housing options â€¢ Key safety features that are necessary for safety certification â€¢ Optimization of operator interface based on human factors study and prior research â€¢ Control Center â€¢ Maintenance Console â€¢ Sensor integration The Phase III proposal is for procurement of developmental equipment, including software and hardware, from TeleRobotics Corporation (TRC).  The proposed procurement will constitute the third follow on phase of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC SD) Code 2371 Network Remotely Operated Weapon Systems (NROWS) project.  The first phase of the NROWS project was a Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA sponsored project beginning in 2003 where work with TRC began as Code 2371 purchased a weapons aiming platform from the aforementioned vendor. As a follow on phase II of the project, collaboration for development continued between Code 2371 and TRC beginning in 2005 and ending in 2006.  This phase II effort was facilitated under the procurement contract number N66001-06-M-R332.  The phase II effort is in process and intended to bring the NROWS system to a state of field readiness.  This phase will conclude with a realistic facility defense scenario demonstration employing three NROWS systems. The current proposed phase III contract will be the third phase of project development and will purchase five NROWS platforms, two â€œsaddleâ€ weapons adapters for M240 Machine Guns, and supporting labor from TRC during development. The five NROWS platforms will include two roof mounted housings, one ground-mounted â€œPop-upâ€ housing, one Standard-size platform with environmental package, and one platform optimized for an unmanned ground vehicle.  This follow on phase of NROWS development will make substantial improvements in the network operability of the NROWS systems and bring the NROWS system to a fieldable state.  The development plan will focus on bringing the NROWS to the point of readiness for fielding per the original objectives of the DTRA program.  SSC SD will work closely with TeleRobotics Corp. (TRC) to accomplish these objectives. Questions concerning this effort should be addressed to madelynn.whittington@navy.mil

The USMS Office of Interagency Medical Services (OIMS) works to assure that the health care provided to the USMS prisoners housed within 95 USMS District Offices (DOs), and approximately 200 District Sub-offices (DOSUBs) is consistent with established Prisoner Health Care Standards (PHCS) guidelines described in USMS Publication Number 100 http://www.usmarshals.gov/prisoner/standards.htm . USMS expends approximately $22.5 million per year for all medical services delivered to prisoners by community medical care providers outside the walls of detention facilities. In addition to the funds for the medical claims, the USMS also expends approximately $9 million a year for prescription drugs.
 
The purpose of this contract is to:  (1) establish a nationwide integrated health care delivery system; and (2) process and pay medical claims consistent with the Medicare payment standards required by 18 U.S.C. 4006, as amended.  The manner in which the Contractor elects to provide these services shall be determined by the Contractor in consultation with OIMS: OIMS shall grant final approval.  The USMS requires the services in this document in order to meet its basic mission of providing health care to USMS prisoners.  A managed health care system, which includes negotiated contracts with medical facilities and providers, claims processing and payment, interactive website, utilization review, and quality management enables the USMS to arrange for appropriate prisoner health care at substantial savings to the taxpayer.

The OFDT is requesting industry to review the draft SOW and offer feedback on industry standards, specific technologies and/or capabilities to meet the SOW requirements, and approaches for how OFDT/USMS can more effectively and efficiently prepare this RFP.

Industry comments are limited to (thirty) 30 pages using no less than 12-point font and one-inch margins.  Responses must be prepared in the following format:

•	Provide a two-page executive summary; 
•	Answer the following questions: 

1.	In private industry, what is considered to be a contractor generated claims error that would reflect adversely on contractor performance? What types of claims errors should be considered as an indicator of substandard performance by a contractor?
2.	OIMS is requesting the Contractor to maintain original copies of the claims submitted to OIMS for payment to the contractor.  For each claim, submitted the Contractor will be responsible for submitting a copy of the claim to OIMS with the Monthly Transaction Report (MTR) and Explanation of Benefits (EOB).  OIMS wants to have this information available on the USMS interactive Intranet/Internet website.
•       How do you propose submitting the requested information and can technology be utilized to limit paper copies? 
•	What is your experience implementing a paperless process for other government or commercial customers? How would you estimate the cost and, explain the process and its effectiveness? 
•	In an effort to reduce paperwork maintenance for the contractor and the government, provide the current process and any downside for achieving this goal and the feasibility of implementation.
3.	OIMS plan to conduct a monthly statistically valid random audit of the 
	Contractor’s re-pricing and payment of claims. To facilitate this audit, OIMS requires access to the Contractor’s re-pricing system.  Will USMS access to the system be limited by software licensing or any other issues? Will training for my OIMS staff to use the system be an issue?
4.	OIMS requires the Contractor to train the USMS staff and other entities at the 95 USMS District Offices or location determined by OIMS in support of the implementation of the USMS Health Care Delivery System. What training solutions do you offer and recommend?  What are the associated costs for each training solution recommended?
5.	The USMS is seeking assistance in reducing overall prescription costs.  Currently, prescription costs are approximately $9 million per year.  Prescriptions are filled through local and mail-order pharmacy agreements.  The USMS is seeking advice and guidance as part of this RFI on possible solutions to reduce prescription costs.  Prescription services are currently part of the RFI, but may not be part of the RFP – or may be enacted as a later service within the contract.
6.	What would be the optimal term for this contract?
7.	The USMS is soliciting comments on the C.10. Performance-Based Requirements Summary Matrix - Do the Performance-Based Requirements meet industry standards?
8.	With regard C.8.4. Task IV:  Database Management/Information/Reporting the USMS would like to clarifications, suggestions for enhancements, and questions on database development.
9.	With regard to contract time frames the USMS is soliciting comments and suggestions on timeframes, for example database development and processing/ payment of claims.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Rapid, Easy-to-Use Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Emergency Rooms
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Rapid, Easy-to-Use Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Emergency Rooms
                       
Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license an instrument for rapid, point-of-care pathogen detection. 

Background: Patients with “flu-like”symptoms usually wait long hours in emergency rooms (ER) due to lack of rapid diagnostic capability.  Current methods take about two weeks for results to come back, thereby forcing the ER physician to make an “educated guess” based on available clinical data.  “Diagnosis” generally results in costly hospital stays, improper use of antibiotics, and heavy burdens on the med-tech labs.

Description:  This technology gives ER health care providers the capability to diagnose patients with “flu-like” symptoms within 2-3 hours.  From a nasal swab sample from the patient, the automated platform handles sample movement, amplification, hybridization, and data analysis.  Called FluIDx, this diagnostic instrument is being developed for use in hospitals & clinics.
Advantages:  
•	Rapid diagnosis &#61664; perfect for emergency situations &#61664; may reduce length of hospital stays, antibiotic use, lab work &#61664; lower medical costs for the patient
•	Small, Cost-Effective, and Easy-to-Use &#61664; lower operating costs	
•	Multiplexed &#61664; Simultaneous detection of multiple agents from a single sample &#61664; higher productivity 
•	Can easily incorporate other pathogen assays &#61664; higher flexibility and adaptability

Potential Applications:  Although the FluIDx instrument is designed to detect respiratory pathogens in emergency rooms, the technology can be used in any situation where biological assays (enzyme, nucleic acid, protein, etc.) are used. 
•	Biomedical screening and diagnostic applications
•	Bioforensics
•	Drug discovery
•	Proteomics
•	If reduced to a field portable unit, First Responders

Intellectual Property:  U.S. patent applications have been filed for both the platform and the assays.

Development Status:  Two prototypes of the FluIDx instrument have been developed, one of which is being used in the Emergency Room at the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California. 
To view a picture of the prototype go to:
 http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/Pathogen-Detection.php

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's FluIDx technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>W--Temporary lease of Siemens imaging equipment
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VISN 6 Centralized Acquisition Service, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Blue Ridge Medical Imaging Inc, Salem, Virginia for a two month rental of a special procedures suite for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salem, Virginia. This proposed contract action is for an immediate need for temporary use of a mobile Siemens Angiostar Plus system for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 603.2. The VA believes that Blue Ridge Medical Imaging is the only company that can provide immediate delivery of the equipment and service, because the company is local and it can also provide immediate response and service technicians required in the event of breakdown. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet this immediate requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with immediate need for above equipment and the ability to provide immediate response for service calls. Information may be sent to the Contracting Office, VA Medical Center, Hampton, Virginia. 23667. Responses received will be evaluated however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Blue Ridge Medical Imaging.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  PRM/EX is currently using a Network Appliance Netapp Filer F760 on its classified network and plans to upgrade its current model to the FAS250 which incorporates disaster recovery features such as bare-metal restore, image snapshots, and data replication capabilities fully compatible with and supported by the technology and infrastructure currently being used by the State Department to provide secure off-site storage and disaster recovery.  To provide the same level of continuity, disaster recovery capability, and compatibility, PRM/EX plans to procure a second Network Appliance Netapp Filer FAS250 for its unclassified network.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the bureau’s requirements as a key component of its Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP).Netapp Filers have received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-11.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for Low-Rate Calibrated Gas Permeation Tubes to be used in the Process Measurements Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

BACKGROUND
The Process Measurements Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for calibrated gas permeation tubes with chemical warfare simulants for use with our gas microsensor research.  

The chemical warfare simulants (CWSs) required in the tubes sre listed below:
2-Chloroethyl-3chloropropyl sulfide (CECPRS);
Diisobutyl methylphosphonate (DIBMP);
Dipinacolyl methylphosphonate (DPMP); 
O,S-Diisobutyl methylphosphonothiolate (OSDIBMP)

These compounds are unusual: All of them are rare, and some of them are toxic.  Thus, special precautions must be taken in the safe handling and shipping of these compounds, as well as in disposal of waste.  

Each of the four tubes should be calibrated between 30 and 100 degrees Celsius and permeate at a rate between 20 and 60 ng per minute.  Since little information on the permeation of these compounds is known, we understand that the permeation devices will likely be experimental.  NIST will thus accept permeation tubes with rates between 10 ng/min and 100 ng/min.
 , CECPRS, is reported to be corrosive to nickel-bearing alloys (stainless steel),   the CECPRS has been reported to break down when in contact with nickel; hence, this analyte must be delivered in a permeation tube where it is not exposed to nickel, or a nickel bearing alloy.

The Contractor shall perform the following work:
Procure the materials (materials are available from Alfa Aesar and Hestia Laboratories) and properly dispose of any leftover materials and waste.

It is NOT acceptable to ship partially used containers and leftover CWSs to NIST for disposal.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule (partial shipments on this order shall be made as the calibrated tubes are qualified). *** 

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

****The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, 3) Previous Experience, and 4) Price.  Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Previous Experience, when combined, are more important than Price.  Award shall be made on a best value basis.

****Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer   sales literature or other product literature, which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product(s) meet or exceed the specifications stated above.  

****Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service, provided by the Contractor.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/ or information provided by NIST or its’ affiliates.  Quoters shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. 

Past Experience shall be evaluated to determine the extent of the Contractor's experience of at least five (5) years in and knowledge in preparing permeation devices containing toxic and corrosive compounds.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a more detailed solicitation is available on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at  http://www.fedteds.gov/  or at https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=W912HZ-06-T-0039 , which includes exhibits that could not be posted as this site. Hard copies will not be available. Offerors should check  the FEDTEDS Web Page often for new solicitations and/or changes (AMENDMENTS) to existing ones. Solicitation Number W912HZ-06-T-0039 is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) with the intent to award as a firm fixed-price contract using simplified a cquisition procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.  This procurement is 100% small business set-aside under NAICS Code 334513 (SIC 3823) with a size stan dard of 500 Employees. The USACE, ERDC   (Detailed Specifications are available on the FEDTEDS website) This procurement may be quoted as follows:  ITEM DESCRIPTION QUANTITY U/I UNIT PRICE TOTAL AMOUNT 0001 Provide Fiber Optic 2 EA $___________ $_________________ OPTIONAL 0002 Backscatter Sensors in accordance with attached specifications: Provide Fiber Optic Backscatter Sensors in accordance with attached specifications  1 EA $___________ $_________________ 						TOTAL 		$_________________ SPECIFICTIONS 1.  The Large-scale Sediment Transport Facility (LSTF) is a 30 m by 50 m by 1.4 m basin that was constructed to reproduce surf zone processes found on long beaches at a relatively large scale. Research being conducted in the LSTF is leading to improved met hods for estimating surf zone sediment transport. The facility contains wave generators, a recirculation system, a sand beach, an automated instrumentation bridge, and a suite of instruments to measure wave heights, currents, and transported sediment. The LSTF sand beach is approximately 18 m wide by 30 m long, with depths up to 1.0 m.  2.  The purpose of the LSTF is to measure sediment transport and it is equipped with sediment traps that capture the total transport rate, but the traps do not distinguish between suspended or bedload transport.  An instrument that measures suspended conce ntration is a Fiber Optic Backscatter Sensor (FOBS) array.  Each sensor array simultaneously measures sediment concentration at multiple positions in the water column.  Data are logged on a PC-based data acquisition system.  The FOBS sensor arrays enable s imultaneous measurement of suspended sediment concentration at multiple positions through the water column that, together with velocity measurements, allow calculation of local and integrated suspended sediment flux.  In concert with traps in the LSTF that  measure total longshore sediment load and estimates of alongshore suspended sediment flux made with the FOBS, estimates of sediment moving alongshore on and in the bed layer can be made.  Suspended sediment concentration is higher near the bed and the dep ths over which measurements are made are typically 50 cm or less. 3.  The LSTF requires two FOBS.  Each FOBS requires at least 20 sensors spaced to cover a depth of approximately 50 cm.  The first 10 sensors on the lower end should be spaced 1 cm apart.  The remaining, upper, sensors should be spaced logarithmically or q uasi-logarithmically to cover the upper 40 cm.  Each sensor should have a solid-state light source to alleviate problems with phase error.  Each sensor should be capable of accurately measuring concentrations from  0 to 100 mg/l.  The sensors must be durable to withstand waves up to 0.5 m in height, having periods ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 sec, and with 0.5 m/s currents superimposed all concurrently.  The instrument in the water must be of a size as to not disrupt the  flow of waves and currents (on the order of less than 2 cm). 4.  The 2 FOBS must be capable of sampling at 20 Hz.  Data must be transferred from the LSTF instrument bridge to control room.  The LSTF may be expanded in the future; therefore, the instruments must be capable of transmitting data a distance of approxima tely 150 m.  Data output should be in ASCII, or in a format that can easily be integrated into the LSTF data collection software.   5.  The instrument would be required to operate in an extreme environment. The LSTF is located in a shelter and, while protected against rain, it is subjected to heat, cold and humidity. The instrument must be able to operate in ambient temperatures rangin g from 20 deg F to in excess of 100 deg F, and humidity greater than 90 percent. Lastly, the servomotors that operate the wave generators, bridge and cross-shore motor generate electronic noise. The instrument should be immune to electronic noise associate d with existing equipment, or have the capability to operate with DC power, although it is preferred to operate the FOBS from 110V power available on the instrumentation bridge. 6.  The FOBS instruments provided by the vendor should meet the following requirements: a.  Twenty (20) sensors per FOBS that will measure concentration over a 50 cm depth. b.  Spacing of the 10 lower sensors should be 1 cm and spacing of the upper 10 sensors should be logarithmic or quasi-logaritmic spaced over the remaining length. c.  Each of the sensors should have solid-state light source. d.  The FOBS and sensors must be durable to withstand the wave and currents generated in the LSTF: wave heights up to 0.5 m with periods ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 sec superimposed with currents up to 0.5 m/s. e.  Data sampling rate of at least 20 Hz. f.  Capability to transfer data at least 150 m to LSTF control room. g.  Data output in ASCII format or a format that can easily be integrated into LSTF data collection software. h.  Delivery of the product that meets all requirements within 60 days of awarding of contract. Following delivery, acceptance testing will be performed and compared to concentration measurements previously obtained in the LSTF. NOTE:  Specifications and any amendments issued to this solicitation, may be obtained from the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov/.  NOTE: All offerors are responsible for regularly checking the Website for amende ments.

The RCLO is presently assisting the IHT in investigating six cases, although the IHT may add more cases in the future.  Location of the assignment is in Baghdad, Iraq (the International Zone) working principally in the U.S. Embassy or the IHT courthouse.  The US Government will provide housing, meals and laundry service.

Such work may include, but is not limited to, the drafting of legal memoranda on behalf of the IHT, working with the RCLO and IHT to provide security and administrative support to the IHT, and to take all reasonable measures consistent with law which ensures that the IHT is competent and able to perform its duties.

3.4	The Contractor shall be a contractor directly to the RCLO and subject to all relevant Department of Justice, RCLO, and US Embassy regulations, guidelines, rules, and personnel policies..

4.0 	Administrative Requirements

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment/modification is to replace paragraph 2 and replace the evaluation criteria in paragraph 6 under special instructions.

1.  Replace paragraph 2 under special instructions with the following:   “The Contractor is required to quote schedule and/or open market pricing and reasonable shipping charges, if any, in U.S. dollars.  Shipping is f.o.b. destination.  Please provide estimated date of delivery after receipt of order (ARO).  Partial shipments accepted.  Payments will be made in accordance with FAR 52.212-4.”

2.  Replace the evaluation criteria in paragraph 6 under special instructions with the following:

Vendors may propose on one, more than one, all or any combination of CLINS required under this solicitation.  The evaluation of each CLIN proposed will be based on the following steps:

Step 1, vendor proposals will be reviewed to determine if they are technically acceptable (meet the Brand Name requirements)

Step 2 – Proposals considered to be technically acceptable will be evaluated regarding their proposed delivery schedule and price (NOTE:  Delivery schedule is more important than price) 

Step 3 – Vendors considered for award will be notified via ITSS (NOTEs:  1- All awards will be subject to the funds available for each CLIN; 2 - All vendors must be registered in ITSS and CCR to be considered for award).

Example:

		Step 1	                                       Step 2                
Vendor A        technically acceptable                price acceptable         
Vendor B        technically un-acceptable 
Vendor C        technically acceptable                price un-acceptable 
Vendor D        technically acceptable                price acceptable         

In the example above only Vendors A and D would be considered as potential for award.  The Government reserves the right to acquire anywhere from 0 to the number required from any vendor considered to be technically acceptable and have an acceptable delivery schedule for the price.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis/solicitation is identified as FDA-SOL-06-00261.  It is the government’s intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Kinetic Systems Inc., 20 Arboretum Road, Boston, MA 02131 for the following items:   See attached item list and product specifications.  There is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  GSA has already equipped certain areas of the building with KSI equipment.  For purposes of obtaining cost-effective maintenance and adjustment services in the future, FDA requires a single vendor for all vibration isolation equipment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any interested parties shall submit a response to the point of contact by 4 P.M. EST, Tuesday, July 25, 2006.
