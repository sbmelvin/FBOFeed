By October 1, 2003, a vendor must be registered in the CCR in order to receive contracts and purchase orders from most federal agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  CCR is a self-service database.  Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.  To register or learn more about the CCR, go to:  www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey, Western Region, Geologic Discipline has a requirement for data transcription services. The USGS requires services to copy and reformat geophysical seismic reflection profile data currently on nine-track tape (800, 1600, and 6250 bpi) to disc images, and deliver the resulting output on high-density media (DVD or DLT tape).  Upon confirmation of data delivery, the contractor must dispose of the original nine-track tape.  The nine-track tapes are written in a variety of formats unique to the geophysical industry.  All output data files will be written in the SEG-Y (rev 0).  The SEG-Y format is described at:  http://seg.org/publications/tech-stand/seg_y_rev0.pdf  The contractor must supply digital (ASCII) logs of transcription statistics and records of all read errors (parity, short record, etc.) that occurred during input.   In general, the SEG-B field tapes and demultiplexed tapes are written the entire 2400-foot length, while the stack tapes have varying amounts of data, from 5% to 100% of capacity.  The DLT tar output must be organized according to survey or area identifiers. An unknown portion of the tapes suffer from "stiction", or stidky tape syndrome.  The contractor must be able to treat and read these tapes with at least an 80% recovery.  The tapes will be delivered to the contractor by the government on a schedule agreeable to both parties.  Data tapes will be delivered in lots of 200 to 500 tapes at a time. Estimated quantities are as follows: 5,000 SEG-B field tapes; 1,000 sort tapes; and 1,000 stack tapes.  Evaluation factors include: Past performance and prior experience reading and copying nine-track data tapes containing seismic reflection profile data; facilities and experience for handling "sticky" tapes; proximity to Houston, TX tape storage facilities; and price. Anticipated contract term is one year plus two one-year option periods.  Anticipated contract type is a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity.  Multiple contracts may be awarded.  The RFP will be issued on the NBC website but proposals must be submitted to the address to be shown on the RFP.  Anticipated date for issuance of the RFP is July 7, 2003.  The closing date for responses is anticipated to be August 7, 2003.  Send written questions to the contracting officer, rleach@usgs.gov.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of AeraLib Library software maintenance support. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the support from Aerospace Engineering & Research, Inc. who is the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements. The AeraLib Software Library provides functionality for the study and analysis of current and future airspace structures, Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems and Air Traffic Control (ATC) concepts. The AeraLib software maintenance support is available only through the software developer, Aerospace Engineering. The renewal of the annual maintenance agreement is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released; access to technical support; prompt notification of bugs, and new documentation as it is published. It would take substantial duplication of time an money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these      costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.	The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 3, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The objective of the proposed eighteen-month program is to provide reliable heating systems and lavatories to improve the conditions in the Armenian schools. Assistance will be provided to targeted schools countrywide. The list of the targeted schools will be provided in the RFP.
The program has the following two major interrelated components targeted at improving the social and health services for the students of the targeted schools:
1.	Rehabilitation/Construction of the school heating systems. 
The contractor is expected to design and construct heating system for each school based on the local technical conditions (availability of natural gas supply, old boiler house, etc.). In case the natural gas supply will not be available to the school the contractor should design and install a heating system equipped with liquid fuel or other fossil fuel fired burners.
2.	Rehabilitation/Renovation of school lavatories. 
Inside lavatories will have to be renovated in those schools that have built-in sewage system. However, there are a number of schools that do not have a built-in sewerage system. In those cases the contractor will have to install toilet facilities outside of the school building and connect them to the closest sewage system.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development Mission in Peru (USAID/Peru) is seeking proposals from qualified institutions to be the lead management and implementation contractor under a four-year cost plus award fee contract in support of the Alternative Development Program (ADP).  The ADP is a major component of the U.S. and Peruvian Governments counter-narcotics strategy to eliminate all illicit coca in Peru by 2007.  The contractor will have lead responsibility for ensuring that coca leaf eradication performed by farmers (auto-eradication) meets annual targets, for leading a communications strategy geared to providing timely information about the ADP to multiple audiences and to creating a permanent change in behavior by former coca farm families, and for monitoring and reporting on overall development activities tied to auto-eradication.  They will also have the lead responsibility for coordinating information from several sector-specific interventions (e.g., democracy, business investment, health, education, resources management) implemented by other organizations supporting the ADP with longer-term, sustainable development programs.  Offerors proposals must show solid experience working with alternative development programs in Latin America under circumstances that can be confrontational and influenced by narcotics trafficking and political unrest.  Of high importance is the ability to field senior personnel with experience in managing a complex, multi-sector, rural alternative development program subject to changing and unpredictable challenges.  The contractor will have a short overlap period with the incumbent contractor, whose current 18-month contract terminates at the end of March 2004.  The contractor will be expected to take over the responsibilities and commitments of the incumbent without a pause in operations and with an intense focus on achieving results.

HITS currently provides inter and intra base switched services, dedicated transmission services, network management, and administrative operation and maintenance of a leased switch network.  The scope of the JHITS will be essentially the same as the current HITS contract; however, the structure of the resultant contract and the methodology by which the successful offeror will provision services under JHITS will be significantly different than the current HITS structure.  A one-day industry conference has been scheduled for 19 August 2003, in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The conference will outline the major structural and methodology changes embodied in the JHITS acquisition, the impact of other DISA and Armed Forces Information Technology contracts on JHITS services, and the proposed JHITS acquisition schedule.  The specific conference location has not been finalized.  There will be a subsequent posting providing detailed information within the next several weeks.  Interested parties are invited to reply to this announcement.  This does not constitute a registration; however, it will assist the government in determining the approximate size of the required facility.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Team is interested in stimulating research to dramatically reduce aerospace vehicle systems life-cycle costs, accelerate development of new systems with architectures, tools, and processes that allow easy technology upgrade and insertion.  This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) of Texas A&M University System; 332 Werc Building, College Station, TX 77843-3000, on an other than full and open competitive basis.  TEES has been identified as the only responsible source capable of meeting the Governments requirements because of its unique organizational structure.  The Aerospace Vehicle Systems Institute (AVSI) is a cooperative venture of aerospace companies for the aerospace industry and is a research center of the TEES.  In addition, no other similar consortium of this unique type has been found through a review of other aerospace research consortiums, associations, and organizations.  Currently, there are no other known consortiums, which could compete in the breadth of application research and cost-sharing research activities offered by TEES.  The proposed action will be issued as a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) with at least a 50/50 cost share contribution from TEES and the Government respectively.  Award is anticipated to be as soon as possible after this synopsis/announcement date.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in response to this notice.  Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Contracts shall consider responses.  Responses without a return address, mailing address and company telephone number will not be recognized.  Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated.  NOTE:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.  Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or by accessing the CCR web site at http://ccr.gov/.  Responses to this synopsis should be sent via email to SeymourVA@navair.navy.mil SEE NOTE 22

The U.S. EPA believes that TSI Incorporated is the only known U.S. provider of a submicrometer aerosol generator that produces a monodisperse aerosol from a polydisperse aerosol using electrical mobility as the selection criteria to the following specifications: The particle size range is adjustable from 0.005 to 1.0 micrometers.  The input polydisperse aerosol concentration range varies from 10 to the -3 power to 10 to the 8 power particles/per cubic centimeter.  The monodisperse particles produced have a mean mobility of plus or minus 5 percent and a mean size for singly charged particles of plus or minus 5 percent. The electrostatic classifier component of the aerosol system is microprocessor controlled and can be paired with differential mobility analyzers (DMAs).  The condensation particle counter provides an upper aerosol concentration limit of 10 to the 7 power particles/per cubic centimeter, containing a built-in pumping system with automatic volumetric flow control with a concentration accuracy of plus or minus 10 percent, and a coincidence value less than 2 percent.  The powder disperser provides 0.3 to 40 miligram per cubic meter of dry polystyrene latex sphere (PSL) aerosol by aspiration and deagglomeration from a pre-manufactured source in a range from 1 to 50 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter.  The dry PSL aerosol can be a single size or multiple sizes combined. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<SUBJECT>B -- Intertemporal General Equilibrium Health Care Model
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-31007
<RESPDATE>080403
<ARCHDATE>08192003
<CONTACT>Andy Mummert, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-0403, Fax 410-786-9088, Email AMummert@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intend to contract on a sole source basis with Capital Research Associates for the development of a long-term, dynamic general equilibrium interindustry model with a detailed description of the health sector.  This is not a solicitation.  This is a notice of intent to contract with Capital Research Associates.  CMS is using the exception to full and open competition described in FAR 6.302-1 to procure this model. This model will greatly expand the analytical capabilities of the Office of the Actuary (OACT) in producing annual projections of the National Health Accounts, in evaluating and projecting the effects of proposed legislation, and in the 75-year projections of Medicare expenditures produced annually by OACT for the Medicare Trustees Report.
The proposed model will be an enhanced and augmented model that updates and builds on two existing models.   The model will incorporate an updated version of the detailed health sector model of the Macroeconomic-Demographic Model of Health Care and Consumer Expenditures (MDM).  This model was originally developed by Joseph Anderson, Dale Jorgenson, John Moeller, and Daniel Sleznick for the National Institute on Aging and provides a detailed representation of health care demand based on linked cross-sectional time-series data.   The health sector specification from the MDM Model will be estimated within a much more complex general equilibrium model of production based on the Intertemporal General Equilibrium Model (IGEM) originally developed by Dale Jorgenson and others at Harvard University, and with the addition of a separate production model for the health sector.   The proposed model will give the Office of the Actuary (OACT) at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS, formerly HCFA) a greatly enhanced ability to analyze trends in Medicare, Medicaid, and the entire health sector within the context of the economic system.    This is critical for both relatively short-term projections required for policy analysis, as well as the 75-year projections required for the Medicare Trustees Report.  This model has three broad applications:  1) The production of comprehensive projections of the National Health Accounts (NHA) that address implications of relevant public and private sector developments in the health sector, 
2) The analysis and projection of the outcome of alternative policy options for Medicare, Medicaid, and for the regulation of markets for private health care, 3) The evaluation of implications of demographic and economic assumptions for annual 75-year projections of Medicare incorporated in the Medicare Trustees Report.    
In each case, the proposed model would expand both the range of issues that could be evaluated by  OACT, and greatly increase the detail and depth of the analysis that would be possible.  
This model is also intended to replace the current NHSG National Health Expenditures 10-Year Projections Model, which is currently estimated on a partial equilibrium basis using highly aggregated data.   The current model does not adequately allow for the analysis of purchases of medical care across cohorts with differing health status, income, demographic, geographic characteristics, and differing health coverage.     This capability is essential for the evaluation of critical developments (e.g. the rise in the uninsured population, the effect of changes in the structure of coverage for different populations, demographic and distributional implications of policy alternatives). 
The critical capabilities to be developed in the proposed model can be grouped in two broad areas:  
First, development of detailed representation of inter-industry flows within the context of a general equilibrium model.    The Jorgenson IGEM model is an endogenous growth model which is econometrically estimated based on a recently updated (2002) database of inputs to production across 37 industry sectors.   The adaptation of this model will involve the estimation of the model with a separate health sector (currently included in a much larger Other Services industry category), the aggregation of industry detail where not required, and the incorporation of the more detailed model of consumer demand for health care from the MDM.   This will require the development of time-series data for inputs to health care production on a basis comparable to the existing data, and the re-estimation of the model on the basis of the revised specification.   For this expansion of the model to include a separate health sector, a careful evaluation of the effects of known flaws in available data for medical price inflation and capital services inputs will be required.       
A dynamic general equilibrium interindustry model will allow the simulation of change in the health sector within the context of the economy as a whole:  how shifting resources of capital and labor affects productivity growth in health and non-health sectors, how relative growth in productivity affects relative prices and aggregate growth in output and income, and how these changes can be expected to feed back into the consumer decision-making process.    
Second, development of the proposed model of consumer demand for health care that will be a detailed representation of consumer demand for health care based on household survey data.  The model will be estimated on the basis of a micro-level database including detailed information on individual household purchases of medical care within the context of effective price paid by consumers, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics price, age, gender, family size, health status, income, geographic location, and characteristics of insurance coverage (private employer based, non-employer based, indemnity, managed care, Medicare, Medicaid). 
Based on this data, the existing MDM model provides a detailed representation of complex process involved in purchasing medical care.   The model of health demand structure represents consumer demand as a three-stage decision-making process that results ultimately in realized demand for health care.   First, consumers select an insurance status (on the basis of price and expected outlays with and without insurance, health status, and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.   Second, consumers allocate income across health and non-health goods, conditional on insurance status.   Lastly, consumers allocate health care purchases by type (hospital, physician, drugs, etc.)     
The estimation of the model of health care demand based on data for individual households will create the capability to evaluate a range of key issues where critical details are masked by aggregation.   Such issues includes the determination of the share of the population with medical insurance, the impact of institutional change (e.g. managed care in the private or public sector), the response of consumers to changes in the structure of insurance coverage (e.g. changes in the structure of copayments and deductibles), and the distributional impact of changes in regulation and policy across households of different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and by nature of insurance coverage.   It is imperative that the OACT have access to a model with the capability to estimate the effect of such developments.
As with the macroeconomic model, the estimation of the model of health demand based on the original work completed for the MDM will imply great efficiencies in the design and estimation of the model.   Two sorts of modifications are intended.   First, the original MDM model database incorporated a single cross-sectional household survey (the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey) adjusted for consistency and linked to time-series data from the National Health Accounts.  Data should be pooled across several survey databases, adjusting each for consistency with the others and with the National Health Accounts.   These databases include the 1977 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMCES), the 1987 National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES), and the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) for 1996 and later years.   Using cross-section and panel data collected ten years apart will permit estimation of trends in insurance and payment institutions and aggregate income and price effects.    
Second, the theoretical design of the original MDM model will be expanded and adjusted.   The insurance options to allow a choice of type of insurance coverage as well as insured/uninsured will be expanded.   An expanded and augmented insurance/payment choice model will facilitate the modeling of institutional change.  Time trend parameters could be estimated and adjusted to depict alternative trends in third party payment and health care decision institutions.  Exogenous adjustment in the allocation equations could be made to simulate alternative institutional changes.  Both the probability (proportion) of households in various insurance coverage/managed care categories, and the out-of-pocket prices they face, given insurance coverage type, may be modified to simulate alternative institutional change scenarios.  It may be possible to use auxiliary data bases with cross-section and time series data on managed care trends and trends in participation in various payment arrangements to estimate equations capturing trends in institutional arrangements.    This expansion will enable the evaluation of the effects of the expansion of institutional change (particularly where associated with managed care relative to traditional fee-for-service coverage).    The link between insurance coverage and employment will also be explored.   
The model of health/non-health allocation will also be modified.  Insurance coverage and third party payment equations will be estimated using specifications that capture the role of aggregate income and lagged income effects and aggregate health care price and lagged price effects.  The model will be estimated using pooled data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) and the 1996 and later Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).  Using cross-section and panel data collected ten years apart may permit estimation of trends in insurance and payment institutions and aggregate income and price effects.
A key function of OACTs National Health Statistics Group (NHSG) is to compile data, develop models, and conduct studies to estimate, project, and analyze the National Health Expenditures (NHE).  These estimates are used by a wide variety of analysts, public officials, and regulators, both in the public and private sectors.  It is imperative in the development of these models that the NHSG collaborate with modeling experts to ensure correct model specifications.   In addition to its applications in the projection of the NHE, this enhanced ability to produce detailed projections for the NHE is critical for the evaluation of near-term policy proposals, and longterm projections of Medicare.   As part of its mission, OACT is required to produce spending projections associated with a wide range of specific policy proposals from the administration and legislators and others.   These analyses are used for determining policy, analyzing trends, responding to inquiries and proposals from regulators and public officials, and general economic research.  In order to adequately perform this analysis, OACT must have the ability to model consumption and production of health care at a detailed level, and to evaluate the interactions between the health sector and other sectors in the economy.  The capabilities of this model will also be critical for the analysis of long-term projections of the entire health sector and for public programs in this context.   OACT is required annually to produce the Medicare Trustees Reports, projecting the 75-year future of Medicare revenues and costs.   The comprehensive evaluation, both of projections of the effects of policy proposals over a five to ten year horizon, and the analysis of the dynamics of growth in Medicare spending within the context of the health sector as a whole, requires a model that offers a more detailed representation of health sector decision-making than current OACT models allow.    A micro-level database with additional years of survey data will improve our ability to estimate the effects of major changes in Federal and state legislation introduced over the period since 1977.   These include, for example, the introduction of Medicares inpatient Prospective Payment System (PPS) in 1983.   This capability is particularly critical for the evaluation of Medicare Projections for the Medicare Trustees Report.   These projections must be produced on a current-law basis.   This requires that we estimate the impact of historical changes in legislation.   The ability to evaluate the impact of such changes on patterns of household spending over time will provide a much enhanced basis for such current-law projections of Medicare spending.  
The growing size of the Medicare, and of the health sector relative to the economy implies that feedback effects between health sector and macroeconomic trends are of increasing importance.   A comprehensive projection requires that health  within the framework of a general equilibrium model.    This is particularly critical for infinite horizon projections, where the health sector may (under some assumptions) dominate the entire economy.    
An evaluation of such feedback effects is important for the projection of Medicare revenues and costs in the annual Trustees Reports.    These projections are based on short-term and long-term economic and demographic assumptions developed by the Board of Trustees.  In order for OACT to produce timely, impartial, and authoritative estimates in the report, the Office must have a comprehensive understanding of the impact of these assumptions on the health sector.  This level of analysis requires a detailed micro-based health sector model, within a general equilibrium interindustry macroeconomic model.  Under this contract, the contractor shall perform the following tasks:  I.  Model Development:  Modify the theoretical foundations of the MDM and the IGEM to meet CMS needs.  The estimation of the IGEHM will involve the integration of the modified MDM with the modified IGEM.   Therefore the Tasks under A and B below must be performed on a parallel track.

<DESC>POC:  James Perretta, AFRL/SNRT Program Manager, telephone: 315-330-2632; e-mail: James.Perretta@rl.af.mil.  Contracting Officer, Arnold J. Kloven, AFRL/IFKA, telephone:  315-330-4767; e-mail:  Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  The AFRL Sensors Directorate at Rome Research Site is soliciting proposals for various studies, capabilities and experiments which bring together enabling technology base and system concepts at a combined state-of-the-art level greater than currently available.  The desired overall result is to identify technologies and credible enabling system concepts considering non-traditional RF technologies that can be more fully explored in the early stages of potential new programs.  Resultant concepts and technology roadmaps may be presented to AFRL for possible inclusion in future programs.  This is a four (4) year Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit Research and Development (R & D) proposals for advanced RF networking techniques.  The following areas have been identified as important for developing high-capacity networking systems while integrating new and advanced technology:  Development of research and interaction between Government and industry to bring together both technology base and system concepts for advanced sensing and communication systems.  Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY03.  Individual awards will normally range from 1  12 months in duration with amounts normally ranging up to $500K per year.  Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $4 M.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2007.  At this time it is anticipated that up to ten (10) awards for $15K - $20K each, will be made for conducting research and presenting findings at a workshop on the subject of 60 GHz communication systems.  Each contract will have a period of performance of three (3) months.  Participation in the workshop will entail preparation of concepts, and technology roadmaps for candidate 60 GHz technologies.  The performers need to identify enabling technology and have a credible set of enabling system concepts that can be more fully explored in the early stages of a new start program.  This approach is essential for considering non-traditional RF technologies, such as quasi-optical, optical beam forming and two terminal devices.  Awardees will prepare concepts, objectives and technology roadmaps which will be presented at a workshop.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  Offerors are required to submit (3) copies of a two (2) to five (5) page proposal.  All proposals submitted in response to this PRDA must be addressed to:  AFRL/SNRT, ATTN:  James Perretta, Reference PRDA 03-14-IFKA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514.  A copy of the Rome "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  It is recommended that proposals for the initial FY03 awards be received by 30 Jun 03 to maximize the possibility of award.  Proposals will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available after the specified date.  Additional areas of interest and the dates for submission of proposals will be posted from time to time as requirements are identified.  All responsible firms may submit proposals which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-14-IFKA.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (a)  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal; (b)  The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, and (c)  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.  Also, consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA will be used.  No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  
Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572.  In addition, the work to be performed may require a secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, in those instances, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at time of award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment No. 1 is posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Please note that the date for receipt of proposals has been extended to June 30, 2003, at 3:00 p.m.

The Department of Commerce (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) requires ongoing scientific and technical support for its Office of Research and Applications (ORA) site in Camp Springs, MD.  ORA is the office within NESDIS that provides guidance for the development and evolution of spacecraft and sensors to meet future needs.  Through its divisions, ORA conducts atmospheric, climatic, and oceanographic research on the use of satellite data for monitoring environmental characteristics and their change.  ORA plans, coordinates, and conducts research and development activities with other parts of NESDIS and NOAA and other Government agencies, universities and international groups.  ORA provides meteorological and oceanographic satellite products and services to users world-wide. 

This requirement is for scientific support, often at the Ph.D. or Master's degree level, with experience in remote sensing and interpretation of satellite data for weather, ocean and climate systems.  The Contractor shall provide scientific support for the design, development, testing, implementation, validation and documentation of algorithms for deriving atmospheric, oceanic and land surface variables from research and operational satellite observations.  This support shall involve occasional participation in field experiments including those on ships and aircraft platforms.  The Contractor shall participate in technical conferences where the results of this research are presented.  These services are currently performed by a staff of physical scientists including  meteorologists, oceanographers, hydrologists, physicists, engineers, mathematicians, programmers and system analysts.

This is a competitive 8(a) requirement.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690 applies.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541690 is $6.0 million.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DK-02-0151
<RESPDATE>072103

<DESC>Collaboration in scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients in the areas of cellular and genetic aspects of liver regeneration; liver function and metabolic mass;  markers of liver injury and repair; treatment of hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer); immunosuppression and  immune tolerance; drug metabolism; gene expression; psychometric measures of quality of life; electronic media for patient education; and other scientific issues relevant to living donor liver transplantation.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies) to investigate scientific issues in the recently formed Clinical Research Network termed Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). The core theme of A2ALL is comparison of outcomes of candidates for liver transplant who receive or do not receive Living Donor Transplantation (LDT).  See http://www.nih-a2all.org/default.asp for more information and list of participating centers.  The potential Collaborators capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of the relevant area of investigation and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed methods, and access to potential therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Examples of potential studies include: 1) Characterization of changes in LIVER FUNCTION, mass, and metabolic capacity during regeneration following liver transplantation. The impact of changing liver function on the immune response as well as its effect on metabolism of immunosuppressants could be investigated using novel biochemical and imaging techniques.  2) Identification of host GENETIC FACTORS associated with LIVER REGENERATION and the syndrome of graft failure due to inadequate liver mass.  This will require the identification of genes involved in successful liver regeneration in humans, as well as pathophysiologic events in the failure of grafts. 3) Assessment of the interrelationship of LDT with IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.  Cylosporine, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive drugs have been associated with proliferative effects which impact liver regeneration. In addition, changes in liver function affect the pharmacokinetics of most immunosuppression.  4) Exploration of serum markers for LIVER INJURY and repair to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.  5) Evaluation of the impact of liver regeneration on the KINETICS OF VIRAL REPLICATION in subjects with HEPATITIS C, and the impact of INTERFERONS and other therapeutic molecules on these phenomena.  6)  Prevention of liver injury from recurrence of hepatitis C in LDT recipients by pre- and post-transplant TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C.  7)  Improved staging and treatment of HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.  8)  Develop GENE EXPRESSION ARRAYS that are diagnostic of liver regeneration and repair and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  9)  Study novel approaches to tolerance induction in a defined cohort of patients being prepared for elective transplantation from living donors.  10) Study the process of INFORMED UNDERSTANDING of living liver donors using ELECTRONIC MEDIA EDUCATION technology to provide patient information and correlate understanding with outcomes.  11) Development of effective PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS to evaluate the QUALITY OF LIFE effects of living donation in this cohort of patients who will be followed long term. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with LDT using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy patients undergoing liver transplantation and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a structured, prospective database on patients who are evaluated for LDT and either undergo LDT or instead, for various reasons, receive cadaveric livers or do not undergo transplantation at all.  Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all donors and recipients at pre-determined time points. 
Applicants to support this study must include a description of investigators and staff that would facilitate collaboration in multicenter clinical studies of liver transplant patients.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the methods and drugs which might be used.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine levels of target molecules or the genes encoding them along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  If an intervention is proposed, how the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the collaborators capability statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: 1) The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized and clearly describe important issues surrounding the proposed tests and technology. 2) The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the required materials or agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  3) The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of LDT, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development. 4) The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results.

DATES:  Only written capability statements received by NIDDK by close of business July 21, 2003, will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement may be invited at the Applicants own expense to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Studys Steering Committee in Washington D.C.

The Demo/Mines/Grenades Team is conducting a market survey of industry to identify contractors capable of manufacturing this item.  The MK75 Mod 0 Tubular Demolition Charge Kit contains a linear, hose-shaped explosive charge, which is used to clear natural and man-made obstructions from beaches, rivers and harbors.  The charge may be used under-water, in the s urf, or against land targets.  For towing and some water uses, the end of the charge may be plugged so that the air trapped within the charge causes it to be positively buoyant.  The charge may also be completely filled with water to achieve negative buoya ncy.  The charge is extruded from flexible explosive which is in accordance with MIL-E-46676.  A respondent to this survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance.  A respondent must h ave available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture the M75 Demo Charge.  Interested companies who feel they have the necessary manufacturing capabilities should respond by providing the government the following informati on; a brief summary of the company's capabilities, including a description of facilities, personnel, past manufacturing experience as it relates the the above criteria; estimated minimum and maximum monthly quantities that can be produced and the Minimum P rocurement Quantity (MPQ) required for production.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely manner.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or contractors, they must also meet this criteria.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an Invitation for Bid or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intent to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information.  The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop and maintain an acquisition strategy for futur e requirements.

<DESC>The VA National Acquisition Center (NAC) will be issuing its request for quotations for consolidated purchases of medical equipment under its existing indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contracts.  RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED ONLY FROM THOSE COMPANIES HAVING CONTRACTS WITH THE NAC DIRECT DELIVERY TEAM (medical equipment contracts numbered V797P-6xxxx).  Due to technical restrictions, the request is being divided over a series of Requests for Information (RFIs).  Each modality's RFI will contain the complete RFQ document, Schedule of Line Items, and Frequently Asked Questions document.  The attachments will only pertain to the type(s) of equipment advertised in that specific RFI.  Because of the extremely large volume of X-Ray/CR/DR systems, eleven RFIs will be issued for X-Ray.  They will be identified as Parts 1 through 11 (DD-FY03-02F through DD-FY03-02P).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking assistance from private sector individuals, firms, entities, and/or public agencies (non-federal) to assist them with the implementation of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). The purpose of EQIP is to promote agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible goals. The program provides assistance to producers to comply with local, state, and national regulatory requirements concerning soil, water, air, wildlife habitat, and surface and groundwater conservation. The program requires the agency to make eligibility determinations, rank eligible applicants, and develop a Long Term Agreement (LTA) for each successful applicant. To improve the program delivery to NRCS customers, the agency is seeking assistance within our USDA Service Centers. The field support needed is for the preparation of Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMP). 

The IN NRCS State Office is seeking the following EQIP related assistance: a. CNMP, including the three components of a CNMP; manure and wastewater handling, nutrient management and land treatment.  Manure and wastewater handling involves the evaluation of existing facilities and design of new facilities to handle and store manure and wastewater from livestock production operations and the assessment of and remediation plans for environmental risks associated with the livestock production facilities.  Nutrient management involves the allocation of nutrients from the livestock to cropland according to the NRCS Nutrient Management Standard 590.  Land treatment involves the assessment of the environmental risks and remediation plans for the land where manure will be applied. Through this Sources Sought Notice, the Indiana NRCS State Office is seeking potential private sector individuals, firms, entities, and/or
public agencies (non-federal) to provide this assistance in cooperation with the agency. The successful applicants for Comprehensive Nutrient Management Planning must be certified through the Tech Reg website at http://techreg.usda.gov to prepare CNMPs in Indiana.  If you believe that you can furnish the desired assistance for CNMP planning, you are encouraged to give written notice to the Contracting Officer identified below. Successful applicants may be required to provide additional proof of licensing, certification(s), and bonding for contracted activities. If an individual, firm, entity, and/or public agency (non-federal) wish to provide this assistance, they are encouraged to state this in their response to this solicitation. This project will be Performance Based with minimal specifications and drawings. Proposals from contractors will be evaluated on Technical Capability, Personnel Qualifications, Past Performance and Price. This is a "Sources Sought Notice". A separate "Request for Proposal" will be advertised for each of the four NRCS administrative areas in Indiana as soon as funding becomes available and surplus workload areas are identified.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking sources capable of conducting clinical trials on the use of sodium nitroprusside to maintain controlled hypotension in pediatric patients undergoing surgical procedures.  It is expected that these studies will involve multiple sites.  Established pediatric drug trials networks or offerors that include multiple sites are encouraged to respond.  Sodium nitroprusside  is commonly used for  maintaining periods of hypotension during pediatric surgical procedures.  However, there is limited information available about dosing, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety in pediatric patients who are maintained in states of controlled hypotension for either short or long periods.  The NICHD plans to conduct studies of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, and dosing in pediatric patients requiring periods of controlled hypotension using randomized, observer-blinded approaches.  Investigators will recruit a broad spectrum of patients who require periods of controlled hypotension.  It is anticipated that 200 patients will be required to complete the studies.  Interested organizations shall provide a brief statement of capabilities not to exceed 10 pages that includes past experience in conducting clinical drug trials in pediatric populations and access to and ability to recruit the necessary patient population, that is, children undergoing surgical procedures in which hypotension is induced and maintained by an infusion of sodium nitroprusside.  Also include qualifications and experience of the proposed personnel in the conduct of similar types of clinical research; evidence of previous experience in similar pediatric clinical trials, including clinical trials requiring a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and studies leading to pediatric labeling; numbers of patients enrolled and retained in pediatric clinical trials (past and present); procedures and mechanisms for facilitating referral and enrollment of pediatric patients undergoing periods of controlled hypotension;  access to target populations (newborns, toddlers; preschool children; school-age children; and adolescents requiring periods of controlled hypotension) demonstrated by recruitment in previous clinical trials or current clinical populations;  access to ethnic and racial minority pediatric populations requiring controlled hypotension;  evidence of number of patients requiring controlled hypotension that will be available to receive infusions of sodium nitropruside.  Also provide documentation of all clinical and laboratory facilities and equipment;  clinic and clinical trials site space description;  pharmacy capability, i.e., storage area, staff availability, and quality control plan.  Please send original plus four copies  of your capabilities statement to:  Mrs. Mya N. Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 EXECUTIVE Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852) on or before July 10, 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- Adaptable Radiation Area Monitor (ARAM)
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE THE ADAPTABLE RADIATION AREA MONITOR, (ARAM)

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's the Adaptable Radiation Area Monitor, ARAM.

Scientists at LLNL have invented ARAM, the Adaptable Radiation Area Monitor. This technology consists of a novel radiation detection system, using primarily commercially available hardware along with proprietary software developed at LLNL. ARAM is a system that has been developed with modularity as a design feature to allow it to be adapted easily to a large number of applications. Potential uses of the invention are radiation detection in large open areas, portal monitor type areas, and high-speed roadways.

ARAM prototypes have been developed and have been field tested in many environments. ARAM is capable of detecting small quantities of radioactive materials moving at highway speeds (dynamic portal monitor). ARAM can also be used as a package monitor or a vehicle/personnel portal monitor. ARAM can be used as a standalone monitor or networked with other systems.

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U. S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. The University of Californias Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or non-exclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's ARAM technology should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>A -- Forward Error Correction Method for Use on Free-Space Optical Communications Networks
<DESC>LLNL SEEKS INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS TO COMMERCIALIZE A FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION DEVICE FOR USE ON FREE-SPACE OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS 

Announcement: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to manufacture and market a forward error correction (FEC) device for use on free-space optical (FSO) laser communications networks. The device, developed at LLNL, has demonstrated the ability to mitigate the frequent and severe loss of signal that occurs due to atmospheric fading and beam pointing jitter. Fade durations on the order of 10 ms can be perfectly corrected and data speeds of at least 2.5 Gbps can be handled. Commercial applications include FSO links for last mile network connections. Military applications include long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground FSO links for tactical and reconnaissance missions.

The successful industrial partner will be responsible for the detailed design, fabrication, testing, and manufacturing of the FEC device, requiring the following capabilities: Digital simulation and verification at the system level, high-speed digital design up to 2.5 GHz, incorporation of commercial FEC cores supplied in VHDL, implementation in FPGAs or ASICs, circuit board layout and fabrication, packaging, and electrical testing. LLNL will provide technical guidance in this cooperative partnership.

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market.

<SUBJECT>--SOURCES SOUGHT for acquisiton of management support services under the TEAMS (TRICARE Evaluation, Analysis, and Management Support) Program.
<DESC>NA TRICARE Evaluation, Analysis, and Management Support (TEAMS) Contracting Office Address Defense Contracting Command - Washington,  Supporting OSD Health Affairs and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) 5109 Leesburg Pike, Skyline Six, Suite 401A Falls Church, VA  22041 Contract Specialist: Cindy Durling Contract Specialist: Pat Whitenton Description The Defense Contracting Command-Washington, on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD (HA), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), is seeking expressions of interest in the acquisition of management support services  under the TEAMS (TRICARE Evaluation, Analysis, and Management Support) Program.   TEAMS represents a opportunity to compete for the award of multiple contracts that will replace the present Program Management and Integration (PMI II BPAs) and the Defense Medical Information and Management/Design, Development, Operations, and Maintenance  Services II  Technical Studies and Analyses  (D/SIDDOMS II, Lot I) contracts.   For information regarding the scope of the current PMI II BPAs or D/SIDDOMS II Lot I vehicles, please refer to the web page for TRICARE contracts at:  http://www.tricare.osd.mil/contracting/otherservices/index.cfm?fx=contracts  The competition for the award of the TEAMS contracts will be conducted under full and open procedures; however, the contracting officer reserves the right to set-aside awards to small businesses.  Work will be performed in accordance with performance-based  work statements under delivery orders issued against indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contracts.  The term of each contract will be for a base year, options for four additional years, and award term options for five more years of performance, brin ging the possible term of each contract to a total of ten years.  TMA has categorized all its non-purchased care requirements into three broad  categories, as defined below, for purposes of identifying, avoiding or mitigating  against Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs) in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.5.  These categories are defined as follows: 	Category 1:  TMA Internal Support:  Services which, by their very nature, give the Contractor access to extensive data about the contracts of all other TMA contractors. 	Category 2:  Program Management Support:  Services which assist TMA in planning and managing its activities and programs.  This includes, for example:  requirements analysis, acquisition support, budget planning and management, business process reengi neering, program planning and execution support, and independent technical management support. 	Category 3:  Product Support.  Services or end items required to meet the mission requirements of TMAs non-purchased care activities and programs.  This includes, for example:  concept exploration and development; system design; system developme nt and integration; COTS Procurement and integration; internal development testing; deployment; installation; operations; and maintenance. TEAMS is a category 2 requirement. Contractor participation in more than one of these areas may give rise to an unfair competitive advantage resulting from access to advance acquisition planning, source selection sensitive or proprietary information.  Furthermore, contractor participation i n more than one area may give rise to a real or apparent loss of contractor impartiality and objectivity whereas its advisory or planning assistance in one area potentially affects its present or future participation in another area. The purpose of this categorization is to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) to inform prospective offerors that TMA presumes that award of a contract or order in the subject category will give rise to real or apparent OCIs with respect to requi rements in the other two categories; (2) to assist current contractors and prospective offerors in developing their own busines s strategies regarding participation in TMA requirements and in identifying and, where possible, avoiding or mitigating against OCIs; and (3) to ensure that all current contractors and prospective offerors are afforded the maximum practicable opportunity t o compete for all TMA requirements consistent with the restrictions required under FAR Subpart 9.5 and sound business practices. For purposes of identifying, avoiding and / or mitigating against OCIs, TMA will examine all its non-purchased care requirements and acquisitions regardless of the cognizant contracting activity (e.g., DCC-W, GSA, VA, etc.) or the type of contract vehicle used (e.g., FSS order, Fair Opportunity competitive order under Multiple Award IDIQ Contracts, competitively negotiated awards under FAR Part 15, etc.).  Each TMA non-purchased care solicitation will therefore be designated as falling within one of the thr ee above defined categories.  The TEAMS Request for Proposals (RFP) is targeted for release by early Fiscal Year 2004.  Questions concerning the composition and requirements of the RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under TEAMS contracts, will no t be entertained at this time.  Offerors will be given ample opportunity to formally submit questions after the RFP has been released.  This announcement is an opportunity for those firms that are interested in participating in the TEAMS procurement to identify themselves. Such firms should submit a written declaration of interest to the following point of contact and should identify a poi nt of contact, an e-mail address, and a mailing address for the firm.  Telephone calls, e-mails, and personal visits related to TEAMS will not be acknowledged or entertained. No contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for any information or action forwarded in response t o this announcement.

The integrated AUV system must be turnkey and meet the following specifications; The AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small (less than 0.324 m in diameter and 2.5 m in length), and light (less than 100 kg in air).  The AUV must be able to swim at speeds from 2 to over 10 knots and have a mission duration in excess of 20 hours swimming at 2.2 kts and 6 hours swimming at 5 kts while powered by lead-acid gel cell batteries.  The AUV must be able to control speed to within 0.5% of the target speed, hold course to within 1 degree of the planned bearing, and hold depth to an accuracy of  2.5 cm.  The AUV must be able to accurately execute missions in excess of 40 n.mi. Completely autonomously.  The AUV must be powered by lead-acid batteries.  The battery packs must be easily changeable for rapid redeployment of the AUV and must also be rechargeable while installed in the AUV and when removed from the AUV.  A suitable battery charger is to be provided that can completely charge a battery pack in less than six hours.  At least two recharchable battery packs must be provided with the AUV.   Additionally, alkaline battery packs must be a provided option and allow missions exceeding 96 hours at 2.2 kts.
The AUV must include fisheries instrumentation including a single-frequency 38 kHz split-beam scientific echo sounder (eg. Simrad EK60) and transducer with 12 degree or narrower beam width (e.g. Simrad ES38-12), a 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (eg. RDI Workhorse), a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor (e.g. Seabird SBE 37si MicroCat), and a stereo digital color still or video camera system (eg. twin Sony DSC U20).  Alternative instrumentation with equivalent or superior specifications may be substituted with consent of the government.
The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly or entirely of commercial off-the-shelf components.  All of the source codes for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is desirable.  The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings.  The vehicle must accommodate a modular payload of up to 1 m in length, 0.324 m in diameter, and 25 kg weight, and associated vehicle lengthening, without appreciable reductions in the operational speed and duration.  The aforementioned fisheries specific equipment can be included in this payload.  The AUV must have a maximum operational depth of at least 150 m (preferably 300m).  The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6C to 35C and remain unharmed for storage and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10C to 45C.  The AUV must be tolerant of icing and thermal shock encountered when deploying in Polar Regions.  A 10/100 Ethernet connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector.  A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation.  The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer located greater than 1 n.mi. away.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data to the remote computer.  The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.  When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates.
While the AUV is at the surface, geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential GPS. The AUV must be able to acquire GPS updates in sea states up to Beaufort 5. Acoustic Doppler estimates of velocities are to be used for estimating and compensating for vehicle set and drift by currents.  Heading information must be provided by a flux-gate or gyro compass; depth is to be monitored by a pressure sensor; height over the seafloor is to be monitored by an acoustic altimeter; and propeller rotation rate is to be monitored using a Hall effect tachometer.  The AUV package must include rugged shipping containers for all components.  The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship.  The AUV package must include an expendable items spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV components.  A list of part numbers and pricing must be included for all custom AUV components.   3.0 PRE-AWARD AUV DEMONSTRATIONS: Demonstrations must be organized and conducted by the candidate Contractor, in coordination with the government representatives.

ADD: IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY

The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION

(a) Owner agrees that U.S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U.S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel on the boarding party.

(b) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to such United States Armed Forces boarding party with respect to the identification of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel, and to permit the United States Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(c) Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer, or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly so as not to delay prosecution of the voyage, and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear reasonable costs incurred by the Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(d) Owner understands and agrees that members of and equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the United States of America will be embarked aboard the vessel during the period of the Charter.  Charterer reserves the right, at Charterers sole option, to embark additional armed U.S. Armed Forces members, for the purposes of protection of the U.S. Armed Forces members responsible for the equipment as well as the equipment belonging to the U.S. Armed Forces.  These additional force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by U.S. Military Authorities, and will operate under the command of competent U.S. Military Authorities. Charterer agrees to reimburse the Owner of cost of such additional personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargoes. Owner agrees to provide sufficient life saving equipment for up to 12 additional personnel in accordance with SOLAS and all applicable regulatory requirements.
