<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 687th Armament Systems Squadron is planning to award a sole source contract to The Boeing Company, Directed Energy Systems, 8531 Fallbrook Ave, West Hills, CA, 91304-3232.  The 687 ARSS requires services to operate, maintain, and repair residual hardware from the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, located at Kirtland AFB, NM, and to conduct an Extended User Evaluation (EUE) of the prototype system.  The Government does not own drawings, software documentation, operating procedures, or component specifications for this highly complex, proprietary, prototype system.  Therefore, it is envisioned that the only suitable contractor for this effort is the incumbent. The contract for this effort will be awarded not later than 30 Sep 2008.

The contractor will be expected to prepare the ATL system for high-power laser operations on the ground and for flight operations approximately 8 times per year.  A commensurate level of systems engineering, design, and program management support, including system safety, will be required to operate, maintain, and repair the system in a timely manner to support the required operations.

An indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract is anticipated with firm-fixed price and time and material task orders.  It is estimated that the total contract period of performance will not exceed three (3) years from time of award.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the points of contact identified below.  The AAC Ombudsman is BGen Michael N. Wilson, AAC/CV, (850) 882-5422, or michael.wilson2@eglin.af.mil.  For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Dr. Charlie Helms, (850) 883-3215 or e-mail charles.helms@eglin.af.mil or Maj Scott Foreman, (850) 882-0314 or e-mail scott.foreman@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>This project includes all work associated with replacing the roof at the Air Traffic Control Tower Base Building, Lambert International Airport, St. Louis, Missouri.
The overall project consists of, but is not limited to, the following:
1.	Work covers the installation of a new Firestone Platinum Roofing System on the Federal Aviation Administration Air traffic Control Tower facility base building at Lambert International Airport.  In addition, the contractor shall include all related items of work as noted herein or indicated on the drawings or otherwise required to complete the specified elements of work and provide the requested warranties for this work.
2.	Remove and salvage the existing lightning protection conductors and terminals and reinstall following replacement of the roof in a manner to match the existing installation methods and locations.  Remove concrete pavers and store for re-use after the installation of the new membrane.  Remove the existing parapet wall preformed metal coping and counter flashing (at tower wall).

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Sections 3.2.1.3.12 and 3.2.2.4.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to issue a small business contract to Architecture Technology Corporation of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. This is a Bridge Contract with a 12 month Base year and 6 month option period with a total estimated value of  $1.3 Million. A competitive procurement will be initiated in 12 months.  This bridge contract provides systems engineering and support services in support of the Runway Incursion Reduction Program (RIRP). Requirements are to install, integrate and test runway safety technologies and conduct operational evaluations of these technologies at specified airports in the NAS. Specifically, the RIRP will procure and install Low Cost Ground Surveillance (LCGS) systems at up to 6 airports during fiscal year 2009 in order to evaluate their technical performance and narrow FAA investment alternatives for a national deployment program. Additionally, the RIRP is in the process of expanding the Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) test bed to include Runway Status Lights (RWSL) on the east airfield runways and the addition of the enhanced Final Approach Runway Occupancy Signal (eFAROS) prototype.  Finally, the FAA is required by Congressional direction to evaluate a runway safety technology - the Runway Occupancy Warning System (ROWS) proposed for evaluation at the Gulfport, Biloxi Airport.  
Architecture Technology Corporation (AT Corp) is uniquely qualified to perform the work required under the proposed contract on the basis of unique products and specialized expertise currently at hand.  In particular, AT Corp developed, under SBIR N96-093 (Phase I and II), a Reconfigurable Interface Simulation/Stimulation Tool (RISST) that is being adapted for reuse on LCGS and RWSL system integration and test activities under this contract.  The FAA requires performance and delivery of products that rely on adaptation and use of this tool beginning in June 2008.  They are performing similar work in support of RWSL and LCGS under the precursor contract and in the course of that work have assembled test equipment and prototyped hardware and software for use in performing tasks on the aforementioned projects.  They have also cultivated specialized expertise in designing and adapting these tools and prototype equipment.  
This is not a request for proposal synopsis nor is the FAA seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with replies to this announcement. This announcement is prepared for informational purposes only. Inquiries relative to this public announcement are to be submitted in writing. They should be addressed to the Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, DC 20591, ATTN: Stephen M. Bobby Contracting Officer ASU-330, steven.bobby@faa.gov .

<a href="mailto:diana.pickel@faa.gov">diana.pickel@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to purchase a multiple carrier wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity system, post implementation support and maintenance support.  MMAC is a campus environment and is comprised of over fifty buildings plus tunnels connecting certain major buildings.  The wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity requirement will start with the fifteen most heavily occupied buildings (see spreadsheet), the Security Command center and the tunnel area.  Options for adding buildings should be included.  This requirement is to provide all personnel with cell phone connectivity within buildings, in basements and tunnel areas.  This requirement should also take into account the radar signals at MMAC and should in no way interfere with those signals.
Various organizations have purchased and installed Wilson amplifiers, duplexers, and antennas.  However, the current equipment covers only specific areas of those buildings where it is installed.  The purpose for this request for information is to have connectivity throughout all buildings including the tunnel area.
If the MMAC telephone switch were to incur loss of function, the cell phone in-building connectivity would allow for communication to continue.  Also, when all personnel are sent to the basements and tunnel areas during times of impending weather, this connectivity would assure continued communication and could be utilized, if required, as part of disaster recovery communication.  
Drawings are currently available for the top fifteen buildings, however due to security risks, these drawings will be available on an as needed basis and will require a non-disclosure agreement.  The drawings will be signed out to the requesting party and will be returned to the FAA after use.  The drawings are in electronic format and require AutoCad software for viewing.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517210; Wireless Telecommunications Carriers, with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.
Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the source list for this requirement and to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  
Interested vendors should respond with the following:1.	Documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is capable of fulfilling the requirement as evidenced by answering the questions that follow.  (The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor)a.	Can the vendor provide signal for wireless telecommunications (cell phones, pagers, Blackberry, etc) to building, including basement and tunnel areas.  If yes, please provide proof.b.	The FAA has a national wireless program and provides various carrier devices.  Can vendor's equipment provide non-carrier specific service?  c.	Explain how the vendor provides service in b.d.	What equipment is required?e.	Does the vendor install the equipment?f.	Does the vendor maintain equipment after installation?g.	Is there a instructional class that the FAA technicians can attend for certification to maintain the equipment?h.	Is the equipment currently installed in another government facility?  If so, include location and point of contact.i.	When is the vendor available to begin installation and how much time is required for completion?j.	The equipment would be located in our telecommunications' closets.  Is the equipment wall mounted, rack mounted, etc?k.	All buildings have shielding (older buildings have wire mesh, new buildings have metal faces).  Will vendor's equipment/signal work with shielded buildings?l.	Give an explanation of your company, equipment and services, not to exceed 20 pages.
2.	Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial response.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
 All responses should clearly be labeled WIRELESS.  Vendors must respond by 4:30 p.m. (CST), June 2, 2008.  Responses should be submitted electronically in either a portable document format (ie. *.pdf file) or Microsoft Word to: Diana.Pickel@faa.gov.  FAA will not respond telephonic inquiries.

<DESC>GSA's Office of General Supplies and Services (GSS), a business line of the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), has recently begun an organization-wide program to evaluate the procurement of Less-Then Truckload (LTL) and Truckload (TL) motor freight services. It is looking to reduce transportation costs while maintaining or improving quality and service.  GSS plans to do so through the implementation of a program that establishes stronger and closer relationships with one or more carriers.  It is GSS' goal to offer its outbound freight-all-kinds (FAK) shipments, moving via closed vans for LTL and TL shipments.  It is believed that both the carriers participating in this program and GSS will reap substantial benefits by determining methods of joint process improvement.
This solicitation is being released via the Internet through the FedBizOpps site at: www.fbo.gov.  In order to conduct this procurement most effectively, all notices and postings will be made at this location.  Please be aware that the solicitation, questions and answers, comments, or any other information will not be disseminated in any other format.  Be sure you check the web site regularly for any amendments.  We suggest that you also bookmark GSA's GSS web site as it contains information of interest associated with GSS programs:  www.gsa.gov/gss.  

GSA is currently soliciting for proposals to provide transportation services as outlined in the attached solicitation.  The services are for outbound LTL and TL shipments originating from GSS' two distribution centers and moving within the Continental United States (CONUS) at this time.  The Eastern Distribution Center (EDC) is located at 1900 River Road, Burlington, NJ 08016.  The Western Distribution Center (WDC) is located at 700 E Roth Road, Bldg 230, French Camp, CA 95231.  Based on 12 months of shipment data, spanning November 2006 through October 2007, GSS' total annual expenditures for outbound LTL and TL shipments moving within CONUS is approximately $13 million.  

The solicitation is an effort by the GSA to determine whether savings over current costs can be achieved through an independent contract vehicle with one or more quality suppliers.  GSA makes no guarantee that a contract award will be made and will not pay costs incurred by firms in responding to the solicitation.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for a program entitled Hollow Fiber Studies and Mathematical Modeling to Determine the Dosage and Frequency of Administration of Amoxicillin for Anthrax Prophylaxis for Pregnant Women and Children. The NAICS Code is 541712, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
	
A. Background:

In 2001, an intentional release of anthrax spores in New York City, Washington, D.C, and Florida through the U.S. postal system resulted in 22 confirmed cases of anthrax, 11 cases of inhalational anthrax and 5 fatalities. Over 10,000 people were prescribed a 60 day course of antibiotics for exposure prophylaxis.  The optimal dosage and frequency of administration of antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment of inhalational anthrax is unknown, although available animal studies and human case reports suggest that the current recommendations for ciprofloxacin and doxycycline may be adequate for the general population.  

However, women who are pregnant are a special subgroup in whom treatment with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are to be avoided unless no other antibiotic options are available (ie: the benefit of these drugs outweighs the risks to mother and fetus), and alternative therapies are needed for children.  Amoxicillin has been used successfully for treatment and prophylaxis against B. anthracis in animal studies and in human case studies, where the pathogen is known to be susceptible to this drug.  Amoxicillin is a category A drug, deemed safe for mother and fetus.  However, the optimal dose and dosing frequency for amoxicillin to treat anthrax is unknown.  Furthermore, since the distribution and elimination of drugs often differ in pregnant and non-pregnant women, it is unknown whether an amoxicillin regimen that is shown to be efficacious in non-pregnant persons will maintain its efficacy in women who are pregnant.  In addition, modeling is needed to determine the optimal Amoxicillin dosing strategy for children based on pharmacokinetic data.


B. Objectives:

The specific programmatic goals of this requirement are to use the hollow fiber model of B. anthracis infection (using the &#916;Sterne strain):

1.	To conduct dose-fractionation studies in the hollow fiber system to determine the pharmacodynamic parameter linked with the efficacy of amoxicillin for the treatment of B. anthracis infection. 
2.	To conduct dose-ranging studies in the hollow fiber infection model to determine the intensity of exposure associated with optimal amoxicillin efficacy.
3.	To determine the pharmacodynamically-optimized amoxicillin dosage and frequency of dosing that prevents emergence of resistance during therapy.
4.	Using the data derived from these hollow fiber studies together with human PK data, apply mathematical modeling (population PK analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and Target Attainment analysis) to develop amoxicillin regimens that should provide optimal benefit to pregnant and non-pregnant women and pediatric populations for prophylaxis against anthrax.

C.  Scope of Work :

Independently, and not as an agent of the U.S. Federal Government, the offeror shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to conduct studies to determine the dosage and frequency of administration of amoxicillin for anthrax prophylaxis for pregnant women and children.  

The offeror will perform hollow fiber dose-fractionation studies and establish peak concentrations, time above the MIC and AUC for q12h, q6h and q3h dosing given for 14 days.  Hollow fiber dose-ranging studies will be performed.  Amoxicillin assays and susceptibility testing with mutation frequency studies will be obtained.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research for a project entitled Development of Quality by Design (QbD) Guidance Elements on Design Space Specifications Across Scales with Stability Considerations. The NAICS Code is 541712, with a small business size standard 500 employees.
A. Project Background

A goal of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is to implement the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidances Q8, Q9, and Q10 covering drug product development (through Quality by Design), risk management, and quality management systems. The ICH guidances are aligned with CDER's Critical Path initiative, Moving Manufacturing into the 21st Century, to develop new manufacturing approaches that improve sponsors' ability to assess and improve product quality.

Quality by Design (QbD), a component of the ICH Q8 guidance, offers the possibility of improving product quality. Realization of the QbD paradigm requires a systematic framework for determining the design space for specific operations and their processes as a whole. Such a framework will facilitate process innovation and continuous quality improvement, and reduce manufacturing costs. Further the risks of ending up with an undesired and unstable product due to process scale-up have not been addressed systematically.  The framework of this study will serve as a basis for formulating best practices and developing science based guidance documents that can be used by industry and potentially FDA to evaluate new and generic drug applications.


B. Statement of Work
To achieve the objectives above, it is necessary for the contractor to evaluate development and manufacturing operations for a small molecule (as opposed to more complex biotech molecules) to:

	Implement and/or refine existing models of critical unit operations (mixing and  granulation in a high shear mixer, and drying in a fluid bed dryer) to create design spaces and develop process-control-based models to predict and facilitate scale-up of pharmaceutical processes directly from the laboratory or pilot plant to the  large commercial scales.
	Develop a rigorous methodology with the case study of a small molecule that can be used to generate a preliminary design compatible with the time frame of the development process, and refine the design during and after the commercial scale development.
	Understand the factors affecting stability, and evaluate the risk of developing an unstable product because of scale dependent degradation
	Develop a peer-reviewed knowledge base to predict real time stability across scales, and transmit the knowledge through development of Knowledge-Based Decision Support Systems.
	Develop rationale for expiry dating in a quality by design paradigm.


In addition, the contractor must possess:

Employee Development and Staffing

The contractor shall provide a stable, competent work force to perform each task order. The contractor shall promote among its personnel the importance of gaining insight and appreciation about the organizational structures of CDER/OPS and its mission, policies, and organizational preferences. The contractor shall institute procedures to refresh and enhance this knowledge and understanding. Employees shall remain technically current in their fields of expertise.

Key Personnel

Continuity is critical to successful contract execution. The contractor shall not divert key personnel without the prior written consent of the Project Officer. In the event substitution becomes necessary (e.g., an employees departure from the company or medical disability), the OPS may require that the contractor provide replacement personnel. The contractor must demonstrate that the prospective substitute personnel possess qualifications commensurate with those of the personnel being replaced. The OPS reserves the right to disapprove the proposed substitutes.  

Specialized Expertise

In the performance of this SOW, the contractor may require access to highly specialized management or training skills or industry knowledge that the contractor may not have among its available employee base. Under these circumstances, the contractor may acquire these temporary short-term resources through other means. This contract requires that the contractor have quick and expedient access to these types of specialized business management consulting capabilities.

Necessary Qualifications of Personnel

To successfully fulfill the objectives of this contract, OPS has determined that the following skills or knowledge are essential:

	Knowledge of pharmaceutical manufacturing, engineering, and material science
	Knowledge of FDA Plain Language guidelines
	Demonstrable scientific knowledge by peer-reviewed publications in product/process understanding, Quality by Design by utilizing Process Analytical Technology Control Strategies, and stability research

Federal and Agency Standards and Policy

The contractor shall abide by all FDA and federal regulations, policies, and procedures in effect during the contract period of performance. This includes all changes in laws, regulations, policies, and procedures as they evolve during the contract period of performance.
C. Project Background

A goal of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is to implement the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidances Q8, Q9, and Q10 covering drug product development (through Quality by Design), risk management, and quality management systems.

The framework of this study will serve as a basis for formulating best practices and developing science based guidance documents that can be used by industry and potentially FDA to evaluate new and generic drug applications.

D. Contract Place of Performance

The majority of work under this contract is expected to be conducted at the contractor's site. The laboratory scale work and method validations work will also be conducted collaboratively at FDA laboratories in Silver Spring, Maryland.  

E. Additional Information 

It is anticipated that a two year contract will be awarded.  FDA intends to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around May 26, 2008 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Gatan, Inc. of Warrendale, Pennsylvania for the purchase of a Cold Stage Milling Field Upgrade under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Metallurgy Department of NISTs Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory requires a Cold Stage Milling Field Upgrade for its existing Gatan Precision Ion Polishing System.  The serial number for NISTs existing Gatan Precision Ion Polishing System is P2101103.

Sole source determination is based on NISTs need for a Cold Stage Milling Field Upgrade to provide liquid nitrogen cooling to the PIPS sample holder that is guaranteed to be compatible with NISTs existing Gatan Precision Ion Polishing System.  Additionally, only the Gatan Cold Stage Milling Field Upgrade is guaranteed to allow the Precision Ion Polishing System to operate at its original performance specifications with no degradation of  performance specifications.  Since the Gatan Cold Stage Milling Field Upgrade kit components are of a design that is proprietary and unique to Gatan, and meet all of NISTs specifications and requirements, we require this order to be sole sourced to Gatan.  
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on May 23, 2008.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory (Metallurgy Division), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Newport Corporation, of Irvine, CA for a GTS70 linear stage with 70 mm of travel, and a ESP300-11N111 2-axis controller.

This is a follow-on procurement as defined in FAR Part 6.302-1(ii)(A). No other manufacturer has a commercially available system that would be 100 percent compatible with NISTs existing equipment.

Sole Source determination is based on the need to maintain 100 percent plug-in compatible and interchangeable (in terms of both hardware and software) with the existing NIST software for the high-throughput Raman/FTIR scanning systems.  The translations stages are used in combination with the controller and software to scan the high pressure chamber with respect to a laser source and detector.  The stages need to be able to move a heavy chamber (almost 20 lbs.) over a large scanning area ~30 mm with a micron level precision.  The 2-axis controller will allow the measurement of 2-D array combinatorial samples. Newport Corporation is sole manufacturer and distributor of this equipment.
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 30 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding: assessment of radiation doses resulting from exposures to radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons tests with Harold L. Beck, 33 Greenwich Ave., New York, NY 10014.</p>
<p>The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be one year from date of award with two one year option periods.</p>
<p>The purpose and objective of this procurement is to obtain the input and expertise of the contractor in the development, conduct, and review of studies related to the estimation of doses from radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons tests. These include, but are not limited to: 1) the improvement of the estimation of doses received by the populations of the Republic of Marshall Islands as the result of tests conducted at Bikini and Enewetak; 2) the re-analysis of individual thyroid doses received by the subjects of an epidemiologic study in Kazakhstan; 3) the preparation of an electronic fallout library; 4) the analysis of the electronic databases on fallout that were prepared at REB; and 5) the use of the fallout library and databases for detailed dose calculations.</p>
<p>Mr. Beck is the only known investigator in the world who is able to carry out the proposed work because of his vast knowledge of nuclear weapon testing since the 1950s, his expertise in radiation dose assessment, his familiarity with the work that was done on radioactive fallout and dose assessment in environmental measurement laboratories and in federal agencies, and his access to unpublished data of interest. Mr. Beck played a major role in all important U.S. dose reconstruction projects related to fallout from nuclear weapons tests. Mr. Beck is collaborating with NCI on all of its fallout projects. Finding any other individual with equal knowledge and experience would be extremely difficult; moreover, it would be detrimental to NCI studies to try and find another contractor.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on May 22, 2008.  For further information please contact Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

This contract action is for services for which NAVFAC FAR EAST, Facilities Engineering and Acquisition Division (FEAD) Yokosuka intends to solicit  and negotiate with only Toshiba Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, since the frequency converter is not a stand-alone equipment when considering the whole base electrical system.  The frequency converter is electronically connected to the centralized computer system called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).  The SCADA system picks up various electrical data from the entire base electrical systems including frequency converters to properly monitor and control the entire system.  Therefore, the frequency converters must be overhauled, maintained and repaired in a way that compatible to the SCADA.  Using a different companys converter would lead the Government to change the whole other existing supportive equipment.  The converter manufacture by the other companies is not adaptable to an existing SCADA system that has to work synchronously with the converter.  The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all correspondence received no later than 6 June 2008.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL) in Montgomery, Alabama intends to award a purchase order to General Atomics-ElectronicSystems, Inc. (GA-ESI) of San Diego, California using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1). The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain specific proprietary repair and replacement parts modified for use in EPA's national radiation network (RadNet). One component of RadNet features a national network of air monitoring stations that regularly collect air samples for analysis of radioactivity. RadNet has stations in each state and has been used to track environmental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons tests and nuclear accidents. Future uses of this network may include monitoring waste disposal and radioactive cleanup sites. RadNet also documents the status and trends of environmental radioactivity; these data are published by NAREL in a quarterly report entitled Environmental Radiation Data. GA-ESI was chosen for the initial procurement after a competitive process, and is uniquely qualified to satisfy this follow-on requirement for replacement parts as it is the only source able to modify the proprietary components to integrate into the current network of stations. As such, NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying EPA's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Reponses must be submitted in writing to Mr. Jami J. Rodgers, Contracting Officer, at rodgers.jami@epa.gov. A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1.

<DESC>Malaria is the single most important cause of morbidity and mortality in Tanzania in both adults and children under five years of age.  A full 93 percent of the population is considered at risk and approximately ninety five percent of cases are caused by the most virulent of the plasmodiumsPlasmodium falciparum.  In year 2000, 39 percent of all consultations in children under five were associated with malaria.  Overall, 100,000 -125,000 deaths occur per year in Tanzania, of which 65  80 percent is in children under five years of age.  The burden on the population and health services is high. 

The United States Presidents Malaria Initiative (PMI) is providing substantial resources to the Government of Tanzania through its ministries of health in mainland Tanzania and the Zanzibar islands.  PMI seeks to dramatically reduce malaria as a major killer of children in sub-Saharan Africa.  The goal is to reduce malaria deaths by 50 percent in targeted countries in Africa.  The initiative estimates that 85 percent coverage of vulnerable or high risk groups with preventive and curative actions will be necessary to achieve the goal.  The main actions the initiative will support are: promotion of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), prompt and effective case management of malaria and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in pregnancy.  Other interventions may be added as they become proven and available.

Tanzania has the largest PMI portfolio in the world.   PMIs FY 2006 and FY 2007 support to Tanzania was USD $11.5 million and $31 million respectively.  The third year total has been approved for $34 million. It currently consists of 24 management units. The United Republic of Tanzania consists of Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar, each with its own Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOH), and distinct malaria control program, so the Tanzania PMI essentially supports two country programs. PMI in Tanzania continues to scale up programs in support of the NMCP and ZMCP.  The major challenges and future directions for PMI in 2008 can be found at the PMI website: www.pmi.gov.

The Tanzania PMI team is led by the USAID/Tanzania Mission Director and consists of the Team Leader of the USAID Health and Population Office (HPO), a USAID Technical Advisor and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Technical Advisor, and a Program Management Specialist.  Two other HPO officers support the PMI program.

The current USAID Technical Advisor will be leaving Tanzania in July 2008.  

Position Duties and Responsibilities:
The PMI USAID Technical Advisor, in collaboration with the PMI CDC Technical Advisor and Programme Management Specialist, shall provide leadership, guidance and overall direction on the development and execution of the PMI in Tanzania. The PMI USAID Technical Advisor, in collaboration with the PMI CDC Technical Advisor, shall provide managerial and technical support to Tanzanias National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and Zanzibar Malaria Control Program (ZMCP) Program Managers and staff and help to build capacity within the NMCP and ZMCP.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to acquire on a sole source basis with Primate Products in Redwood, CA for 20 Chinese Rhesus between the ages of 2.5 to 7 years old.

These non-human primates (NHPs) are for the second phase of an ongoing experiment.  During the first phase of this study 24 NHPs were obtained from Primate Products.  Genetic uniformity is critical to compare the 1st and 2nd phase results.  Generation traits of each breeding stock differ between breeders of similar NHPs and could potentially produce different results that will make comparisons with existing data impossible.  Because of this, the primates must come from the same breeder as that used in previous experiments to ensure consistency.

This award is IAW FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquires may be addressed to Nadine Utz, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Room A1040C, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 by 15 May 2008 at 12:00 p.m.

Step-Ladder Evaluation:  The following sample demonstrates the step-ladder evaluation method:
The price for each CLIN step-ladder quantity (e.g. $2,500) shall be multiplied by the maximum quantity in that respective range (e.g. 20), and by the weighted percentage of the total amount (e.g. $50,000.00/$590,000.00 = 8.4%) to determine the incremental weighted unit price (e.g. $210.00).  The incremental weighted unit prices (e.g. $210.00 + $358.80 + $449.40 + $490.20 +$489.60) shall then be summed to yield a final mid-point weighted average price (e.g. $1,998.00).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to identify the availability of potential sources capable to provide commercialization assistance for the National Science Foundations Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs Phase II and IIB grantees. 

This notice is for market research purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Quote or Request for Proposal; and, it is not considered to be a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided.  At this time no solicitation exists; therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the Federal Government, makes grant awards to small business concerns for research and development projects under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs.  The Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) is responsible for administering NSFs SBIR and STTR programs.  For information on the SBIR/STTR programs see http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir.  NSF is conducting market research to identify potential sources capable of delivering a program to enhance the effectiveness of the Phase II commercialization effort.  Based upon preliminary research, we believe potential offerors can provide NSF a broad distributed network of resources that includes partnerships with local and regional entities to effectively deliver a Phase II Commercialization Assistance Program (CAP).

The Phase II CAP requirement has three components: development and management of a mentor network that will provide regular (quarterly) guidance to NSF Phase II and IIB grantees; providing grantees enhanced capability to manage the grantees Intellectual Property (IP) portfolio; and a means to identify and access regional or local to the grantee- resources. 

All interested potential offerors should submit a package outlining their capabilities as relevant to the performance of these requirements.  The package should not exceed 4 pages and should contain the following information:  (1) A discussion of a proposed Phase II CAP work flow that demonstrates knowledge of the current NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II program; (2) A description of how the potential offeror would administer a geographically-distributed network mentor program to enhance the Phase II commercialization effort of NSF grantees; (3) A description of a process or tool the potential offeror would use to enable grantees to monitor and manage their Intellectual Property portfolio; (4) A description of an IT management tool to identify grantee-local resources which can be utilized by NSF and NSFs grantees; and (5) Provide a brief synopsis of specific commercialization experience in a technology-enabled business. 


Responses must be received by 3PM (EST) on May 20, 2008.  Please provide these packages via email to Ms. Evelyn S. Tyndell at etyndell@nsf.gov.  Please include the following documentation: Name of Company and Address; Point of Contact and Phone Number; and business size (small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled small business, HUBZone, 8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman owned, or large business), if you have a GSA Schedule contract please identify the contract number(s).

<DESC>The California Institute of Technologys (Caltech) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA), is seeking the interest of potential sources for IT server consolidation andvirtualization services.BACKGROUND: JPL has an inventory of about 19,000 computers, ranging from Windows andMacintosh desktops, to 1,000 node compute clusters. Of these 19,000 computers, about5,600 are computer servers performing a wide variety of computing tasks.  The spacerequirements of this diverse server population are exceeding JPLs capacity, and plans toadd many new computing capabilities over the next few years means that the Lab needs toconsolidate its computing footprint both through hardware consolidation, as well as theuse of virtualization tools.REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This Request For Information (RFI) proposes to obtain releasableinformation from major providers of IT consolidation and virtualization servicesregarding their direct experience with providing successful server consolidation andvirtualization assessments, consulting and services to private companies and/orgovernment agencies similar and size and complexity to JPL. The consolidated informationreceived will be considered in determining JPLs approach to IT consolidation andvirtualization, including whether JPL could realize advantages in cost or service byprocuring these services instead of self-providing.The Laboratory respectfully requests a direct but concise response to each of thefollowing key tasks and how your company is fully qualified to successfully execute them,keeping in mind the eventual purpose is to review the Labs computing environment toassess the potential for virtualization, and to make suggestions on the most effectivepath to achieving that potential.TASK 1 - Review the computing environment. JPL has an inventory of about 19,000computers, ranging from individual laptops to large compute clusters. There are a numberof data sources that describe this inventory, among them the Property Data Base, and theIT Security Data Base. This task is to review each of the data sources to quickly cullthose machines that are: (a) servers; and (b) are likely to be of an age and type thatwill make them suitable for consolidation or virtualization.  In addition, there will bea physical component to the consolidation, and during this review, estimates must be madeof the physical dimensions and rackability of the identified equipment.This task must be performed in conjunction with the staff responsible for these machines. Attention must be paid to the applications being run, the expected lifetime of thesoftware (and the mission) supported by the application.TASK 2 - Select scenarios. Based on the results of Task 1, define a series ofrepresentative scenarios that will bin the Labs computers into similar types foranalysis purposes. For example, there are workstation class computers that run flightsoftware, while other machines run COTS database software such as MySQL or Oracle.  Thereare large supercomputers, and hundreds of departmental application systems running bothCOTS and custom software. Since the time and cost to investigate each machine separatelyis prohibitive, sample scenarios will be used to explore the level of virtualization thatis achievable. If analysis software is to be used during the Investigation, the issues ofdeploying this software will be addressed at this stage, along with the permission of theowners of these systems to run the analysis software.TASK 3 - Investigate scenarios for their virtualization potential. Through interviews,the use of analysis tools, or other techniques, the scenarios outlined in Task 2, will beinvestigated and consolidation and virtualization opportunities identified.  For example,analysis software may be appropriate for investigating COTS applications, butconfiguration controlled flight systems will probably need to be examined throughinterviews with system administrators. Expectations on the amount of consolidation andvirtualization that can be achieved will be set during this task, as well as the barrierspreventing the use of consolidation and virtualization techniques.TASK 4 - Consolidate results of scenario analysis in Task 3. When Task 3 is complete, thescenario analyses will be consolidated to provide an estimate of the overallconsolidation and virtualization potential across the Lab.  This estimate will includeestimates of the required physical resources (rack space, investment in new machines andsoftware) as well as the software investments required, and in the labor required.TASK 5 - Recommend implementation approaches for JPL. Based on the consultantsexperience with other organizations, recommend approaches for JPL to achieve itsvirtualization potential. These approaches may include organization changes, investmentsin equipment and software, and investments in continuing specialized expertise during theconversion process.TASK 6 - Conduct a pilot virtualization exercise with JPL staff. With the help of JPLstaff, select a candidate suite of applications and virtualize them onto a single server.The purpose of this task is to identify technical and programmatic barriers tovirtualization at JPL, and to educate JPL management and staff on virtualization bestpractices.  RESPONSE DEADLINE: Please submit your response in accordance with the above informationto JPL no later than June 5, 2008.POINTS OF CONTACT: Please direct any questions to Dennis Horgan, Email:dennis.n.horgan@jpl.nasa.gov; Phone: 818-393-0667 or Douglas Hughes, Email:douglas.s.hughes@jpl.nasa.gov; Phone 818-354-1186.DISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planningpurposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL willsolicit you for such procurement in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will beresponsible for any costs incurred by you in furnishing this information. Prospectivecontractors are advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnishedwith unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, orreproduction of such data.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is in search of a small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, women owned business, service-disabled veteran owned and/or 8(a) small business concerns who can provide telephone systems, maintenance services and technical support services to existing telephone systems located in the various field offices within the continental U.S and its territories.
 
There are approximately 2,000 offices at over 1500 specific locations in various SSA Field Offices (FO), Area Director Offices (ADO) and Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) field offices throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, and American Samoa that currently have various telephone systems models. The interested vendors will be required to be knowledgeable and able to support the various telephone system models and approximate quantities of 778-Fujitsu F9600s, 451-Executone IDS 108s, IDS 228s, and Medleys, 248-ESI-IVXs and ESI IVX 128s, 5-Iwatsu, 4-Intertel AXXESSs, 3-NEC 704is, 2-Omegas, 1-Comdial, and 1-Cisco ICS 7750 telephone systems at these locations.  Some locations may have multiple telephone systems and in-phone and/or overhead paging systems that are connected to the existing systems.  The requested maintenance services that SSA is seeking will be for (1) base year and four (4) option years.
 
The maintenance and on-going support services will include, but not be limited to repair, labor, 
materials, and replacement parts necessary to keep these telephone systems and related
equipment in satisfactory working condition.  These ongoing services will include internal moves, adds and changes; remote programming, relocations, programming for spring and fall time changes, and various maintenance records and status reports. 

The annual maintenance shall also include the installations of Remote Service Observation equipment and Caller Recontact/Caller ID boxes used in the telephone access studies at 110 selected offices.  This yearly project entails de-installation of SSA owned RSO and Caller ID equipment, re-installation into a new set of Pilot offices, and maintenance of the project equipment. 

Services maintained through the systems shall include cable distribution from the point of 
demarcation established by the servicing local regulated telephone company to all demarcation
wire and cable, distribution frames, backboards and mounting materials.  The telephone systems will include all station equipment, automated attendant/voice mail systems, administrative terminals, automatic call distributors, telemonitors, caller ID boxes, telephone line protection, voltage protection devices (if applicable), paging systems and power supplies. 


Basic Requirements

All maintenance and support for telephone systems expansion (e.g., installation of line card, new station, etc) shall be accomplished without interruption to existing service during normal business hours (8:00 a.m.  5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday ).  However, the Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM) will be 8:00 am  5 pm within each perspective time zone. Reporting of maintenance related problems shall be via a contractors toll free number, which is available 24 hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  

Maintenance shall include travel, mileage, parts, materials and labor. The contractor is required to attend monthly technical meetings at the SSAs Headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland to discuss on-going matters of importance and concerns relative to the telephone maintenance contract, if requested, and to participate from the contractors remote site in any telephone conference call with SSA staff and SSA Regional staff to discuss matters of mutual importance regarding the telephone maintenance contract.  

SSA is attaching a draft Statement of Work.  The interested vendor will be required to provide maintenance and on-going support services for existing telephone system expansions, relocations, move-add-change request, perennial time changes, various system reports and on-site or remote reprogramming changes to the systems on an as needed basis.

Additionally, the interested vendor shall be required to provide availability and access for the purchase and installation of approximately 100 telephone systems to the SSA during the life of the contract.  The SSA will guarantee installation of 45 of these new systems in the first contract year, of which the new systems are expected to be installed immediately.  SSA plans to purchase an additional 55 telephone systems over the life of the contract. These telephone systems will be basic telephone systems with no enhanced features (see attached draft maintenance contract with telephone system replacement section).  After the warranty period, the telephone systems will be added to the maintenance contract and maintained by the vendor.  

At the request of the SSA, the replacement systems provided by the vendor will:
-	Be capable of growth
-	May require station moves
-	May be de-installed and removed 
-	Have services related to the installation of modular/systems furniture, 
-	May require changes to the up-front and queue greetings, 
-	May require general telephone system reprogramming,
-	May require reprogramming of maintenance modems. 

SSA is initiating the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TSRP) to replace all of the SSA owned telephone systems over the next 4-5 years.  The number of telephone systems maintained will decrease with the implementation and installation of TSRP. The new TSRP will be installing new Telephone systems, replacing the aging legacy systems.  As these systems are replaced, they will be removed from this maintenance contract, causing a gradual decrease in the quantity of systems being maintained during this 4-5 year period.  The TSRP vendor will be responsible for the removal and disposal of the de-installed legacy telephone systems.  The government will notify the vendor of the specific offices as installation dates are scheduled, with at least 30 days prior notice.  These offices will be removed from the maintenance contract, via an email from the COTR on a monthly basis throughout the replacement.  When systems are replaced by a vendor, SSA may instruct the vendor to recover the old telephone system parts to assist in maintaining the current telephone systems.

Vendors responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should be made aware that this is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by SSA to form a binding contract.  SSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI.  SSA will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions or follow up information that is requested.

SSA is requesting the following information in the vendors response:

1) All  applicable North American Industry Classification Code(s) and Small Business Status 
2) Vendor capabilities to provide parts and technical expertise to support the aging systems or alternative process to maintain systems
3) Proposed business processes to perform maintenance in these offices located throughout the Continental U.S., Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa
4) Trouble Reporting processes and capabilities
5) Responses for partial capabilities, if submitting vendor cannot support all three manufacturer types.  

Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential procurement. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of capabilities in writing to Michele Tubman, Contracting Officer, via email at Michele.tubman@ssa.gov.  Please reference SSA-RFI-MT002 in the email subject line. Response must be received by 10:00 am EST May 22, 2008.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The University of Memphis, 115 Wilder Tower, Memphis TN  38152-0001 for the use of facilities, and adjoining support services at the University of Memphis, Center for Earthquake Research and Information, which includes:  Office Space and Utilities, use of secretarial, drafting and computer staff, graduate research assistant, network access and usage for computer equipment, miscellaneous copying charges, mail etc., dedicated fax line and monthly charges, and GIS services - Tech info specialist.The U.S. Geological Survey has an ongoing requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI).  The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States.  The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice.This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) requires that the US Geological Survey (USGS), Department of the Interior, to emphasize earthquake hazards research and related activities in four geographic regions, one of which is the central US/New Madrid region.  The USGS NEHRP in the New Madrid region benefits from the scientific and technical investigations carried out by the University of Memphis by experts with special skills and experience in earthquake research and mitigation activities.  The presence of University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (UM/CERI) with its longstanding active research programs in the New Madrid region, makes it necessary for the USGS to work cooperatively in order to strengthen the regional research effort to reduce earthquake hazards in this seismically active part of the United States.It is imperative that the USGS scientists are located on-site at the University in order to perform collaborative research, conduct cooperative seismological studies, interpret seismic data records and documentation archived at the University, and attend meetings and conferences held on campus often with no prior notice.Another location off-campus would inhibit scientific interaction with the UM scientists, reduce the effectiveness of important cooperative research activities with the University, and make more inaccessible the scientific and technical database required for USGS seismic research.Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 611310 which is $6.5 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Quotation<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region [Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1], a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia.  Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Non-Slip Hard-Soled Patient Slippers.     <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR> The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (Westpoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years total).  Anticipated selection date is June 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for the Non-Slip Hard-Soled Patient Slippers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Non-Slip Hard-Soled Patient Slippers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.  Point of Contact (Tracy.Martin-Tilghman@amedd.army.mil)   (202-782-3663).    <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Non-Slip Hard-Soled Patient Slippers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $10,202.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown below:<BR><BR>MfgPn		Description							    % of Total<BR>80208		Slippers, Adult, Size 9-10					      44.3%<BR>80205		Slippers, Adult, Beige, Size 6-7				      32.1%<BR>80209		Slippers, Adult, Size 11-12					      21.7%<BR><BR>At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors may be required to provide on-site support during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.

Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on Thursday, May 29, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include the above vendor requirement to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria/product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region that its initial submission, and subsequent price quotes and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/ quotes without discussions.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor initial responses should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by submitting their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria and required electronic product literature as required to the above Northeast Region POC by the required due date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed by the Northeast Region POC.  .  <BR><BR>  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative.      <BR>1.  Vendor must provide a complete line of Non-Skid Hard-Soled Patient Slipper products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.   <BR>      a.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes Non-Skid Hard-Soled Patient <BR>Slippers appropriate for children age 2 and older, and adult sizes small, medium, <BR>large, and extra-large.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied<BR>(catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>      b.  Individual products packaging must be clearly labeled as to size or size range.<BR>2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Non-Skid Hard-Soled Patient Slipper product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.<BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the Northeast Region prime vendor is Owens-Minor) for distribution within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.  Provide documentation of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for the Northeast Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address in response to this RFQ.<BR>6.  Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Non-Skid Hard-Soled Patient Slipper products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant, i.e. positive resolutions, etc., in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.  Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all Non-Skid Hard-Soled Patient Slippers to be supplied.  Provide this electronic information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFRIAQ.  Provide information explaining whether or not the instructions/directions are supplied with the individual item packaging, or are provided with the larger units of packaging only, i.e. per case, etc.<BR>8.  Vendors must provide inservice/implementation support as needed and identify company resources for such requirements in response to this RFRIAQ.  Provide literature, if available, on this implementation support.<BR>9.  Vendor must provide Customer Service during routine business hours (Monday-Friday 9:00AM-5:00PM) and identify company resources for such support in response to this RFRIAQ.   <BR>10.  Vendors must provide a list of vendor production and product safety standards under which all itemized brand(s) and styles are manufactured and/or distributed for Non-Skid Hard-Soled Patient Slipper products.  In response to this RFRIAQ, vendors must provide a list of these standards and the vendors mechanism to assure that all quoted products meet these standards.  <BR>11.  Vendors must provide products that are latex-free and hypoallergenic (including dyes used in manufacturing).  Vendors must ensure that all individual products are clearly labeled as latex-free and hypoallergenic (including dyes used in manufacturing).  Vendors must provide samples and descriptions of the labeling in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the designated TRBO Clinical Analyst.  Requested product sample sets must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the <BR>14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting product sample sets.  Sample sets must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the sample sets required by COB 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Extremely Poor; Two (2)Below Average; Three (3)Average; Four (4)Above Average; and Five (5)Excellent.   All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.  The CPT will determine the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near the 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score target thresholddepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Scores (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75 Total Averaged Score Clinically Acceptability target threshold in determining the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold.  Vendors whose Total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with a Clinically Acceptability Target Threshold3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.        <BR>1.   Slipper material holds to the foot/ankle without drooping/sagging and without impairing circulation<BR>        a.    Slipper material that droops/sags with movement or walking may result in a<BR>        patient fall risk, and slipper material that holds to the foot/ankle too tightly may<BR>        impair circulation to the tissue leading to discomfort or further injury to tissue.<BR>b.	 Evaluator dons pair of slippers of the appropriate size/size range, moves<BR> foot/ankle through a full range of motion, and walks on both carpeted and non-<BR> carpeted (tile or wood) walking surfaces with a non-shuffling gait and with a   <BR> shuffling gate for a distance of at least 100 feet.<BR>c.	 Evaluator observes for any drooping/sagging of slipper material and observes <BR>for any changes in skin color/temperature of foot/ankle tissue and any pressure<BR>marks on skin of ankle/foot made by the slipper material in a non-clinical <BR>setting.<BR>2.   Slipper non-skid material on the tread surface maintains integrity and grips the walking surface without slipping or sliding.<BR>       a.   Non-skid material on tread surface must be of sufficient amount and positioning to assure tread grips the walking surface with each step without slipping or sliding which may increase fall risk.<BR>b.   Evaluator dons pair of slippers of the appropriate size/size range and walks on both carpeted and non-carpeted (tile or wood) walking surfaces with a non-shuffling gait and with a shuffling gate for a distance of at least 100 feet.<BR>c.    Evaluator observes for the griping quality and effectiveness of the non-skid tread material, and observes for any cracking, peeling, or chipping of non-skid tread material leading to compromise of griping quality and effectiveness in a non-clinical setting.  <BR>3.  Slipper interior seams/surfaces are smooth and do not cause pressure or irritation to tissues of the foot/ankle.<BR>      a.    Rough interior seams/surfaces can cause pressure, impair circulation, and/or can cause discomfort which may inhibit or deter patient walking.<BR>      b.    Evaluator dons pair of slippers of the appropriate size/size range, moves foot/ankle through a full range of motion, and walks on both carpeted and non-carpeted (tile or wood) walking surfaces with a non-shuffling gait and with a shuffling gate for a distance of at least 100 feet.<BR>      c.    Evaluator observes for any pressure, rough surfaces, or discomfort during walking caused by seams/surfaces inside the slipper in a non-clinical setting.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis.  <BR>(1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region. This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  <BR>(2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.<BR>(3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum Clinically Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Scoredepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Scores (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores) as determined by the CPT will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose Total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors that fail to respond as required by 4:00PM EDT on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.      <BR>       Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.    <BR>END<BR><BR>     <BR><BR>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Quotation<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region [Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1], a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia.  Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Non-Skid Sock-Type Patient Slippers.     <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR> The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (Westpoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years total).  Anticipated selection date is June 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for the Non-Skid Sock-Type Patient Slippers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Non-Skid Sock-Type Patient Slippers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.  Point of Contact: <BR>tracy.martin-tilghman@amedd.army.mil  (202-782-3663).    <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Non-Skid Sock-Type Patient Slippers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $40,526.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown below:<BR><BR>MfgPn			Description						% of Total<BR>5090			CHAMP Slip-Not XL-Adult				      50.8%<BR>66602			MEDC Clipper Terry NoSkid LG Beige		      25.0%<BR>5070			CHAMP Slip-Not Adult				      11.2%<BR>80106			Slippers, Adult, XLG					        5.0%<BR>6601			MEDC Slipper Terry NoSkid MED Blue		        4.5%<BR><BR>At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors may be required to provide on-site support during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  larry.shaughnesy@amedd.army.mil (202-782-3666).  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on Thursday, May 29, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include the above vendor requirement to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria/product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region that its initial submission, and subsequent price quotes and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/ quotes without discussions.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor initial responses should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by submitting their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria and required electronic product literature as required to the above Northeast Region POC by the required due date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed by the Northeast Region POC.  .  <BR><BR>  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative.      <BR>1.

Slipper non-skid material on the tread surface maintains integrity and grips the walking surface without slipping or sliding.<BR>       a.   Non-skid material on tread surface must be of sufficient amount and positioning to assure tread grips the walking surface with each step without slipping or sliding which may increase fall risk.<BR>     b.   Evaluator dons pair of slippers of the appropriate size/size range and walks on both carpeted and non-carpeted (tile or wood) walking surfaces with a non-shuffling gait and with a shuffling gate for a distance of at least 100 feet.<BR>c.    Evaluator observes for the griping quality and effectiveness of the non-skid tread material, and observes for any cracking, peeling, or chipping of non-skid tread material leading to compromise of griping quality and effectiveness in a non-clinical setting.  <BR>3.  Slipper interior seams/surfaces are smooth and do not cause pressure or irritation to tissues of the foot/ankle.<BR>      a.    Rough interior seams/surfaces can cause pressure, impair circulation, and/or can cause discomfort which may inhibit or deter patient walking.<BR>      b.    Evaluator dons pair of slippers of the appropriate size/size range, moves foot/ankle through a full range of motion, and walks on both carpeted and non-carpeted (tile or wood) walking surfaces with a non-shuffling gait and with a shuffling gate for a distance of at least 100 feet.<BR>      c.    Evaluator observes for any pressure, rough surfaces, or discomfort during walking caused by seams/surfaces inside the slipper in a non-clinical setting.<BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis.  <BR>(1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region. This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  <BR>(2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.<BR>(3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum Clinically Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Scoredepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Scores (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores) as determined by the CPT will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose Total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  Price quotes must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors that fail to respond as required by COB 4:00PM EDT on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.      <BR>       Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.    <BR>END<BR>     <BR><BR>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Hawaii, Guam, Okinawa, Japan, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Custom Surgical Packs.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, and 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, Japan. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Custom Surgical Packs, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $828,817. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. <BR><BR>The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>Part #SMA55CSTAD, C SECTION PACK, Del Qty 335, annual usage $64,876.10<BR>Part #SBA55MNMDB, GENERAL MINOR/121, Del Qty 202, annual usage $33,865.30<BR>Part #SOP55OBOKB, ORTHO BASIC PACK, Del Qty 245, annual usage $31,262.00<BR>Part #SOP55LETAF, LOWER EXTREMITY PACK, Del Qty 127, annual usage $26,207.72<BR>Part #SOP55ARTAG, ARTHROSCOPY PACK, Del Qty 126, annual usage $25,716.60<BR>Part #SMA55CSOKC, C-SECTION PACK, Del Qty 110, annual usage $22,885.50<BR>Part #SBA55BGOKC, BASIC GENERAL TRAY, Del Qty 121, annual usage $21,626.33<BR>Part #SBA55MJTAE, GENERAL MAJOR PACK, Del Qty 122, annual usage $19,615.16<BR>Part #SNE55NBTAA, NEURO BACK PACK, Del Qty 142, annual usage $19,182.78<BR>Part #SOP55LETAE, LOWER EXTREMITY PACK, Del Qty 90, annual usage $17,442.90<BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Regional Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor. <BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors<BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 5:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge product samples and literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D. Source Selection Procedures  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. <BR><BR>The TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. Vendors that do not meet the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vendor. <BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team will request no charge literature and samples from the product line to be evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. The samples to be provided are as follows: One Custom Surgical Pack with the specific items as listed in Technical Criteria #1. Samples are to be sent to each participating MTF.<BR><BR>Vendors are required to ship their literature and no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 30 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time, on the 30 calendar days after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; Five (5) = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. To determine acceptability, a TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting. <BR><BR><BR>Vendors will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided 7 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 5:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 7th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric) and (4) consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. Due to the potential for base DAPA prices to be inflated, the impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria<BR>The following Technical/Company Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Operating Room (OR) Custom Surgical Packs. A complete line of products defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, the following items are required: Bag Mayo Refuse 11.5x13in Self-Adherent (1),Blade Surgical #15 Carbon Steel (x2), Bowl Sponge 32oz 1000cc Blue  Medegen/Medical Action* (x1), Cleaner Cautery Tip (Scratch Pad)  Valley Lab/Tyco Kendall  Covidien* (x1) 2 inch x 2 inch, Cover Back Table 65x90inch, heavy duty  Kimberly Clark* , Cover light handle semi rigid lite sleeve (x2), Cover mayo stand 23inch reinforced wide  Kimberly Clark* (x1), Drape Surgical Three Quarter 57x76 inch  Kimberly Clark* (x1), Gown  XLarge, fabric reinforced W/Towel  Kimberly Clark * (x1), Gown Large, fabric reinforced W/Towel  Kimberly Clark* (x1), Handle Suction Yankauer Non vented Bulbous Tip (x1), Label Blank Standard Size White  (x6), Marker Skin W/Ruler standard tip Violet 9 Labels.

(x1), Towel 17x27inch Cotton Fluff Blue Universal (x8), and Tubing Suction 6mm 12 foot Non Conductive Clear Banded, Cardinal (x1).*The items that have asterisks and show a specific vendors name are those items, which have been standardized and will be included in custom surgical packs.<BR><BR>2. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Custom Surgical Packs product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.<BR><BR>3. Vendor must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in the Pacific Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified. Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR><BR>4. Vendor must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.<BR><BR>5.  Vendor must provide no cost educational tools, product literature, and materials for Custom Surgical Packs as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources in your response.<BR><BR>6.  Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support in your response.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Vendors outside wrapping material of internal contents (Custom Surgical Pack) is durable and intact. (Maintain sterilization of contents, maintain integrity of materials, and eliminate the potential for degradation of materials) Addresses both patient safety and cost.<BR>	1. a. The outside wrapping is free of holes, punctures, splits in the heat sealed edges and 	tears anywhere.<BR>1. b. This criterion will be evaluated by 5 trials (Five MTFs performing the trials) in a non-clinical setting. Each trial will involve a team of 7 proficient surgical personnel.<BR>1. c. The evaluators will carefully scrutinize all three dimensions of the packaging for any punctures, tears, compromise to the heat-sealed edges. The expectation is that no such compromise to the protection of the contents will be found.<BR><BR>2. The internal components will be free of stains, punctures to components or tearing of any materials. (Evidence of tampering, crushing, moisture intrusion, and a break in the sterile wrapping would make the entire custom surgical pack unusable and is mandated to be destroyed) Addresses patient safety, cost effectiveness, and issues of contamination. An item is either sterile or unsterile. If evidence of crushing, breaking of sealant seams and moisture intrusion is discovered, with any item within the custom surgical pack, the entire custom surgical pack is unusable.<BR>	2. a. No item within the protective outer wrap is found to be damaged.<BR>	2. b. This criterion will be evaluated by 5 trials (Five MTFs performing the trials) 	in a non-clinical setting. Each trial will involve a team of 7 proficient surgical 	personnel. <BR>2. c. Upon breaking the seal of the outer shipping wrapper, each item is examined 	for any damage, any moisture intrusion, or any breakage of items. The expectation is that no breakage or damage is discovered with any item.<BR><BR>3. The contents of the custom surgical pack will be arranged in order of usage by the surgical staff. (It is critical to efficiency of time that the contents are layered in order of use. This is an accepted and consistent standard of surgical practice.) Addresses issues of patient safety  time under anesthesia and efficiencies with use of surgical suite resources.<BR>	3. a. The items are layered correctly and in accordance with step-by-step use by the 	surgical team.<BR>	3. b. This criterion will be evaluated by 5 trials (Five MTFs performing the trials) In a 	non-clinical setting. Each trial will involve a team of 7 proficient surgical personnel.<BR>3. c. Each layer will be identified as to its purpose and whether or not any layer is 	out of sequence. No sequential layering error is anticipated.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license or enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop the MicroCED:  Microbial Based Chlorinated Ethene Destruction process.  Scientists at Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed MicroCED, an innovative, reliable, and cost-effective treatment technology for the containment, detoxification, and elimination of chlorinated ethenes in the environment.  Chlorinated ethenes are toxic substances generated through industrial production, dry cleaning and metal degreasing operations.  Once they penetrate the water table these compounds often become distributed over large land areas, thereby increasing the risk for human exposure.  Any company interested in licensing this device or participating in a Funds-In CRADA must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the companys business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology. Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in Licensing this invention or participating in a Funds-In CRADA only.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Lozinak Baseball Properties LLC, Jackson, TN. The award will be made for the purchase of an advertising package with the Jackson Diamond Jaxx Baseball team in Jackson, TN This procurement is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, for Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Barry Baxter, PO Box 41502 Nashville TN 37204, or sent by email to barry.baxter@ng.army.mil. Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 1. This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an advertising package for the Jackson Diamond Jaxx 2008 Baseball Season purchased through Lozinak Baseball Properties Inc., requested by the Recruiting Division of the Tennessee Army National Guard. 2. Jackson, Tennessee the seventh (7TH) largest city in the state of Tennessee with a population of fifty nine thousand, six hundred and forty three (59,643); the marketing division for the Recruiting Division of the Tennessee Army National Guard needs an advertising media to target potential recruits in this population center. 3. The total estimated value of this advertising package is on file at this contracting office and can be obtained through Freedom of Information Act procedures. 4. Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5. The Jackson Diamond Jaxx AA Baseball Team Proposal is the only available advertisement to the demographic group needed for recruiting to the Tennessee Army National Guard in the Jackson Tennessee area, therefore making them the only source capable of fulfilling this requirement. 6. Efforts to solicit other contractors will be made via http://www.fedbizopps.gov in accordance with FAR 5.2. A Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source will be issued.  7. The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices previously proposed by the offeror. 8. Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 711211 for sports teams and clubs in Tennessee. Lozinak Baseball Properties LLC was th e only CCR registered vendor with the NAICS code for sports teams and clubs in this area. 9. There are no other facts to support the use of other than full and open competition. 10. No other firms expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11. No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the Jackson Diamond Jaxx baseball team is the sole baseball team in the Jackson, Tennessee area of its kind. 12. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. This notice is not a request for proposal. Responses to this notice will be considered for future requirements.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: UMCS II Contractors<BR><BR><BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, AL intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ID/IQ multiple year UMCS II contractors, Siemens Building Technologies, Williams Electric, TAC, Ameresco Select, Johnson Controls Building Automation Systems, EMC Engineers, Alabama Controls, and, for an increase to the ceiling on the current UMCS II Contracts DACA87-03-D-0028, DACA87-03-D-0029, DACA87-03-D-0030, DACA87-03-D-0031, DACA87-03-D-0032, W912DY-04-D-0013, W912DY-04-D-0014, W912DY-04-D-0015.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support the continuation of current efforts relating to the effective Utility Monitoring and Controls Systems to manage and install HVAC and Direct Digital Controls (DDC), fire alarm systems, and provide maintenance and services to the above systems.  These systems  consist of specialized software and networked displays to provide current and accurate controls and informational updates to operations for in-the-field use and links to command headquarters throughout the US Military base networks.  This action will be a modification to the existing firm fixed price contracts.  The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned through August 2009.  It is considered that award to a new contractor would result in a  significant duplication of cost well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition, and would result in unacceptable delays.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward all US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, AL UMCS II ID/IQ contractors.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Donna Ragucci at Donna.M.Ragucci@usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contracts DACA87-03-D-0028, DACA87-03-D-0029, DACA87-03-D-0030, DACA87-03-D-0031, DACA87-03-D-0032, W912DY-04-D-0013, W912DY-04-D-0014, W912DY-04-D-0015 is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.<BR>

(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. 
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 
(5) Terms of any express warranty; 
(6) Price and any discount terms; 
(7) Remit to address, if different than mailing address; 
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(l) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); 
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the senders request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking a contractor for Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP): Prediction of Treatment Response  REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.     

Requirements:  II. Project Title:  Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP): Prediction of Treatment Response
III. Background:
In March of 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a white paper entitled "Innovation or Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.   This report called for research to develop and validate new tools and methods for testing new medicines on the "critical path" from the laboratory to the patients. This initiative is called the Critical Path Initiative.

Under the auspices of this initiative, FDA in conjunction with academia launched an initiative in August 2006 called the Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP) focused on identifying scientific gaps in the design, implementation and interpretation of clinical trials of acute and chronic analgesic drug products, and on implementing projects that will bridge these gaps.  Under the ACTP, FDA and academia are working to coordinate and support a series of research projects, all focused on analgesic clinical trial design and product development. Through the ACTP, FDA and academia are identifying scientific gaps in the aforementioned areas, prioritizing projects based on public health needs and implementing them through the leveraging of resources and technical expertise from multiple partners.

In spite of the enormous advances in drug development over the past two or three decades, (e.g., drugs that cure cancer, biologic drug products that halt the progression of rheumatoid arthritis), the development of novel analgesic drug products has seriously lagged behind.  Indeed, to this day, the only analgesic drug products that are used widely and successfully are opioids, acetaminophen and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), all of which have serious, potentially life-threatening toxicities even when used properly. While there has been exploration at the earliest stages of drug development, there has been wide'-spread reluctance on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to take novel products further into development. This is in no small part due to the often daunting task of demonstrating the efficacy of analgesics in clinical trials. Many experts in analgesic drug development believe that it is the design of the clinical trials that is - at fault in this situation, and that better trial designs will yield more successful results. This hypothesis is certainly supported by the frequent failures of clinical efficacy trials of opioid drug products, considering the well established effectiveness of these products from literally thousands of years of clinical experience. The FDA wishes to engage a contractor to develop a model for prediction of the placebo response rates in analgesic clinical trials, and the relationship of response rates on study outcomes.  The FDA wishes to engage a contractor to determine the effect on study outcome of statistical imputation techniques on analgesic study outcomes.
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services necessary for performance of the work as described below.  All data and outcomes associated with this scope of work shall be provided to and go through the Project Officer (PO), to the FDA.   A final report shall be prepared by the contractor that summarizes the deliverables of this contract.  The contractor shall, in collaboration with FDA staff, identify analgesic trials and datasets for creation of a harmonized dataset, and establish a common data variable configuration and links to the appropriate data fields in each dataset.  This harmonized dataset shall be used to achieve the contract objectives, as stated above.  
Reporting Requirements and Deliverable Items:
The activities and deliverables under this Statement of Work must be completed during a one year period from the date of execution of the contract. Any extension (including No Cost Extensions) of this timeline must be done in writing and must be authorized by the PO.

1. Kick-off Meeting with FDA	Within 2 weeks
2. Project Workplan with identification of the appropriate clinical studies and databases	6 weeks
6. FDA briefings at key milestones, per the Workplan	6 weeks to 10 months
7.  Final meeting with FDA including draft report	10 months
8.  Final report	12 months

The contractor shall then further evaluate the data in the aforementioned harmonized dataset in an attempt to define potential novel methods of analyzing these data that will provide evidence of efficacy when it truly exists, and avoid false negative as well as false positive results. 

Potential novel analyses include, but are not limited to:
	Placebo response analysis  Factors determining placebo and treatment response rated in analgesic clinical trials
	Imputation strategy analysis  Determination of the effect on study outcome of alternative analysis techniques for handling missing data on the cumulative proportion of responder analysis (CPRA) and other more standard outcome analysis techniques

The contractor shall lead the development of appropriate publication/s and/or report/s, in collaboration with FDA staff on summaries and other finding from this Statement of Work, the number and content of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the contractor and the FDA Project Officer.

Criteria for Acceptance of Deliverables:
The contractor shall implement and maintain a quality assurance system to ensure the product integrity of all deliverables that meets or exceeds the requirements established in this SOW. Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other deliverables shall be performed at the place of delivery by the PO. [General quality measures, as set forth below, shall be applied to each work product received from the contractor under this statement of work.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking a contractor for Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP): Methods for Combined Analysis of Pain and Analgesic Rescue Scores
REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.     

Requirements: 
In March of 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a white paper entitled "Innovation or Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.   This report called for research to develop and validate new tools and methods for testing new medicines on the "critical path" from the laboratory to the patients. This initiative is called the Critical Path Initiative.

FDAs Critical Path Initiative (CPI) seeks to identify and address scientific and technical obstacles to the optimum development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  Under the CPI, FDA is trying to identify innovative ways to enhance drug development and reduce the time it takes to bring therapeutically important medical products to the market by leveraging prior knowledge.

Under the auspices of this initiative, FDA, in conjunction with academia launched an initiative in August 2006 called the Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP) focused on identifying scientific gaps in the design, implementation and interpretation of clinical trials of acute and chronic analgesic drug products, and on implementing projects that will bridge these gaps.  Under the ACTP, FDA and academia have initiated work to coordinate and support a series of research projects, all focused on analgesic clinical trial design and product development. Through the ACTP, FDA and academia are identifying scientific gaps in the aforementioned areas, prioritizing projects based on public health needs and implementing them through the leveraging of resources and technical expertise from multiple partners.

In spite of the enormous advances in drug development over the past two or three decades, (e.g., drugs that cure cancer, biologic drug products that halt the progression of rheumatoid arthritis), the development of novel analgesic drug products has seriously lagged behind.  Indeed, to this day, the only analgesic drug products that are used widely and successfully are opioids, acetaminophen and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), all of which have serious, potentially life-threatening toxicities even when used properly. While there has been exploration at the earliest stages of drug development, there has been wide'-spread reluctance on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to take novel products further into development. This is in no small part due to the often daunting task of demonstrating the efficacy of analgesics in clinical trials. Many experts in analgesic drug development believe that it is the design of the clinical trials that is - at fault in this situation, and that better trial designs will yield more successful results. This hypothesis is certainly supported by the frequent failures of clinical efficacy trials of opioid drug products, considering the well established effectiveness of these products from literally thousands of years of clinical experience.  

IV. Objective:
FDA wishes to engage contractors to provide research and assistance in developing statistical methodologies to examine the use, in peri-operative pain trials, of combined pain scores and scores of rescue medication use for comparisons of differences in effect between study treatments.

V.  Scope of Work: 
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services necessary for performance of the work as described below.  

The contractor shall specify the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key tasks identified.  All data and outcomes associated with this scope of work shall be provided to and go through the Project Officer (PO), to the FDA.  A final report shall be prepared by the contractor that summarizes the deliverables of this contract. 

The contractor shall identify clinical trials evaluating the analgesic effects of various treatments in patients also receiving intravenous opioid and other rescue medication during the peri-operative period.

The contractor shall, based on expert feedback and in collaboration with FDA staff, compile a list of possible statistical procedures for combined analysis of pain and analgesic rescue scores and determine which methods are best suited for analysis of the data.

The contractor shall then further evaluate the aforementioned data using the identified statistical methods, to determine which analysis methods will potentially provide evidence of treatment efficacy when it truly exists, and avoid false negative as well as false positive results. 

The contractor shall lead the development of appropriate publication/s and/or report/s, in collaboration with FDA staff on summaries and other finding from this Statement of Work, the number and content of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the contractor and the FDA Project Officer.

<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 541690. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s):</p>
<p>CLIN No. 0001 Videograpic surveys Qty 5 EA</p>
<p>CLIN No. 0002 Report Qty 1 EA</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory has a requirement for monthly surveys of Chesapeake Bay menhaden concentrations through the summer of 2008. <br /><br />Task 1. Obtain and integrate camera, computer, and related videography system into existing camera mount system and aircraft. The survey hardware will be supplied to the contractor, who will be responsible for the obtaining aircraft services and integrating the equipment into the aircraft. This must be accomplished in advance of the first acquisition mission to ensure everything is functioning properly and that the pilot and flight technician understand the mission needs. The contractor will arrange for bench testing of the equipment and mount, then transfer the equipment to the aircraft for testing. Task 1 will be completed as soon as possible after receiving a notice to proceed.</p>
<p>Task 2. Plan survey routes, dates of survey, and other mission-related actions. Task 2 will commence after the notification to proceed. The contractor will familiarize themselves with all the protocols for mission planning and schedule the flights to take place monthly from the beginning of the project through September. Dates will be flexible depending on weather, but advanced notice will minimize issues related to pilot availability and travel arrangements.</p>
<p>Task 3. Complete monthly surveys of the Chesapeake Bay according to established protocols. The contractor will complete five videography surveys of the Chesapeake Bay (roughly one per month) from the beginning of the project through September, following the protocols established by NOAA. Surveys will be carried out during times of acceptable weather conditions and over successive days whenever possible. Acceptable survey weather requires more stringent conditions than safe flight - clear skies and low winds are required for good data collection. An average of 20 hours per month of aircraft time is anticipated.</p>
<p>Task 4. Deliver acquired data monthly to the sponsor<br />Upon successful completion of each monthly data gathering mission, the contractor will send a copy of the recorded data, along with any other pertinent ancillary information, to the NOAA on BluRay disk. <br /><br />Task 5. Complete a final project report outlining all project activities in detail. Upon completion of the final survey mission, the contractor will compile and deliver a report outlining all project activity including dates of flights, time spent, and other information to support our activities related to the project. In addition, this report will contain any observations, recommendations, or other information that may be deemed useful by the NOAA for future surveys of this type.</p>
<p>Task 6. Learn data processing techniques for subsequent work. The contractor will provide some assistance in processing the video data using the techniques developed by the NOAA. The primary objective in this pilot work would be to learn the techniques used by NOAA to identify menhaden schools using the "semi-supervised" classification technique.</p>
<p>Survey protocol<br />Transect lines should cross the bay with heading directly east or directly west. North/south spacing of the lines should be 2 minutes of latitude. Altitude should be at or below 5000 feet. Any survey speed is acceptable. Surveys should be done with winds under 6 knots, cloud cover less than 15 %, and solar zenith angle greater than the field of view of the camera. That angle is about 35 degrees at a flight altitude of 1000 feet, decreasing to about 8 degrees at a flight altitude of 5000 feet.</p>
<p>(VII) Place of delivery of the data is NOAA/ESRL/CSD, 325 Broadway, R/CSD1, Boulder, CO 80305. Delivery shall be FOB Destination.</p>

a. They must be clearly organized and formatted to provide quick and easy access for enforcement personnel to the appropriate section of the regulations.  As many sections of the regulations reference other sections, section references should be clearly linked for quicker reference by enforcement personnel. For the total license fee, supplier grants to the USCG, for the period from 1 September 2008 through 31 August 2009, the irrevocable, non-exclusive right to use, store, reproduce in any medium, or transmit in any form or by any means, all the data and updates (deliverables) described in this SOW; supplier retains the right to sell or otherwise market to any other entity or individual the data and service covered by this SOW.

b. They must be kept up-to-date with updates provided to the Coast Guard on a regular basis, at a minimum monthly.

c. They must contain all appropriate parts of Titles 15, 46 (Part 28 only) and 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations that are enforced by the Coast Guard.  Current regulations being provided include 50 CFR 216, 222, 223, 224, 226, 229, 230, 300, 403, 600, 622, 635, 640, 648, 654, 660, 665, 679, and 697; 15 CFR 904 and 922; 46 CFR 28 and the Lacey Act, 16 USC 3371-3378.

d. They must be provided in electronic .chm format, windows CE and Palm format.  The supplier should be able to provide at the request of field units a paper copy of all or portions of these regulationsexcluding regulations applicable to the U.S. west coastin the form of its Books GEN, ADM, NE/MA, and SA/C/G, paid for by the requesting units at a cost in addition to this contract.  Paper copy service should also include a monthly update feature.

The USCG will ensure that the data provided to it under this agreement, in whatever form, is protected from use by anyone outside the Coast Guard.  Excerpts from the regulations will be allowed to be used by the Coast Guard for inclusion in law enforcement case packages and other official purposes, whereby the information will be transferred outside the Coast Guard.

2. In addition, supplier will maintain the existing Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) regulated areas database.  This database consolidates all the geographically defined regulatory areas in the federal marine fisheries regulations into one Excel file so that these areas may be imported into Coast Guard command and control systems.  Supplier will need to provide all areas that are promulgated as final regulations, provided that can be done on the basis of the regulatory text, plus use of MapTech software for the sole purpose of creating latitude and longitude points for land intersections described in the regulations.  For this purpose, the USCG will provide the supplier with MapTech software program and data disks.  Updates must be provided on a regular basis, at a minimum monthly.  VMS updates should be formatted identically to that being used at present (Microsoft Excel spreadsheets), and updated files will be transmitted via e-mail.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCEThe Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), a sole source purchase order with Invitrogen Coporation, 3175 Staley Rd, Grand Island, NY 14072-2028, for the purchase of a ProtoArray Discovery Bundle, 80 Array.  This procurement is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     The VA Palo Alto has a requirement for a ProtoArray Discovery Bundle in support of research on the exact autoantigen targets in multiple sclerosis and other diseases that afflict Veterans.  ProtoArrays are human protein microarrays, with each array containing more than 8,000 human proteins that have been recombinantly expressed in a baculovirus system, purified, and printed on the arrays.  The human proteins printed on ProtoArrays are functional, have sequence-verified DNA clones available for follow-up work, and are vital for antigen (protein) and biomarker discovery for other human diseases.   The ProtoArray Discovery Bundle, 80 Array is currently the only human protein array available that offers more than 250 human proteins.  Alternative approaches including peptide arrays, immunoblotting and mass spectroscopy will not support the large-scale survey of human proteins required for this research.The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12 -Acquisition for Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  All FAR provisions and clauses may be reviewed and/or obtained from the General Service Internet address: http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This Notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDAs capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team.  The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDAs capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Operations Liaison Unit (OLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.

INTRODUCTION

The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of OLU.  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/M will be located within the OPSs OLU and functions as the Divisions principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DoD).

OBJECTIVE

HAA/Ms provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The HAA/M will be a member of OLU.  There may be an initial training program in Washington, DC for up to one year, which will include formal classroom training and on-the-job training; and may include security training.

After completion of Washington training, HAA/Ms may be assigned to Washington, other locations in the United States, or an overseas office, and will be required to serve through rotational assignments.  At any time, at the discretion of OFDA Headquarters, the incumbent may be reassigned/relocated to a geographical location where the individuals services are needed.

Travel is required to attend DoD conferences, exercises and other related activities on behalf of USAID, OFDA, a particular DART or RMT and/or a CBRNE planning exercise as directed by the OFDA/OPS Division Chief through the OLU Leader.

The incumbents duties and responsibilities will include the following:
	Coordinate with the humanitarian community to achieve the best use of military assets by reducing redundant or counterproductive military activities;
	Assist the military in defining and reconciling its role with that of the greater humanitarian relief community;
	Seek out methods to most effectively utilize DoD strengths;
	Represent OFDA in appropriate DoD training and planning exercises with subsequent reporting to OFDA divisions on activities, lessons learned, success and future activities as a result of OFDA participation;
	Represent OFDA in DoD conferences in the context of priorities set forth by the OPS Division Chief, such as, participate  in After-action Reviews (AARs), humanitarian exercises sponsored at the Combatant Command level and at operational level and strategic planning exercises normally conducted through Pentagon auspices to interact with policy makers;
	Assist OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DoD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
	Determine whether OFDA participation in DoD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
	Provide OFDA briefings and training to uniformed military officers at various DoD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
	Coordinate with DoD and the Department of States Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DoD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
	Deploy with DoD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
	Provide reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OLU Team Leader and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;
	Assist in the identification of OFDAs DRM Division deployment needs in designated "at risk" countries where DARTs may deploy; work with other teams within OFDA to determine appropriate DART needs as a basis for contingency planning for personnel and resources;
	Deploy to the field as a DART member, as necessary;
	Assist the OLU in providing classified USG information support to OFDA as requested and to selected DARTs and RMTs on an as-needed basis;
	Assist regional Combatant Commanders (COCOMs)  in developing the humanitarian assistance aspect of their strategic operations and crisis action planning products; and
	Liaise with the DoD and other elements of the USG in an effort to help the military coordinate with the humanitarian community.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the OPS OLU Leader in Washington, DC.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The incumbent and the Supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The employee is expected to take initiative, act independently and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies and military liaison activities as part of a fast-paced office environment.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>**SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR WHITE PAPERS HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 1700 MDT 2 JUNE 2008.**<BR><BR>1.	Through this solicitation, is there any specific application scenario, other than the one suggested, which the UAST program is interested in addressing?<BR><BR>Response: Generally speaking, implications throughout the BAA make references to application scenarios within System of Systems and Complex System mission scenarios.  Suggest the Offeror address those sections of the BAA related to the scenarios.  If the Offeror has additional specific application scenarios associated please provide.   <BR><BR><BR>2.	How will the progress of this project be monitored?<BR><BR>Response: The following processes will be used to monitor progress:<BR>	a) Plant visits to physically check on progress made on the Project<BR>	b) Offeror will provide monthly status reports due on the 10th of each month for the prior month.<BR>	c) Phone/e-mail.  Periodically, the Government COR will call or e-mail the Offeror requesting information related to the Project<BR>	d) Phase Deliverables:<BR>	   1.) Demonstrations<BR>	   2.) Documentation<BR>	   3.) Software/Hardware<BR>	   4.) Mandatory and Voluntarily Conference Meetings W/OSD to present/promote status of project<BR>      e) Measures of progress will be established and monitored with periodics assessment<BR>	<BR> <BR>3.	Does this program emphasize the project to use any specific commercially available software for development of this system?<BR><BR>Response: The Government cannot dictate commercially available software for the development of this system and is left up to the Offeror's to select the appropriate software required to accomplish the task.  <BR><BR>4.	Does the above described approach to testing and evaluation address the T&E goals set for the UAST program? <BR><BR>Response:  The Government has conducted extensive research and has also consulted with SME to address the T&E goals for the UAST program.  If the Offeror feels that he/she has a better approach, then please present it within the confines of the White Paper.<BR><BR>5.  Are you looking for submissions that encompass an entire technical area, e.g. 1. UAST Modeling and Architecture?<BR><BR>Response:  See page 18 of the BAA once again for examples of possible submittals.  The subitems in the Appendix were provided as guidance for the scope of each of the four major TTA areas.  It is assumed that the Offeror has a certain level of expertise in; i.e. subject matter expert (SME) field(s) being addressed by the BAA.  Proposed White Paper(s) may encompass portions or entire technical areas.  However, the Offeror should review the BAA section/instructions White Paper(s) submissions.<BR><BR>6.       The BAA calls for innovative research and development concepts focused in the area of Unmanned and Autonomous System Testing (UAST). In the technical areas of interest cited, is the call for:<BR><BR>a.       Conducting flight testing or field testing of new technologies being developed under either corporate internal research and development or other government sponsored research and development? or <BR><BR>Response:  Proposed T&E testing is under the 6.3 funding banner. As a consequence, the Department of Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) is looking for new and innovative ideas that address the testing requirements of the UAST BAA.  Also, as long as the proposed T&E testing for UAS is under those guidelines, it doesn't matter whether corporate internal research and development of other government sponsored research and development are derived.  <BR><BR>b.       New ideas and/or methods for testing relevant new and emerging technologies?<BR><BR>Response:  Proposed T&E testing of UAST testing again must invoke new and innovative technologies that are in the TRL levels specified on page 17 of the BAA<BR><BR>7.       In the technical areas of interest cited, is there any intent to fund further development of the new technologies to facilitate testing, or is the intent only to fund those technologies that are ready for test?<BR><BR>Response:  <BR>	a) If at the end of the Project (Period of Performances -Phases I-In + Any Options)the proposed T&E testing of UAST is delivered and demonstrated and OSD is convinced that it has merit, the project will further be funded (multiple quantities) and go into production via the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP).  <BR>	b) The intent here is to fund those technologies to meet the 6.3 funding criteria within the TRL levels, PLEASE refer to page 17 for clarification<BR><BR><BR>8.       If the intent is to fund flight / field test activities only, does the Army possess test platforms (UAVs, etc.) that they intend the technology testing to be conducted with? Or does the Army anticipate contractors will provide their own test platform assets to support the testing?<BR><BR>Response:  <BR>	a) The funding spectrum is for all UAS types (Space to Underwater) The Army does posses some ground test platforms that can be used.  In addition, since this is an OSD (Purple) program, the Army/WSMR is in collaboration with the other services (Army, Navy, Air Force) to address UAS testing of other platforms.  <BR><BR>	b) Perspective Offerors can provide their own surrogate platforms to demonstrate their T&E technology.  Surrogate platforms can either be optionally used for demonstration and or become part of the T&E UAST deliverable. <BR><BR>9.       Are there expected funding levels associated with any anticipated awards?<BR><BR>Response:  Yes there are.  Typically, on the average the funding levels ranged from $300K to $500K per period of performance (POP).  However, the Offeror is not precluded to include options that correspond to proposed phases and associated POPs. Typically project should not exceed three years.  However, if the White Paper merits higher funding levels because of some really innovative 6.3 technology, we can take proposal to OSD approval.  If OSD approves, then funding levels can increase accordingly.<BR><BR>10.	Is the quad chart included in the 15 page limit?<BR><BR>Response:  The 15 page limit has an additional page; namely the cover page (15+1=16).  However, all appendixes i.e.; the quad chart is Appendix F and a consequently a separate page and not to be considered to be part of the 15 page limit.<BR><BR>11.	Is the WBS included in the 15 page limit?<BR><BR>Response: The WBS is Appendix H and consequently a separate page.  <BR><BR>12.	On page 28 of the BAA, paragraph ii, the solicitation refers to the first 10 pages and then the first 13 pages. Which is correct? Should the WBS and quad chart be inserted in this section?<BR><BR>Response:  <BR>	a)  Offeror should disregard the paragraph that starts out with The first ten pages ..... Paragraph ii, should read: The first thirteen pages should serve to provide an overview with a clear and concise technical description of the effort proposed.  Figures, schematics, drawings tables, charts, etc., shall follow associated technical descriptions.  The format below should be covered in the thirteen pages.  <BR><BR>	b)  The WBS is Appendix H and yes it is a separate page.<BR><BR>	c)  The quad chart is also an appendix and should be Appendix F - a separate page and not Appendix E as stated on page 26, line item number 5.<BR><BR>	d)  On Page 26, reference to line item number 6 Provide a separate Microsoft Project file of the Gantt chart (See Appendix F).  That Appendix should be Appendix G<BR><BR>13.	Where are the white paper submission instructions?<BR><BR>Response: See Page 25, Part II White Paper Preparation and Submission<BR><BR>14.	Is it permissible to email the white papers to you on Monday, 5/19 rather than express mailing CD ROMs?<BR><BR>Response:	We take careful steps to guard proprietary information contained in each and every one of the White Paper submittals and discourage use of e-mail for this purpose. The Government cannot be held liable for compromise of this type of information when it's being transmitted via the Web and the fact that the information lives in the servers and such.  <BR><BR>Also, we fully realize that the transmitted e-mail information can be encrypted, but then this is subject to miss-matching communication problems at both ends and usually turns out to be greater effort involved just to send and receive the documents.  <BR><BR>To keep things running smoothly, we must insist that all Offerors submit their White Papers in accordance with the UAST BAA0002 instructions; via CD-ROM

<DESC>The following are more vendor questions and the Government's response: QUESTION:  The only stipulation I saw was that the facility must be within the Greenville city limits. Our closest . . . facility is in Morehead City NC. Please advise me if you would like . . . to continue to submit a proposal. ANSWER:  There are 2 solicitations for Radiology Services:  1 for Morehead City, NC (VA-246-08-RP-0055) and 1 for Greenville (VA-246-08-RP-0056).  Offerors must reside in the city limits of Morehead City, NC, if applying to VA-246-08-RP-0055, and/or Greenville, NC, if applying to VA-246-08-RP-0056.   QUESTION:  Do you have the FAR that allows a physician to work at a Federal Facility with any state license. I know it is done all the time and is definitely allowable, I am just having difficulty finding the FAR that permits it. ANSWER:  A physician or anyone else can work at any VA as long as they have a valid license in ANY state.  There is no FAR reference. QUESTION:  We can provide the personnel to obtain Mammos, CT, DX, MRI, etc but we do not provide the equipment.  Is this a bid for both? ANSWER:  Yes, the Statement of Work (SOW) states:  "The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, facility, professional and technical personnel services to provide routine x-ray, mammography, and ultrasound studies for eligible veteran beneficiaries as referred by the Department of Veteran Affairs, Morehead City Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), 5420 Highway 70 West, Morehead City, NC, 28734."   QUESTION:  Could you please tell me the dollar value on each soliciations? and the number of exams performed?  I know in a previous question asked you stated that no historical numbers for diagnostic x-rays are available, but do you have a round about figure?   ANSWER:  We cannot share the result of the Government's independent cost estimate for these solicitations.  The figures contained in the Cost/Price Schedule are the Government's estimate for the number of exams to be performed.  No other data is available.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR FINE CHINAWARE

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a contractor to provide high quality fine china for official U. S. Government representational residences overseas. The china must be vitrified and free of imperfections or blemishes. The crested and uncrested china patterns used by the Department of State have been in existence for more than fifty years. The contractor that is awarded the contract shall be required to duplicate the color, size, shape, and decorations of the existing chinaware. The contractor must have a warehouse facility to stockpile the chinaware for delivery orders and to accommodate all other packing and shipping requirements. All chinaware produced under this contract shall be stored in the Continental United States at the contractors expense until ordered out by the Department of State. At present, there are approximately 2,000 cubic feet of chinaware owned by the U.S. Government being stored at the present contractors warehouse. The contractor selected for this award shall receive and accept the existing stock of chinaware and maintain it according to the terms and conditions of the chinaware contract. This procurement will be a 100% set-aside for small business. North American Industry Classification System Code is 327112. Award of a Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract, with a base year and four, one-year option periods is anticipated.

A pre-solicitation conference will be held at 10:00 AM, EST on Wednesday, May 28, 2008 at 1701 N. Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA  22209.  All interested parties must sign-up to attend the pre-solicitation conference no later than May 23, 2008.  Only up to two (2) representatives from each company are permitted, and attendees must submit identifying information for entrance to the pre-solicitation conference.  Please bring a valid picture ID to check in at the Guard Desk at 1701 N. Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA .  Please send the following information no later than 5:00 PM, EST on May 23, 2008 to Blondell Taylor at e-mail address: TaylorBK2@state.gov : (1) company name, (2) name(s) of up to two representatives, address(es), phone number(s), and e-mail address(es).  At the pre-solicitation conference, each represented company will receive a broken piece of DoS china for comparison purposes.  Companies must be present at the pre-solicitation conference to receive a sample and to be considered for award.

For further consideration interested companies that attended the pre-solicitation conference will be required to submit a representative sample of their work, consisting of one gold-rimmed, charger plate and one gold-rimmed tea cup, both should be: (1) high quality fine china; (2) ivory in color; and (3) true vitrified fine china, free of imperfection or blemishes.  DoS will require those companies in the pre-solicitation conference that wish to compete for the above mentioned contract to provide representative samples of fine chinaware to DoS/OBO no later than 4:00 PM EST, Wednesday, June 11, 2008 to the following address:  (for Courier address: Attn:  Blondell Taylor, A/LM/AQM/FDCD/MS, Suite L-600, 1701 N. Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA  22209, Phone No. (703) 875-6961; For U. S. Postal Address:  Blondell Taylor, A/LM/AQM/FDCD/MS, Suite L-600, PO Box 9115, Arlington, VA  22219.  You must attend the pre-solicitation conference to be eligible to submit the fine chinaware sample.  Submitted chinaware samples will not be returned to the companies.

The government intends to evaluate this project under lowest price, technically acceptable and do so under a two step evaluation process.  First step:  The companies submissions of the representative sample chinaware will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis.  Only companies receiving a pass rating after the governments technical evaluation of the sample chinaware as described in this pre-solicitation notice will be eligible to receive the Request for Proposal and in turn submit a proposal to the government.

<DESC>Transcription Services SolicitationSolicitation No. VA-101-08-RQ-0154Responses to Vendor QuestionsQ1. On the price list (Attachment A), are the day turnaround times supposed to be 10, 3-5, and 1 day instead of 10, 10, and 10?R1. The descriptions in the price list (Attachment A) are hereby changed to Basic Transcription  10 Day Turnaround, Basic Transcription  5 Day Turnaround, and Basic Transcription  1 Day Turnaround.  Q2.  Is there an estimated volume of work (in lines or minutes of dictation) or am I overlooking it somewhere?R2. The solicitation does not contain an estimated volume of work.  The volume of work will vary.Q3. Would it be possible to allow a company to perform outside of the DC area with a secure network?R3. As stated on page 11 of the solicitation, the VA OIG uses audio cassette tapes and digital records to record interviews.  The vendor will be required to physically pick-up the audio cassette tapes and then physically deliver the printed transcribed testimonies to the VA OIG.  The transcriptions are often time critical.  Therefore, the vendor must be within the Washington, DC area.   Q4. It is requested that this procurement be made a SDVOSB set-aside.R4. The Department of Veteran Affairs requires transcription services on a recurring basis from a company located in the Washington, DC area.  The volume of work may vary throughout the year.  A determination was made to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement with a ceiling of $1,000,000 over the course of five years.  Therefore, this procurement will not be a SDVOSB set-aside.
