Although the prime contract period of performance ended 30 Sept 2012, the FISAC contracts were still not ready for award. As a result, a sole source three year (one basic year, plus two 12 month options) contract known as the Partial Bridge Contract (PBC) was awarded to Northrop Grumman in order to bridge the original ICBM support and sustainment contract to the new FISAC contractors. The PBC sustainment support includes systems engineering, sustaining engineering, and program management support, and assist with knowledge transfer to the new contractors being awarded FISAC contracts. The PBC support was/is responsible for Integrated Support (ISC), Ground, Guidance, RSRV, Propulsion, and miscellaneous F-900 programs. Of those aforementioned efforts placed on the PBC in 2012, all FISAC contracts, but Propulsion, have been awarded and are currently transitioning. Award of the Propulsion portion of the FISAC contract is still in process.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-       8116, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.

Additionally, the University is the source of the finished desk design.
This is not a request for quotes however; all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979.

<DESC>The goal of the Manufacturer Direct Program is to establish an alternative to manual open market purchase activity, re-engineer the business process with automated e-commerce business solution. The objective of this solicitation is to establish a Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with Zimmer US, Inc. for their hip, knee, spine, extremity (shoulders and elbows), trauma "procedural packages," orthobiological products, auxiliary products (such as drill bits, saw blades, bone cement etc.) and instrumentation sets needed for implantation. Other Zimmer Orthopedic product groups determined to be in the scope of the contract may be solicited at a future date under this solicitation.
<p>There are (2) two delivery methods (Just-In-Time (JIT) and Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD)) utilized to support DLA customers' requirement for orthopedic "procedural packages". Under the JIT delivery method, the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) will call the sales representative when a surgery is scheduled to discuss the case, make a product selection and inform him or her of the surgery date and time. The manufacturer's representative will transport the "procedural package" to the designated site at the scheduled time. The representative may be requested by the MTFs to have in their possession a number of "back-up" components available to the physician during the entire procedure. Under the DVD method, MTFs may order product in advance of a scheduled surgery or purchase replacement inventory on an as needed basis. Under this method all items are packaged for shipment to the delivery point cited on the purchase order.</p>
<p>This solicitation also contains an on-site personnel requirement for the contractor to provide advice and guidance to physician's before, during and after implantation of the device at the request of the Medical Treatment Facility. Technical support shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.</p>
<p>Market Research has revealed that there are no other manufacturers or distributors other than Zimmer who can provide DoD hospitals with the complete Zimmer "Procedural Package" (Zimmer Orthopedic implants, use of the instrumentation sets, orthobiological products and the auxiliary products) at the required time for surgery and be available on-site if needed to answer questions on all these products. The Zimmer Sales Representatives are experts on Zimmer's products and are a vital part of helping to ensure that the patient is getting the necessary treatment. Only Zimmer has these capabilities.</p>
<p>Zimmer will have their product line loaded in the DLA Troop Support Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT). All Orders, Order Acknowledgements and Invoice transactions are required to be electronic. Items will be delivered to various Department of Defense (DoD) research centers, hospitals, and clinics, and any federal customer participating in this program.</p>
<p>The term of the contract will be a one-year Base Period and four one-year unilateral Option Periods. This procurement has an estimated value of approximately $6.3 Million for the Base Period and the first option period (if exercised), $6.4 million each for the second and third option periods (if exercised), and $6.5 million for the fourth option periods (if exercised), for a total of approximately $32 million over the five-year life of the procurement.</p>
<p>Solicitation SPE2DE-15-R-0001 is expected to be issued June 01, 2015 and can be found on the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. The point of contact is John R. Jackson, DSCP-FSCB, 215-737-0850, john.r.jackson@dla.mil. The solicitation will not become available until the solicitation issue date.</p>

The period of performance shall be a Base period (award through 9/30/2015) and four (4) one-year Options. This is a pre-solicitation notice for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 5.203(a), as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. The acquisition will be a set-aside 100% for small business in accordance with FAR 19. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, with a small business size standard of $15,000,000.00. Evaluation and award will be made in accordance with FAR 15.101-1, Tradeoff Process.
I.	A summary of the evaluation criteria used for source selection is listed below to assist you in determining your qualifications for this solicitation:

A.	Factor # 1 - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

The evaluation will be divided into four (4) sub-factors and supporting criteria. Sub-factor 1, Professional Certifications/Degrees, is more important than sub-factor 2.

Sub-Factor 1: Professional Certifications/Degrees & Experience -
"	Bachelor Degree in a medical or scientific field with five years or more research monitoring experience, or
"	Licensed Health Care Professional with five years or more research monitoring experience.  
"	Experience: This applies to both the Offeror and its staff, and will determine Offeror's ability to provide qualified staff and required licensing under this contract. The Offeror shall identify that it has qualified staff to provide services indicated in the solicitation, which offer the most likelihood of successful performance.   
"	Current copy of certification (i.e., Specialty/Sub-specialty, ACRP, SCRA, etc.) 
"	Copy of resume of curriculum vitae with a minimum of 3 current references 
"	Research Experience (preferred)

Sub-Factor 2: Safeguarding of Patient Health Information (PHI) - 
"	Describe Offeror's procedures used to safeguard VA patient records under this contract.  The Offeror's approach should include documentation of physical security of records and steps taken to prevent disclosure of an individual record, report or other private information of the patient. 

Sub-Factor 3: Technical Abilities/Capabilities
"	Basic Computer knowledge 
"	Software knowledge in Microsoft Office Programs (e.g. Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.)
"	Human Subjects and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) Certification (Preferred)

Sub-Factor 4: Veteran Preference
In an effort to achieve socioeconomic small business goals, depending on the evaluation factors included in the solicitation, VA may evaluate Offerors based on their veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned status, their proposed use of veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors, and their past performance on adherence to subcontracting plan requirements.

B.	Factor # 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE:

The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the Past Performance of the Offeror as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the work required by the solicitation.  The Past Performance proposal evaluation will consider such things as an Offeror's business practices, customer relationship, and ability to successfully perform as proposed. For the purpose of this solicitation, currency is performance occurring within the last five (5) years through the solicitation release date. Past Performance includes current on-going (present) performance. Relevance will also be evaluated in the overall Past Performance rating (i.e. very relevant, semi-relevant, and not relevant). Ratings will consider the Offeror's Past Performance considering currency, relevancy, sources, context, and trends. 

C.	Factor #3 - PRICE

"	The Government evaluation team will conduct a Price evaluation of each Offeror's Pricing Schedule to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness". If the proposed price is determined to be reasonable, a REASONABLE rating will be given; if found to be unreasonable, an UNREASONABLE rating will be assigned to the price evaluation factor.
"	Prices will also be analyzed to determine whether they are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of requirements, and are consistent with the corresponding Technical Proposal. Proposals must include the cost of the entire service including overhead and profit.

II.	A condensed version of the SOW has been enclosed for your review.

<a href="mailto:tracy.worrell@va.gov">tracy.worrell@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center (VAMC) located in Palo Alto, California requires off-site urgent care services for veterans.  The American Academy of Urgent Care defines urgent care as "the provision of immediate medical services offering outpatient care for the treatment of acute and chronic illness and injury."   For the purposes of this contract, the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) seeks services at the lower end of the severity spectrum, such as for minor illnesses, coughs, colds, rashes, and sprains.  X-ray and lab services are not necessary to meet the requirements of this contract.  Pharmacy services, however, specifically a 10-day supply of a VA-approved formulary of medications, are necessary. 
These urgent care services should be available at locations within approximately 40 miles driving distance of most veterans in the Palo Alto catchment (see map attached).  It is not necessary for the contractor to have facilities close to every veteran, but the awardee will have facilities within 40 miles of approximately 90 percent of veterans in this catchment.  These services will be available upon referral by VAPAHCS, seven days per week, and after 4:30pm on weeknights.
VAPAHCS staff shall refer all eligible veterans to these urgent care facilities and it is the responsibility of the contractor to evaluate the veteran and provide appropriate care.  Should the veteran require services beyond the scope of the urgent care facility's services, it is the responsibility of the contractor to refer the veteran back to VAPAHCS sites, including the VAPAHCS emergency room.  It is critical that the contractor participate in electronic communication with the VA or a third-party vendor to facilitate data exchange.  An electronic medical record that allows for third-party data exchange is an important feature of this contact.  
2.  SPECIFIC CONTRACTOR TASKS 
Contractor shall provide the following services to veterans:
2.1.	SERVICES REQUIRED:
2.1.1.	 Minor Illnesses: The contractor shall be responsible for providing care for minor illness such as bronchitis and coughs, sore throat, upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections (in women), flu-like symptoms, and other, similar minor illnesses. 
2.1.2.	 Minor Injuries:  The contractor shall be responsible for providing care for minor injuries such as bug bites, minor burns, minor cuts, sprains and strains of the knee and ankle, suture removal, and other, similar minor illnesses.
2.1.3.	 Screenings and Monitoring: The contractor shall be responsible for providing urgent blood pressure monitoring, glucose checks, and other health screenings.  
2.1.4.	 Skin Conditions:  The contractor shall be responsible for providing management of acne, fungal infections, mouth sores, eczema, impetigo, shingles, sunburn, and other minor skin conditions.
2.1.5.	 Pharmacy: An on-site pharmacy for the dispensing of an agreed-upon formulary to veterans who require prescriptions must be available.

<DESC>The Dyess Air Force Base existing taxiway Alpha was constructed in the 1950s, and the taxiway pavement is approaching the end of its useful life. The paving is in a deteriorated condition, which creates a higher risk of foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft that could negatively impact the mission of the base. This has created a need for a higher level of preventative maintenance. The scope for the project is to saw cut and remove the existing concrete slab taxiway, which is 10,000' long and 125' wide. It will be replaced with new concrete slab paving of mainly two sizes with reinforcement and joint seals to protect against water intrusion, ensure proper load transfer, and maintain a level profile. The construction of the new paving will include sub base layers and materials to provide suitable structural stability and drainage characteristics. Additionally, the existing 9' of asphalt shoulder will be removed and replaced. The construction staging is anticipated to require four phases over one year of construction, moving from south to north. <br> POC: Julie Meyer, Email: julie.meyer@usace.army.mil <br>   <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District Office requires a contract to perform shoreline stabilization for approximately 1,000 feet at Placement Area (PA) 15 and approximately 2,800 feet at Mid Bay PA in order to repair eroded areas. Approximately 43,656 tons of riprap and 15,380 tons of blanket stone will be required to repair eroded areas.  Riprap will be approximately 42 quote mark  stone between 210 and 3,565 pounds and blanket stone will be between   quote mark  and 200 pound stone.  Contractors will first remove existing stone from eroded areas along Mid Bay PA and PA 15 and stockpile at specified area between PA's 14 and 15.  A potential Option exists for disposal of rock removed from Mid Bay PA and PA15 at Marsh Cell M10 in lieu of stockpiling at specified area between PA's 14 and 15; however, rock already disposed of at stockpile location will not need to be relocated if option is exercised.  Option for disposal of rock at Marsh Cell M10 will likely require contractor to dig access channels.  Access channel(s) will have to be excavated mechanically (clamshell or bucket - no cutterhead dredge) and will need to be backfilled on completion of the work. Order of work will require erosion repair to be conducted at Mid Bay Placement Area first due to a Migratory bird window. No work allowed at Mid Bay PA between 3/1/16 and 8/31/16 unless cleared by US Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.

<DESC>RFI Title: Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Technologies. <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES. <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CP&I) is conducting market research to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide multimodal Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technologies to accommodate Mission Command functions for use by future dismounted Leaders and Soldiers.   <br> Background and Description: <br> The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power and Integration (CP&I) is trying to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide multimodal Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technologies to accommodate Mission Command functions for use by future dismounted Leaders and Soldiers.  The ultimate goal of implementing a HCI system is to create a natural, intuitive and immersive interaction experience for Commanders and Soldiers. Current Mission Command systems typically permit keyboard, mouse, or even touch input as a single-mode of interaction. The requested HCI system will be organic to the Soldier for use in urban, remote and austere environments where there is limited or no communication networks.  <br> The CP&I goal is to determine which HCI technologies offer a more intuitive means of interacting with software to improve Army Leaders' ability to access and interact with information, thereby reducing cognitive load to combat information overload during the decision making process.  In addition, it is believed a more natural way of interacting with Mission Command software shall reduce the learning curve and improve retention, while soldiers learn how to use Mission Command software, perform Mission Command tasks, and execute After Action Reviews. <br> The target platform for this RFI is the Program Executive Office - Soldier (PEO Soldier), Project Manager Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR) existing and future Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs), and should be compatible with Soldier protective equipment.  Existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) technologies, as well as long term technologies leading up to 2025 are sought. <br> Technologies shall be used in any or all battlefield environments from noisy and silent (covert) to hostile and benign.  Combining these modalities would provide Commanders with a more natural means of interacting with Mission Command information.   <br> These desired capabilities for the system are requested to include, but not be limited to the following: <br>  	Input / Output <br> o	Hands-free operation preferred <br> o	Multi-modal capability: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), gesture, touch, eye tracking, Haptic, Force Feedback, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) <br> o	One-hand operation with protective hand wear <br> o	Touch screen and/or easy-to-use button wheel control <br>  	Wearable, adaptive displays <br>  	Readable displays in all light conditions and usable with Night Vision Goggles (NVG) without backlighting <br>  	Low Power consumption, Lightweight, Flexible and Durable <br>  	Compatible with Android Operating System (OS) <br> This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought announcement. Responses will assist the Government in determining potential responsible sources and to determine the technical capability of the domestic production base.    <br> Requested Information:   <br> The Government is requesting contractors provide sufficient information in the form of a white paper which should include a description of the capabilities, technical expertise, and relevant past experience.

<DESC>Scope of Work: <br> The U.S. Army Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PMFSS) is conducting market research regarding industry's interest and capability in providing up to 60 Containerized Ice Making Systems (CIMS). This is not a request for proposal. This notice is only to request information, which may assist the Government in developing future procurement strategies. The CIMS will improve soldier health and well-being by providing consumable ice at the point of consumption, the Force Provider Expeditionary (FPE) camp. A FPE module supports full spectrum operations by providing the Army with a rapidly deployable, containerized, and prepackaged environmentally controlled base camp life support capability for 150 personnel equipped for feeding, billeting, and hygiene (laundry, shower, and latrine). The CIMS shall consist of a self-contained system that can produce and bag 3600 Lbs. of consumable ice/day. The detailed requirements will be in the form of a performance-based specification rather than detailed drawings and specifications. Ahead of production will be a design and development phase during which a vendor or vendors would design and build a CIMS for qualification testing. Much of the design may include modifying or enhancing commercial ice makers, ice baggers and freezers to create a rugged, expeditionary system suitable for military use, and a system that meets all of the performance requirements below. Initial development indicates that commercial ice makers face stiff challenges meeting the requirements for military transport, maintenance, storage and high temperature operation. There are also logistics support requirements associated with CIMS, including development of military technical manuals, training courses and explanatory DVDs. <br>  <br> Key CIMS Performance Requirements: <br> * The largest material handling equipment available to move and set up the system is a forklift with 10k pound lift capacity. <br> *When transported to or from the expeditionary site the entire CIMS shall fit within the footprint of no more than the equivalent of one ISO container of 8'x8'x20'L (e.g., may also use two 10-foot long containers or three 6.6-foot long containers). <br> * Containerized systems shall be capable of 9-high stack for marine transport <br> * The system shall be compatible with available electric power at a contingency basecamp, 50/60Hz, 120/208 and/or 240/460VAC 3-phase power with Milspec Class-L connectors. <br> * The system shall make 3,600 lbs. per day of potable ice in 10 Lb. sealed bags. Ice quality standards for potability are validated through the use of TB MED 577 and MIL-STD-3006. <br> * The system shall be able to store a minimum of 1,200 Lbs. (120 bags) of ice.  <br> * All FPE systems should demonstrate a Mean Time Between Essential Functional Failure of at least 300 hours. <br> * No specific MOS will be required to operate the system. PMCS expected to be performed by 92G or 92A. Maintenance expected to be performed by 91C (utilities Equipment Repairer) and 91J (quartermaster and chemical equipment repairer). <br> * The only soldier interaction required should be limited to repositioning stored ice or replenishing the bag supply. The system shall not require any soldier interaction for a minimum of 2 hours. In general, operation should be trouble free (i.e., no bag jams, resets, or other nuisance trips). <br> * Shall demonstrate compliance with UL, FDA and NSF regulations and guidance for this type of equipment including cleaning and maintenance (PMCS). <br> *Shall be durable enough to withstand transport by air, sea, rail, and ground. Shall remain functional after being subjected to rail impact testing and extensive military road shock testing. <br> * The CIMS shall withstand storage in the temperature range of Basic Cold (-28oF/-33oC) to Hot Dry (160oF/71oC) per AR 70-38 without loss of full capability (plastic bags excluded). <br> * The system shall demonstrate its ability to meet the 24 hour capacity requirements under conditions described in AR 70-38 for 'Hot' (including 'dry' and 'humid' sub sections) and 'Basic' environments. The system is not expected to operate at temperatures lower than 40oF. <br> * The system shall demonstrate its ability to meet 24 hour capacity requirements with high input water temperatures that can range from 40 F-110 F during the hottest parts of the day. <br> * The system shall be able to produce and store potable ice in the windy and sandy conditions as described in AR 70-38 Section II. <br> * Able to be erected on semi-prepared surfaces (cleared and basically level). Ice System may be placed on foot pads, concrete blocks, footers, beams/rails, head wall or its pedestals. <br> * External surfaces will be corrosion resistant and be capable of being cleaned by the user. <br> * A blackout option is required. <br>  <br> Information of interest: <br> PMFSS appreciates vendor's interest in this notice.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for potential offerors or bidders to support the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation located at Grand Coulee, Washington. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and DOES NOT serve to bind the U.S. Government in any way. Interested parties shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with preparation of their responses.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Pacific Northwest Regional Office is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to identify potential firms who are certified Small Business prime construction contractors. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on Federal Business opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project will be a Firm-Fixed Price construction contract. The principal components of the work to be performed under these specifications include preparing logs to be used in a log boom, preforming/obtaining a geotechnical investigation at each anchor site to verify the selection of anchor model, installing anchors upon the shore to hold the log boom in place, providing and installing steel buoys, placing concrete blocks to be used as intermediate anchors at each buoy location, mounting USCG approved lights on the buoys, and installing the log boom system. Due to the lack of access to project sites by land and restrictions on soil disturbances, the work is expected to be completed from a barge. 
Work is located at two separate locations on Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake; Moonbeam Bay and Redford Canyon in Ferry County, Washington. Moonbeam Bay is located approximately 15 river miles upstream of Grand Coulee, Washington and Redford Canyon is located approximately 24 river miles upstream of Grand Coulee, Washington. 
The purpose of the barrier systems is to reduce disturbance to sensitive resources caused by wave action and recreational visitors. A waterway barrier will also restrict boat traffic and deter on-shore activities. Installing a restrictive waterway barrier aims to protect the shorelines in these two areas from further degradation.

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>A. Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), overall mission is to develop and implement technology for the rapid isolation, analysis, and treatment of genetic diseases. The Division's research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to study the fundamental mechanisms of inherited and acquired genetic disorders. Research also includes planning and conducting clinical trials to test DNA-based methods for treatment and perhaps the cure of such diseases. Researchers collect and study families in which important diseases are inherited as well as, translate basic science advances into effective, reliable, and cost effective DNA and cytogenetic-based diagnostics.</p>
<p>This initial Clinical Study has been undergoing since April 1998. As part of a continued collaborative effort under revised protocol OH97-HG-N035, last approved by the NHGRI Institutional Review Board on May 23, 2013, individuals from multiplex families determined to have hereditary oral clefts will continue to be studied. Data will be collected in the IBN Al-Nafees Hospital in Damascus, Syria as well as biological specimens from individuals who are members of families determined to have multiple family members affected with hereditary oral clefts. If possible, the Contractor shall collect biological specimens from unaffected Syrian individuals with no family history of oral clefts. Translation services will continue to be provided for this study. The data collection has been very successful in the past but additional families are needed to increase the power of the study and to ensure detection of all important genetic effects and the Contractor shall re-contact members of previously enrolled families as needed by the NIH investigators.</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the NIH researchers dedicated to the study. Since the beginning of this study in April 1998, it has been determined by the principal investigator, that two tasks are required for the successful conduct of this study of hereditary oral clefts in the Syrian Arab Republic. Dr. Hasan lbacha-Hejazi, will service as the head clinical investigator in the Syrian Arab Republic and this requirement.</p>
<p>The objective of the study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of genes involved in causing inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease. The families available for study in the Syrian Arab Republic are unique in that the family size is large, the generation time is short, and there are many families with multiple individuals affected with non-syndromic oral clefts. Such families are extremely rare in the United States and the families enrolled in this study allow NIH researchers to perform powerful studies that may help to identify genetic risk factors for oral clefts that will then be applicable to individuals in the U.S.</p>
<p>Task 1: The Contractor shall provide data collection services in conjunction with Dr. Hasan Albacha-Hejazi, an M.D. with a private clinic and Hospital privileges in the Syrian Arab Republic.</p>
<p>Task 2: The Contractor in conjunction with Dr. Hasan lbacha-Hejazi, the head clinical investigator in the Syrian Arab Republic shall provide a translator, which is necessary for the Contractors to perform various tasks involving translation of material from English to Arabic and vice versa.</p>
<p>For Task 1: these services will be in the following areas: determination of eligibility, patient and control registration, clinical evaluation of family members, biological sample collection and shipment, re-contact of previously studied family members as needed by the NIH scientists to update information or consents and to explain clinically relevant results if needed.</p>
<p>For Task 2: these services will be in the following areas: word processing, informed consent forms, protocol documentation and amendment, study newsletter, conference calls, study and contract administrative documents, email and written communications with Syrian clinicians, etc. The NIH does not offer translation in Arabic for this wide array of services.</p>

Such families are extremely rare in the United States and the families enrolled in this study allow NIH researchers to perform powerful studies that may help to identify genetic risk factors for oral clefts that will then be applicable to individuals in the U.S.</p>
<p>C. Contractor's Requirements:</p>
<p>Task 1: The contractor shall engage in several activities, including: (1) determination of eligibility for patients and controls, (2) patient and control registration, (3) clinical evaluation of family members, (4) biological sample collection and shipment, and (5) recontact and update the status of previously studied family members as needed by the NIH scientists for updating information, obtaining additional informed consent, obtaining additional biological samples and communicating results to families when approved by both the NIH and Syrian ethics oversight committees.</p>
<p>Task 2: The contractor shall engage in several translation activities (some of which require the ability to utilize a word processing/software package such as WordPerfect for Arabic): (1) Translation of all study documents into Arabic. Any new changes to the study protocol, clinical questionnaires or consent forms required by the NHGRI IRB will be translated as well as any other documents required by the NIH; (2) Translation services for phone calls and emails between the Contractor and the Principal Investigator, (3) Translation services to clarify questions and problems between Principal Investigator and the site investigators, (4) Translate other documents for the study such as letters to Syrian officials when deemed necessary, the study newsletter for participants, study and contract administrative documents and other documents as needed, and (5) Perform other translation services as needed.</p>
<p>D. Reporting Requirement and Deliverables:</p>
<p>The contractor shall work with the research team and other members of the NHGRI on an as needed basis. They will communicate progress and provide summary of activities, either orally and in writing, to the NIH Principal Investigator quarterly. These reports may be brief summary emails. In addition to these progress reports, the contractor shall 1) translate any documents as needed and provide translation services when communication is needed between the Principal Investigator and the Contractor or other investigators, 2) deliver the pedigree data and biological specimens as collection of each family is completed, and 3) re-contact previously enrolled families as needed by the NIH investigators. The contractors will meet the principal investigator at a scientific meeting or participate in teleconferences as needed for planning and development of the data collection efforts.</p>
<p>E. Program Management and Control Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall work independently with no direct supervision by any government employee. The study Principal Investigator and other research team members will provide guidance in terms of technical reporting needs and study requirements of the project supported.</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) availability of competition; (2) the capability of qualified small business concerns; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p>BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is one of the 27 Institutes and Centers composing the National Institutes of Health. The NIEHS is home to the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) interagency program dedicated to testing and evaluating substances in our environment. The program was created as a cooperative effort to coordinate toxicology testing programs within the federal government; strengthen the science base in toxicology; strengthen the science base in toxicology; develop and validate improved testing methods; and provide information about potentially toxic chemicals. The audiences for these efforts are the health, regulatory, and research agencies, scientific and medical communities, and the public.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The Neural Circuits Group of the Neurobiology Laboratory at the NIEHS will be conducting numerous studies in which a 2-photon microscope is required to visualize the activity and morphology of fluorescently labeled neurons in vivo. In addition to imaging, the use of micromanipulators will be required for the fine scale movement of electrodes while imaging.</p>
<p>&bull; The Neural Circuits Group has several upcoming needs:<br />o Imaging cohorts of neurons in the intact mouse brain that are labeled by up to four fluorophores/dyes.<br />o Photo-activating neurons expressing channelrhodopsin2 in vivo.<br />o Determining the physiological response of neurons in vivo and in vitro using calcium imaging and recording electrodes.<br />&bull; The Microscope must be capable of performing the following: <br />o Imaging 4 fluorophores is essential. Imaging sessions will often be set to run overnight and lab personnel is unavailable overnight to change filters if a scope with less than 4 PMT's is procured.<br />o Rapidly turning off the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) during optogenetic stimulation to prevent saturation of the PMTs during scanning is necessary for photo-stimulation studies. A saturated PMT needs to be turned off and reset and is not permissible within the time scale of the studies.<br />o Rapidly acquiring frames to allow calcium imaging is essential to capturing the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli. Neurological events occur on the sub-second scale. Slower acquisition times would reduce the group's ability to detect these events.<br />o Moving the angle and xyz axes of the objective is another necessary feature. Moving the specimen is not an option for the studies because the specimen will have recording electrodes delicately implanted in its brain.<br />o Perform multiple whole cell recordings at once (i.e., two (2) micromanipulators allow for only two (2) connections between neurons at the same time, while four (4) manipulators allows for testing twelve (12) connections at the same time. In order to fit more manipulators around the sample at once, the microphones must be both narrow and extremely stable.</p>
<p>See Attachment 1 - Microscope Specifications for details.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED DELIVERY DATE: It is expected that delivery will be approximately three (3) months after receipt of order.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE: The intended procurement will be classified under the NAICS code 334516; Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE: The anticipated contract type will be a firm-fixed price contract type.</p>
<p>DELIVERY LOCATION: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Building 101, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) availability of competition; (2) the capability of qualified small business concerns; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p>BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is one of the 27 Institutes and Centers composing the National Institutes of Health. The NIEHS is home to the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) interagency program dedicated to testing and evaluating substances in our environment. The program was created as a cooperative effort to coordinate toxicology testing programs within the federal government; strengthen the science base in toxicology; strengthen the science base in toxicology; develop and validate improved testing methods; and provide information about potentially toxic chemicals. The audiences for these efforts are the health, regulatory, and research agencies, scientific and medical communities, and the public.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The Intramural Research Division (IRD) has a requirement for the performance of Ribonucleic acid (RNA) NextGen sequencing services on 450 samples. The required services are in order to allow for the completion of ongoing research projects within the Epigenomics Core Laboratory (ECL) of the Epigenetic and Stem Cell Biology Lab. The Contractor shall provide sequencing support for making libraries and shall provide the data in both fastq and in cel file format. The Contractor shall provide NextGen sequencing that includes high quality NextGen library construction with proper QC confirmation. The Contractor shall provide NextGen RNA sequencing runs/lanes of high quality constructed libraries with accompanying bioinformatics support. Due to the high dimensionality of sequencing data, identifying these differences using traditional methods such a t-test can be difficult as traditionally stringent statistical cutoffs still can yield significant false positives. The lab is currently using DNA sequencing analysis data to mitigate the multiple testing issues by calculating a false discovery rate from a reference data distribution generated from experimental data. The Contractor must be able to maintain continuity of research and accurately determine the error rate and provide the best data possible to researchers of DIR.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is 12 Months.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE: The intended procurement will be classified under the NAICS code 541380, "Testing Laboratories" with a size standard of $15.0M.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE: The anticipated contract type will be a firm-fixed price contract type.</p>
<p>DELIVERY LOCATION: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Building 101, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709</p>

<DESC>Retro-commissioning Sensor Suitcase: A Call for Deployment Partners
<p>With support from the U.S. Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a technology, the Retro-Commissioning (RCx) Sensor Suitcase, that provides a hardware and software solution that non-experts can use to generate low- or no-cost recommendations automatically on how to improve a building's operating costs, comfort, and energy performance. The DOE Team is now looking to identify Deployment Partners who can help bring the technology to market.</p>
<p>The Retro-commissioning (RCx) Sensor Suitcase embeds the knowledge and skills of a highly experienced building commissioning practitioner into a scalable hardware and software package that can be easily deployed by a variety of building services personnel to make it easier and more cost-effective for small building owners and operators to reap the benefits and cost savings of building commissioning. It therefore offers the potential to provide energy services to a traditionally hard-to-reach market, that of small commercial buildings. In January of this year, ESource identified the Sensor Suitcase as one of their "Top 22 Technologies and Trends of 2014."</p>

<a href="mailto:kevin.s.anderson2@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Fort Worth</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project: <br>   <br> Construct Oxbow Valley Storage Sites A&C, Fort Worth, Texas, Central City Project <br>  <br> Project Description includes site preparation, earthwork, excavation, installation of prefabricated maintenance bridge, construction of creek (to include excavation for new creek alignment, aquatic features, riffle pools and runs, and retaining walls), construction of weir, construction of water surface regulator, construction of wet well, site restoration and maintenance, and relocation/removal/construction of a new access road. <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are: <br> a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b.) The complexity of the project. <br> c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects. <br> f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br> g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>       <br>     (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br>  <br>     (2) Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to kevin.s.anderson2@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on May 19, 2015.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information requested herein. <br>  <br> Description of requirement: <br>  <br> This Performance Work Statement (PWS) summary provides a description of the inspection, testing, maintenance and repair services for all of the emergency generators at the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC). The Contractor shall furnish all management, quality control, labor, supervision, parts, materials, tools, equipment, supplies, and transportation to perform the inspection, testing, maintenance and repair services of all of the emergency generators at the ERDC to insure that the equipment is functioning efficiently with minimum disruption in performance and in accordance with the PWS.  Currently, there are 33 generators located at ERDC.     <br>  <br> The specific tasks and duties required for this requirement are outlined below.  These tasks required may be subject to change and may change upon issuance of a solicitation.  <br>  <br> The contractor shall provide all management, quality control, labor, supervision, parts, materials, tools, equipment, supplies, and transportation to perform in accordance with this performance work statement unless otherwise specified herein. <br>  <br> The Equipment Inventory will be provided to the contractor in an electronic format (Microsoft Access) after contract award. Any discrepancies or omissions in the Equipment Inventory do not relieve the contractor from the obligation to maintain those systems that are physically present and operational at contract award.  At contract termination, or at any time requested, the Contractor shall provide the Equipment Inventory in electronic format (Microsoft Access) to the COR within 5 working days. <br>  <br> During the 5 year period of performance of this contract the government may add or remove generators and associated equipment to/from the Equipment Inventory that the contractor is responsible for maintaining.  Additions may be due to the construction or acquisition of new buildings, facilities or equipment; removals may be due to the replacement or obsolescence of existing buildings, facilities or equipment.  In the case of adding equipment, the Contractor may request an equitable adjustment to incorporate the new equipment into the Contractor's preventative maintenance service.  Likewise, an equitable adjustment shall be due the government for equipment that no longer requires maintenance due to obsolescence or other reasons. <br>  <br> The contractor services shall include: routine and scheduled maintenance; inspection; repair; installation; modification or adjustment as required for the systems to operate and perform as intended and/or specified herein. <br>  <br> The preventative maintenance services are those that shall be done on a scheduled basis to keep the generator systems operating and functioning efficiently, minimize breakdowns, avoid costly repairs and extend the service life through periodic inspection, adjustment, lubrication, parts replacement and cleaning.  All preventative maintenance on generator equipment shall be performed at a frequency and in accordance with industry standards and manufacturer's recommendations at a minimum. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall prepare and keep current a preventative maintenance schedule.  The schedule shall include the same equipment and building identification that is used in the Equipment Inventory. <br>  <br> All Preventative Maintenance costs shall be included in the Monthly Preventative Maintenance Contract Line Item.  No additional costs shall be charged to the government for preventative maintenance including parts, labor, equipment, materials, transportation, tools or supervision.

PURPOSE:
This Sources Sought Notice from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to determine marketplace capability to perform Legionella Water Testing Services solely for information and planning purposes.  Services are listed in Appendix A, "Table of RFI Questions".  Responses to this Sources Sought Notice may be used to support future development of VA Legionella Water Testing programs focused on meeting the requirements of VHA Directive 1061, "Prevention of Healthcare-Associated Legionella Disease and Scald Injury From Potable Water Distribution Systems."

Intellectual, confidential, or other privileged or proprietary information contained in responses to this RFI will not be distributed outside of the VA. 

In the event a VA program is developed in response to this Sources Sought Notice and a solicitation is issued, no intellectual, confidential, or other proprietary information received in response will be divulged. 
BACKGROUND: 
In accordance with VHA Directive 1061, VA Medical Centers must collect water samples on at least a quarterly basis and test for Legionella.  Laboratory analysis must be conducted by an Environmental Legionella Isolation Techniques Evaluation (ELITE) certified laboratory or a laboratory certified in the Public Health England (PHE) Legionella External Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme as proficient at performing the culture of Legionella form environmental samples, and with experience in microbial testing of potable water, including specific serotyping.  Environmental samples will primarily be from potable hot and cold water supply plumbing fixtures.
In accordance to VHA Directive 1061, water samples for Legionella testing must be collected from at least 10 outlets on the hot water distribution system and at least 10 outlets on the cold water distribution system for at least each VHA medical center building that falls under the purview of the Directive.  Samples must be tested from each building on at least a quarterly frequency.  Sample quantity may vary and sample quantity is not guaranteed by the Government.  Additional samples may also be collected at the discretion of individual Medical Centers. 
DESCRIPTION: 
VA is interested in identifying sources and seeking information from industry regarding its ability to provide Legionella Water Testing and Ancillary Services for the VA.  VA estimates that microbial laboratory testing up to 250,000 environmental Legionella samples will be performed annually.  Samples will be collected from up to 152 Medical Centers throughout the United States and its territories.  VA anticipates that work will be performed without Government supervision, oversight, or other means of intervention.    

 "Sampling" means the taking of water samples by Contractor personnel for the purpose of testing or analysis; "collection" means the pick-up or transport of these samples for shipment and delivery to a different location for testing or analysis.  As this Sources Sought Notice is seeking information regarding standard commercial practices, responses should state whether these definitions meet their current practices.
REQUESTED INFORMATION: 
Responses are welcome from all capable sources.  Interested parties shall complete the attached spreadsheet in response to this Sources Sought Notice, and are encouraged to include any additional information regarding current standard commercial practices. 
SUBMISSION: 
This announcement contains all information required to submit a response.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.
DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES: 
This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotes (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB), or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever.  The VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited costs incurred in response to this Request for Information; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP/RFQ, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will NOT be returned. 

Questions regarding this notice are welcomed.  Questions should be forwarded to Antonio Stewart, Contracting Officer at antonio.stewart@va.gov or Stephanie Bellanger at stephanie.bellanger@va.gov.

1.	BACKGROUND:  

As a response to the August 27, 2004 President Bush signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the VA Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Program and began issuing PIV cards at the VA Central Office (VACO) in October 2006. The HSPD-12 Presidential Directive requires executive branch agencies to adhere to common technical standards and business processes to improve the security posture within individual agencies and departments while increasing the protection of identity information more broadly across the Federal Government. 

In March 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) designated the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness (OSP) as the overall VA Business Sponsor to provide policy, guidance, and oversight for the HSPD-12 Program. VA then established a Program Management Office (PMO) in October 2009. 

Growth in the number of facilities supporting veteran activities and the expanding number of personnel supporting the agency's business operations has led to the requirement for enterprise-wide vehicle to acquire additional fingerprint scanning assets to expedite personnel related efforts.

<RESPDATE>051115
<CONTACT>Kelli R. Vaughn, Phone 9375224575, Email kelli.vaughn@us.af.mil
<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Teleradiology Services. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 621111 - Office of Physicians (Except Mental Health Specialists). Business size standard is for NAICS 621111 is $11M.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Valor Network Inc., 7 Hemptor Road, New City, NY 10956. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 9:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, 11 May 2015. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: Valor Network Inc. currently has the unique capability of USAF authorization to electronically extract radiologic diagnostic imaging studies, the physician staff to interpret and report on the radiologic diagnostic imaging studies/exams and lastly the ability to place the patient reports into the DoD Composite Healthcare Computer System (CHCS) in each patient record in the same manner the Wright-Patterson radiologists would so that the ordering physician gets the results; maintaining continuity of care and patient reporting. Valor Network Inc. is the only vendor granted access by the Air Force Surgeon General's Office to the USAF electronic patient medical record system (CHCS) with Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) approval with the USAF. In order to reliably provide services to produce routine and urgent reports within required timeframe, remote connectivity must be established. Without approval and access to CHCS and DIACAP, the vendor will not be able to remotely connect to interpret and report on the patient's medical records. No other vendors have received USAF permission by the Air Force Surgeon General to electronically interface with CHCS and DIACAP for the purpose of interpreting and reporting on radiologic diagnostic images/exams. The Air Force Surgeon General's Office estimated that obtaining the appropriate CHCS and DIACAP authorizations required to perform this contract could take (at the very least) 12-24 months.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Kelli.Vaughn@us.af.mil no later than 9:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, 11 May 2015. Only inquiries/ information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-A-0016, Teleradiology Services." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), intends to contract with Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 2171 Monroe Avenue, Suite 203, Rochester, NY 14618, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for internet-based research paper series membership. SSRN has been identified as the only source capable of providing the required content in an arrangement that meets the needs of the OFR.
<p>The Full RPS membership package can provide a branded e-journal for OFR by creating an email abstracting journal specifically for OFR and delivering it free to subscribers on SSRN; this will increase OFR's exposure significantly. Additionally, the e-journal series will place OFR's research in a highlighted position in the Economic Research Network, where 346,806 economics papers are currently hosted. Further, the OFR Research Paper Series will be listed in the Government &amp; Public Agency Research Paper Series, where 26,721 Papers are currently hosted. OFR will appear alongside other economic research institutions that also have an e-journal series, such as the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and 8 regional Federal Reserve Banks, and many central banks from around the world. The scale of SSRN makes it the premier destination for economics research to be hosted. The RPS membership also creates a customized Home Page highlighting OFR's logo and design. On the home page, SSRN will aggregate the research and provide links back to OFR's public website. The home page is accessible via the SSRN browse by Journal list and the Research Paper Series page. SSRN provides Interdisciplinary distribution for each submitted paper in up to 12 of their 1000+ subject matter journals across multiple networks. This can distribute the paper to between 5,000-10,000 recipients; therefore significantly increasing OFR exposure. The SSRN Full RPS membership provides the capability to track readership of published material. Additionally, SSRN provides dedicated staff to expand readership of the research papers and provide reference information for OFR with a link to OFR's public website in a pop-up window. Finally, SSRN provides performance information on downloads and citations by organization and author, which will allow OFR management to analyze performance outcomes associated with the usage of various research products.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than May 14, 2014 at 2:00 pm EST. Responses must be submitted electronically to Purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: SG/MF. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested data. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to SSRN.</p>

<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.).

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY:  NEEDS MORE INFO ON THIS APPLICATION FIELD Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center, Jefferson Laboratory, and the National Institute of Aerospace have jointly developed a new method for manufacturing boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) which can be used to create piezoelectric devices that can be used for energy harvesting applications. BNNTs are a direct analog of carbon nanotubes, with superior properties for many applications. They are as strong as carbon nanotubes (within a few percentage points) and are good thermal conductors. However, they have a much higher service temperature, are highly electroactive, shield neutron radiation, have a more active surface chemistry, are non-cytotoxic (in tests on human cells), and are naturally white (can be dyed). BNNTs produced by this method have far superior morphology than those previously available. The new tubes have a nearly perfect crystalline structure with one wall to just a few, and are extremely long. Because of the length of the tubes and the white color, the raw material produced by the new method has the physical appearance of cotton. The new synthesis method, called the pressurized vapor/condenser (PVC) technique, is described in Very long single- and few-walled boron nitride nanotubes via the pressurized vapor/condenser method (M. W. Smith et al., Nanotechnology, 20, 505604, 2009). The technique involves high-power laser heating of a boron-containing target under high-pressure nitrogen. A proof-of-concept pilot facility has been constructed to demonstrate the method. Typical rates for the synthesis of raw material are between 20 and 100 mg/hour. The purity of the raw material is estimated to be between 25% and 40% by mass, the primary contaminants being particles of boron nitride and boron. No catalysts are used in the synthesis process. The only reactants are boron and nitrogen, which are both nontoxic. The long BNNTs in PVC-grown raw material can be spun directly into yarns or threads, although mechanically strong yarns will require purification prior to processing. U.S. patents 8,206,674 and 8,753,578. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<SUBJECT>Intent to award sole source contract to MCI Communications Service Inc. 
<SOLNBR>PR1300489535A
<ARCHDATE>05132015
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:doug.shadd@navy.mil">doug.shadd@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Synopsis: 
NAVSUP FLC Code 215.4, Mechanicsburg on behalf of NAVSUP Business Systems Center (BSC) intends to award a Sole source Firm fixed Price contract to MCI Communications Services Inc., for a continuation of International communications line from PA to Saudi Arabia // Current Contract N0018914PQ109  New Procurement # PR1300 489535  estimated value $98,628.72    

The COMPASS Communications Line is NAVSUP BSCs direct link from Mechanicsburg, PA to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  The Communications Line allows NAVSUP BSC to provide critical support to our customer, the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF).  NAVSUP BSC uses the line to develop, maintain, and provide production support for the RSNF COMPASS supply system.
  COMPASS provides logistics support for the entire RSNF.    Period of performance required is 6/1/15 to 5/31/16 Total cost estimate is $98,628.72.

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), this authority is appropriate when, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.
Identification of the justification rationale:  The justification for limiting sources is only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.
  No other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Additionally Verizon / MCI Communications Services Inc. is the required vendor because NAVSUP BSCs customer, the Royal Saudi Naval Forces, chooses this vendor to use for their portion of the communications service. NAVSUP BSC funds half of the total requirement and the RSNF funds half of the total requirement.  Each activity coordinates a contract for their portion. Therefore FAR 5.202(a)(3) applies.  NAVSUP BSC funds the private communications service line in Mechanicsburg PA to Saudi Arabia, and the RSNF funds the communications service line from Saudi Arabia back to Mechanicsburg PA.  Both portions of this requirement must be with the same vendor to ensure compatibility, and minimize problems and inconsistencies.
 

The NAICS code that applies to this acquisition is 517110 Wired Telecommunications  and  Transmission Service, 1500 employees.     This announcement in no way requests any form of proposal or quote. Please refer all responses, comments and questions to the Contract Specialist at email address: doug.shadd@navy.mil  no later than 12 noon EST, May 11, 2015

Detailed Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition attached

NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:mills.noelle@epa.gov">POC Email Address</a>
<DESC>This notice was initially posted on Friday, May 1, 2015, under the heading J&A.
The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of the FAR 6.302-1 with Cadmus, Inc. to provide support services to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) under contract titled ?Implementation of the Public Water Systems Supervision (PWSS) And Underground Injection Control (UIC) Programs?, EP-C-08-015, for an additional 6,100 level of effort labor hours to be utilized to extend the contract which expires June 30, 2015, by two months, until August 31, 2015.
The purpose of this requirement is to provide technical support for implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  The Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water (OW) establish national drinking water standards for public water systems to assure water supplied to the public is safe to drink.  These standards are implemented through the Public Water Systems Supervision (PWSS) program.  The SDWA also requires EPA to establish and implement regulations for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program to safeguard underground sources of drinking water.  The Act envisions a joint Federal/State program to assure compliance with these standards.  Congress intends that the States take a leading role in the primary enforcement responsibility (primacy) for both programs.  EPA requires contract support to assist its efforts in developing and implementing regulations and carrying out other SDWA implementation activities .
EPA believes that The Cadmus Group, with its experience in working the current contract, is uniquely qualified for this short term additional effort and The Cadmus Group is the only responsible source able to perform this 2-month effort due to its combination of expertise, knowledge of the equipment and facilities, and familiarity with ongoing projects required to meet EPA?s critical deadlines.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The anticipated award date for this modification to the existing contract is June 16, 2015.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Nerve Block Trays. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Nerve Block Tray products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Nerve Block Trays. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.</p>
<p>The QSL for Nerve Block Trays will be established approximately October 2015 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately November 2015 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Nerve Block Trays. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Nerve Block Trays.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Nerve Block Trays. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $303,733. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Six items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 72.55%% ($220,381) of the total volume in sales ($303,733). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, and Number of eaches in Unit of Sale.

As used in this clause? (1) ?Contract financing payment? and ?invoice payment? have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (2) ?Electronic form? means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests. However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.

(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (4) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <BR> <BR>(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <BR> <BR>(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

(q) Other compliances. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract. <BR> <BR>(r) Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts. The Contractor agrees to comply with 31 U.S.C. 1352 relating to limitations on the use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. chapter 37, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards; 41 U.S.C. chapter 87, Kickbacks; 41 U.S.C. 4712 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to whistleblower protections; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. chapter 21 relating to procurement integrity. (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) The schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) The clause at 52.212-5; (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) Other paragraphs of this clause; (7) The Standard Form 1449; (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) The specification. <BR> <BR>(t) System for Award Management (SAM) (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<p>Requirement:<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), requires a Cardio Monitoring System, and multiple one-year post-warranty Preventive Maintenance Service Agreements.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Numerous drugs have the potential adverse effect of prolonging the QT interval, a marker for torsade de pointes (TdP), which can cause the heart to stop beating. The current FDA guidelines are very useful for identifying QT prolonging drugs, but some QT "positive" drugs have no demonstrable clinical risks of TdP. Researchers are aiming to establish an appropriate, strong pre-clinical proarrhythmia screening model that can directly measure and rank TdP risk and the influence of sex hormones. A system that monitor cells in real-time without the potential artifacts generated through the use of labels is needed to accommodate this study. Researchers require a non-invasive measurement method that allows detection of changes in adherence, morphology and viability without the need for over-expression of reporter and target proteins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minimum Technical Specifications:<br />&bull; Shall be able to measure the electrical function in native cell types <br />&bull; Monitor the action potential duration and beat period of the cardiomyocytes cultured in 3 formats in non-invasive assay:<br />o 12-well<br />o 48-well<br />o 96-well<br />&bull; High-throughput screening for cellular electrophysiology using more than 750 simultaneously-recorded electrodes. <br />&bull; Label-free, non-invasive measurement technology that avoids influences on cellular health and function. <br />&bull; Interchangeable use of all plate types 12, 48, and 96-well, with at least 8 electrodes/well.<br />&bull; Fully-integrated heater, adjustable in software between ambient temperature and 45&deg;C <br />&bull; Adapter for control of gas environment outside of incubator.<br />&bull; External computer and software capable of control and assess:<br />o No less than Windows 7 Professional Operating System<br />o Visual Activity Map for real-time plate-wide feedback on action potential activity<br />o Integrated control of plate temperature and electrical stimulation<br />o Automatic search of full beat period for cardiac T-wave<br />o Automatic calculation of beat-by-beat measurements and electrode and well averages for field.<br />o Potential duration, beat period, and depolarization spike amplitude and slope<br />&bull; Inside delivery with on-site installation and training.</p>
<p><br />Minimum Post-Warranty Preventative Maintenance<br />The Government requires post-warranty Preventative Maintenance services as detailed below for four (4) years via multiple option periods that the Government may exercise on a unilateral basis. <br />&bull; At least one on-site Preventive Maintenance (PM) visit per year<br />&bull; Shall include unlimited technical support (e.g., telephone-based, email-based, website-based, etc.), Mondays - Fridays (excluding Federal Holidays) between the hours of 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM Central Time. <br />&bull; Shall include unlimited software and firmware updates<br />&bull; All Preventive Maintenance shall be performed on-site by formally trained and certified technicians/engineers, following Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications, manuals, and service bulletins, using OEM replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.<br />&bull; All Preventive Maintenance pricing shall be inclusive of labor, travel, replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.<br />&bull; Service Records and Reports:<br />The Contractor shall, commensurate with the completion of each preventative maintenance visit, provide the end-user of the equipment and the Contracting Officer with a copy of a field service report/ticket identifying the equipment name, manufacturer, model number, and serial number of the equipment being serviced and provide detailed description of the work performed, the test instruments or other equipment used to affect or otherwise perform the service, the name(s) and contact information of the technician who performed the repair/service, and for information purposes, the on-site hours expended and parts/components replaced.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to reduce fuels, release conifers from brush competition,<br />and to prepare sites for tree planting within the Aspen wildfire area and on the Soaproot project, by mechanically clearing and piling slash, vegetation, and other debris. Prior to this treatment the areas within the Aspen fire will have been harvested, removing the dead and dying material of commercial size. In addition, if needed, small trees will be thinned, if alive, or just felled if all dead. Within the Soaproot project most units have also been harvested (a thinning prescription) and where necessary the pre-commercial sized trees thinned. The result will be trees remaining on the site that are spaced out (the spacing is variable but roughly between 16 and 20 feet). It will be necessary to work around these crop trees. Also there are several units in the soaproot project that are brush fields. Work on this project shall be done in a manner that does not damage residual trees or vegetation not specified to be treated. Work is to be performed on the High Sierra Ranger District.

<p>6. Description of Services: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. For more information on the MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.</p>
<p>The Governments of the Kingdom of Morocco and the United States are in the process of preparing the basis for an agreement for MCC grant funding to implement a development program. The program will be implemented through a five (5) year agreement ("Compact"), whose goal is to reduce poverty through economic growth. The Government of Morocco has submitted concept papers focused on improving education quality (secondary and professional training), commercial justice, and land management. All of the projects under consideration support the necessary shift in Morocco from static, state-led systems to supporting a competitive enabling environment that can respond to dynamic private sector demand. MCC has narrowed the focus to concentrate on education quality and land management.</p>
<p>7. Scope: MCC is seeking an experienced Infrastructure and Management Expert with particular expertise in building condition assessments, site planning and project development, to assist in due diligence of project concepts related to infrastructure elements of the proposed projects. This will include home office reviews and field assessments of sample sites, drafting terms of reference for additional studies and providing inputs to the development of documentation leading to an Investment Memo, which would be the basis for a compact between MCC and the Kingdom of Morocco. Should these efforts result in a signed compact, the consultant may be requested to assist MCC in overseeing implementation activities.</p>
<p>8. This combined synopsis and solicitation notice is a request for competitive quotations. Therefore, all quotations received prior to the RFQ close date will be considered.</p>
<p>9. The Government will award an order to the responsible independent consultant(s) whose quote conforming to this notice represents the best value in terms of technical criteria, past performance and price. All non-price factors (technical criteria and past performance) are more important than price. If options are included, quotes will be evaluated by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>
<p>10. Evaluation Factors: Only quotes which meet the required technical evaluation criteria will be considered. <br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>&bull; Degree in Architecture or Civil Engineering (MANDATORY).</p>
<p>&bull; At least 15 years of experience in the planning and development of infrastructure projects, with particular expertise in needs assessments and implementation (MANDATORY).</p>
<p>&bull; Written and spoken native fluency in French and working knowledge of English (MANDATORY).</p>

<p>MCC reserves the right to interview the candidates.</p>

The Consultant will be requested to mobilize on a short notice and will be expected to deliver high quality finished products in a timely manner. <br /><br />PAST PERFORMANCE<br />Three (3) professional references for relevant work performed during the past three years.</p>
<p>PRICE<br />The Government will examine the proposed rate for reasonableness.</p>
<p>11. Exclusion of Quotes and Communications: At any time prior to award, including upon receipt of quotes, the Government may exclude a quote from further consideration for reasons such as (but not limited to): non-compliance with instructions related to this solicitation; the quote is not among the most highly rated; or the quote is not likely to be selected for award. The Government need not notify an offeror that its quote has been excluded from further consideration nor need it provide the offeror with a pre-award debriefing. However, the offeror will be provided post-award notification and if requested, a brief explanation of the basis of the award decision.</p>
<p>After receipt of quotes, the Government will conduct an evaluation. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract/ order without communications with offerors. However, during the evaluation process, the Government may, solely at its discretion, communicate with an offeror for any purpose, such as to gain a better understanding of the quote. As a result of such communication, the Government may allow offerors to submit quote revisions. If quote revisions are allowed, the Government may, solely at its discretion, impose non-common due dates for the revisions. In other words, the Government may elect to have a quote revision date for an offeror that is different than the quote revision date for another offeror(s). The Government need not conduct communications with all offerors. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, conduct communications with one or only some offerors. Furthermore, the Government need not permit all offerors to submit quote revisions. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, seek quote revisions from only one or only some offerors.</p>
<p>12. Evaluation Methodology: The Government will perform a comparative analysis of quotes and will assess the advantages and disadvantages of each quote as related to the Evaluation Factors. Multiple awards may be made from this notice and all quotes will be retained and may be utilized for requirements for a period of 6 months.</p>
<p>13. Quote Deadline: Independent Consultants are invited to submit their quotations in response to this notice by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), May 21, 2015.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-RFQ-15-321 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541711 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p><strong>SET-ASIDE STATUS<br /></strong>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses.</p>
<p><strong> ACQUISITION AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-81, dated April 10, 2015. The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information<br /></span>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways.  First, our quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) paradigm, which tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen, is unique.  However, more and more academic and pharmaceutical groups are now adopting it in their own operations due to the enhanced data generation that enable compound bioactivity assessment and probe production efficiency.  This efficiency derives not only from savings in post-screen cherry-picking, reconfirmation, dose-response testing, and initial SAR assessment, but also from the ability to perform reliable "virtual counter screens," thus allowing us to make more informed decisions on which scaffolds to pursue for probe development.  Second, the NCATS is distinctive in its focus on collaboration with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define new biology.  This focus is reflected in our unprecedented Outreach program, which reaches hundreds of potential new investigators every year, and accounts for much of the new science being done at the NCATS.  Third, the NCATS is uniquely focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of probe development, typified by qHTS, our informatics platform, our utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose<br /></span>NCATS requires the creation and curation of a database to support some of NCATS projects, such as NPC, Inxight, NPACT, and Pharos.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.246-70 PLACE OF ACCEPTANCE (APR 2010)<br />(a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract.<br />(b) The place of acceptance will be:<br />National Weather Service (WFO Utah) <br />2242 W North Temple<br />Salt Lake City, UT 84116.</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED - NWWT9932-15-00994<br />HELIUM DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL<br />FOR WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE SALT LAKE CITY, UTAHS</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Salt Lake City, UT launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 3am and 3pm MST (4am and 4pm MDT). Each balloon requires approximately 85 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium (between 510 CF and 1,700 CF per week) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS office located at 2242 W North Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84116. The total amount of helium to be delivered for this requirement is between 1,190 and 1,700 CF every week (between 61,880 and 88,400 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 10 months, beginning July 1, 2015 and ending January 31, 2016, with the option to extend up to four additional years.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 2242 W North Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84116. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building, located north (behind) of the main building.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: The helium storage space has dimensions of 12'x20'x10'(WxLxH) and can safely store various configurations of cylinders, from individual cylinders, to 12- or 16-packs at a time. Although the site is flexible for the configuration, we officially prefer the helium be provided in six-packs; other configurations will be accepted only if no other option can be reasonably made available. All contemplated configurations must have rates included in the quote sheet provided during the solicitation stage of the pre-award process. We cannot accept gas at rates outside the quoted price.</p>
<p>Regardless of the configuration, it is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 510 and 1,700 CF of helium, with a minimum of 1,190 CF being used every week, leaving approximately a three-day supply of helium (510 CF) as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. Actual usage will vary based on the need for additional balloon launches.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall occur on a weekly basis, with the delivery schedule arranged with the NWS Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), Observation Program Lead (OPL) or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 9 below for contact information).</p>
<p>Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within two business days of being contacted. This schedule may need to be further adjusted if at any time the helium is delivered in other-than-six-packs. <br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 9 below, shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Performing Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply to the Place of Performance 1,700 CF of helium, in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. Thereafter, the Contractor will replenish back to 1,700 CF of helium on a weekly basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty helium cylinders with full helium cylinders. The Contractor shall pickup the empty cylinders in the same trip.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. NWS personnel will accompany the driver to the delivery point to unlock the storage area. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>In the event of a shortage of helium supply by the Contractor or their supplier, the Contractor is responsible for communicating the shortage to the NWS as soon as possible, but no less than two days prior to the next scheduled delivery. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase helium from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium to 1,700 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>8. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the NWS office in Salt Lake City are:</p>
<p>Observation Program Leader <br />Administrative Support Assistant <br />Meteorologist In-Charge</p>
<p>The above parties can be reached by telephone at 801-524-4378.</p>
<p>9. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices shall be sent to the following address:</p>
<p>National Weather Service<br />Weather Forecast Office<br />2242 W North Temple<br />Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>

<p><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Department of Labor (DOL<br />Wage and Hour Division (WHD)<br />Prevailing Wage Seminar<br />BALTIMORE, MD<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">August 24-27, 2015</span></p>
<p>PART 1<br />GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing some of our nation's most comprehensive federal labor laws, including the minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, youth employment and special employment, family and medical leave, migrant workers, lie detector tests, worker protections in certain temporary worker programs, and prevailing wages for government service and construction contracts.</p>
<p>The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) Prevailing Wage Seminars (Prevailing Wage Seminars) are three-day compliance trainings designed for community stakeholders. The compliance trainings cover topics on Non-Displacement, the Davis-Bacon Act and McNamara O'Hara Service Contract Act, the process of obtaining wage determination and adding classification, the process for appealing wage rates, coverage, and compliance determinations.</p>
<p>Prevailing Wage Seminars are emblematic of WHD's enhanced commitment to prevailing wage enforcement. These highly acclaimed seminars have significantly enhanced communications and collaboration with some of our most important stakeholders, such as the building trades labor organizations. Our increased enforcement has also significantly elevated interest and attendance by government contractors and contracting agency representatives at our Prevailing Wage Seminars. Previous seminars have averaged more than 300 attendees and are a valuable tool in promoting and enhancing WHD's government contracts prevailing wage and enforcement programs.</p>
<p>In addition, Prevailing Wage Seminars are a mission critical component of WHD's overall enforcement strategy. WHD believes that providing contractors and contracting agency staff with compliance assistance training prior to contract award significantly reduces unintentional errors and permits WHD to target its limited enforcement resources on the egregious violators.</p>
<p>1.1 OBJECTIVES</p>

WHD will require meeting space to accommodate at least five hundred (500) participants in one large general session room and medium-size rooms for breakout sessions that can accommodate 80 people.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>(VI)</strong> Description of requirements is as follows:<br /><br /><strong>General Information<br /></strong><br /><strong>C.1 Introduction<br /></strong><br />The United States Department of Labor (DOL) has a requirement for the ongoing support of the currently implemented Interactive Intelligence Voice over Internet Protocol/Interactive Voice Response (VoIP/IVR) solution. The DOL Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires contractor support in order to maintain VoIP/IVR services for approximately 4,000 users in over 150 sites across the United States. This support includes but is not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Tier 2 and 3 VoIP and IVR incident/problem management service desk support<br />&bull; System-wide management, maintenance, and improvements<br />&bull; Management of user accounts, work groups, call queues, primary rate interfaces (PRI), fax lines, and office mailboxes;<br />&bull; Device management including Internet Protocol (IP) phones, fax machines, TTY devices, and Pitney Bowes postage machines<br />&bull; IVR call flow scripting and management , automatic call distribution (ACD) management, and business application integration<br />&bull; Network traffic monitoring and testing <br />&bull; DOL OCIO Service Catalog reporting and cost management.<br /><br />In additional to the described VoIP and IVR services, DOL OCIO is in need of continued support of various projects that integrate and modernize current client systems and makes the technology base compliant with Federal, DOL, and OCIO target enterprise architecture standards. The OCIO is continuing to extend, expand, enhance, integrate, and update the existing IT infrastructure and architecture. Software and Services Development and Testing Support are required to support standard development processes, tools, and environments for the entire lifecycle of application development as well as Customer Agency application testing, certification, and release management. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C.1.1 Background Information</span><br />The DOL's implementation of the Interactive Intelligence IVR and VoIP solution set is an integral part of a larger Unified Communication (UC) suite operated by the DOL in support of operations of its various Agencies. Although a common platform, there is a fair amount of customization of the Agency-specific applications, due to Agency specific functional needs and differences in the IT systems supporting individual Agencies. The Agency overall IT environment is known as the General Support Systems (GSS).<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integration with GSS:<br /></span>The VoIP solution is fully integrated with the DOL OCIO GSS, including bi-directional communication with Outlook.com and Office365. This includes the implementation of Unified Communications for email and fax delivery, to both individual users and also to offices and specialty lines.<br />Integration with Agency Applications:<br /><br />The VoIP solution is integrated with a variety of agency applications. This includes caller self-service, screen pops, customer satisfaction surveys, and custom reporting.<br /><br />&bull; The Office of Workers Compensation Program (OWCP) Division of Federal Employment Compensation (DFEC) call flow takes information input by the caller, which is sent to the Integrated Federal Employment Compensation (iFECS) application via web services to validate a case number and determine where to connect the call (office, claims examiner, or customer service representative). As the connection is made, the iFECS application does an application screen pop that tells the receiver of the call who is calling and provides other basic information. If the call isn't answered, the IVR solution allows the caller to leave a message which is then forwarded to the correct claims examiner. <br />&bull; A custom built connector uses the Interactive Intelligence Application Programming Interface (API) to receive notification from the CIC server, and uses iFECS application libraries to send notifications to the iFECS application.<br />&bull; Custom reporting has been developed from the VoIP system for Wage and Hour Division (WHD) applications and business processes. This includes reporting on call volumes, performance statistics, workload analysis, etc.<br />&bull; All OWCP call flows include the ability to take customer satisfaction surveys at the request of the caller. This functionality utilizes an external survey service and seamlessly connects the caller to the survey at the completion of their service call.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C.1.2 Hours of Operations</span><br />Total hours worked per day (Monday-Friday), per full time employee, shall not exceed eight (8) hours without written approval from the Contracting Officer.

<p><strong>(IX)</strong> The provision at <strong>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014)</strong>, applies to this acquisition. Addendum as follows- <br /><br />The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate offers: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-requisite</span></strong> <br />The Government will only consider proposals from prime contractors who <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY </span></strong>have active "ELITE" Level partnership status with Interactive Intelligence at the time of proposal submission. <br /><br /><strong>Evaluation Factors for Award</strong> <br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, Technical and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br /><br />(1) Technical <br />(2) Past Performance<br />(3) Price<br /><br /><strong>Basis of Award</strong><br /><br />Best Value <br /><br />The non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Technical is more important than Past Performance and, Past Performance is more important than Price. Obtaining superior technical features is most important to the Government; however, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical features. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f) the Government anticipates awarding the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Support contract to a single offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government and whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government, based on the best overall offer and that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government with appropriate consideration given to all the evaluation factors. All Subfactors under Volume I, Technical are of equal importance. <br /><br /><strong>Quality and Adherence<br /></strong>Offerors are responsible for ensuring that information they provide is thorough, accurate, and complete. All information shall be confined to the appropriate volume and in the specified location. Failure to submit information in the appropriate volume and specified location may result in finding that the proposal is NOT acceptable.<br /><br /><strong>Rejection of Unrealistic Proposals</strong><br />Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment, or unrealistically low in price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of competence, or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity associated with the DOL IVR support requirements. This may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.<br /><br /><strong>Options</strong><br />The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The total price offered (base year, option period(s), will be used as the overall evaluated price.<br /><br /><strong>Discussions<br /></strong>The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest and/or waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br /><br /><strong>Competitive Range</strong><br />Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f) (4), the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Those proposals not included in the competitive range will receive no further consideration.<br /><br /><strong>Evaluation<br /><br />Factor 1: Technical<br /></strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subfactor 1: Understanding the Requirement</span> <br />The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed, described in the SOW, demonstrated understanding of the work described in this solicitation and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subfactor 2: Staffing and Recruiting Approach<br /></span>The Government will evaluate the offeror's overall management approach and staffing plan, including the proposed management structure for personnel with responsibilities for this contract by task area, and their explanation of how that structure will work in ensuring successful task performance, and compliance with all requirements of the SOW. The contractor shall include discussion of the use of and management of any subcontractors, as applicable. The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror's approach includes an effective management structure, responsibility descriptions, successful task performance/requirements completion checks, and the experience of management personnel in conducting similar operations with relevant backgrounds, training, and education as well as the appropriate level of experience in all aspects required by the Government IVR support contract. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subfactor 3: Key Personnel<br /></span>The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposal regarding the experience and qualifications of all key personnel. The offeror's TECHNICAL Volume V shall include REDACTED resumes for key personnel.<br /><br /><em>Accuracy of Resumes: <br /></em>&bull; The offeror shall provide resumes of key personnel and certify the accuracy of all resumes proposed for assignment on the Task Order award, and/or for future assignment of personnel to the award.<br />&bull; Failure to provide detailed documents outlining qualifications, education, board certifications, hours of practice, place of practice, copy of license, to include a copy of the proposed candidates valid certifications (for applicable candidates) will result in a finding that the offer is not acceptable.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subfactor 4 - Corporate Experience and Qualifications<br /></span>The Government will assess the offerors description of its qualifications and detail of its specific experience conducting work of the same and/or similar nature of that described in Section C of the RFP. The Government will assess the extent of the offerors experience in providing creative, innovative solutions for the customer's benefit. The Government will evaluate the offeror's corporate capability to provide effectively the required services. The attributes comprising such capability include, among others, corporate and financial stability, corporate processes, corporate organization, quality assurance processes, and employee attrition and retention rates. These capabilities also include experience with similar projects and access to staff with the knowledge, education and experience required to successfully meet the IVR requirements.<br />The prime contractor must be appraised at CMMI Maturity Level 3 within 12 months of the contract effective date.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subfactor 5: Transition-In /Transition-Out</span><br />The Government will evaluate the Transition-In Plan to determine if it offers a reasonable, effective and realistic approach to quality control for assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption or degradation of performance. The plan will be evaluated on whether it identifies risk, proposes appropriate mitigation strategies, and proposes a realistic, achievable and affordable start-up schedule and staffing plan. The plan will be evaluated on whether it ensures sufficient resources are on hand and available to begin work under this requirement. It shall include a statement that the personnel proposed are available, trained, and qualified to perform the work under this effort. In addition the government will evaluate the Transition-Out Plan on whether it provides a smooth transition to replacement services when the contract period of performance ends. <br /><br />Technical Volume(s) will be evaluated using the following scale:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating and Adjective Standard</span><br /><strong>Exceeds:</strong> Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of requirements and an approach that exceeds performance or capability standards. It has strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror's proposed approach is likely to cause minimal or no disruption of schedule or degradation of performance, and will require a low level of offeror emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties.<br /><strong>Acceptable:</strong> Proposal demonstrates acceptable understanding of requirements and an approach that meets performance or capability standards. It has few or no strengths and may have some minor weaknesses. The offeror's proposed approach is likely to cause a moderate disruption of schedule or degradation of performance, and will require a medium level of offeror emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties.<br /><strong>Unacceptable:</strong> Fails to meet performance or capability standards. Requirements can only be met with major changes to the proposal. The offeror's proposed approach is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule or degradation of performance, and will require a high level of offeror emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties.<br /><br /><strong>Factor 2: Past Performance<br /></strong><br />The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which their past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance as the IVR support contract holder in delivering high quality service and solutions within scope of Section C of the RFP. <br /><br />The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 2 Offeror's shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted directly to the Government. The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) previous contracts for current relevancy (3 years), provided via the attached questionnaire, each with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the offeror performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity.</p>
<p>As provided in FAR 15.608(a) (2), past performance information may also be obtained from other sources known to the Government.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated using the following scale:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adjectival and Description</span><br /><strong>Low Risk:</strong> Little doubt exists on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><strong>Moderate Risk:</strong> Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><strong>High Risk:</strong> Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><strong>Unknown Risk:</strong> Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.<br /><br />&bull; Past performance references for offerors that performed work as a subcontractor to a prime contractor will be accepted provided that the work is relevant and distinguishable from the work performed by the prime. <br />&bull; Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the CO reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. The Government intends to evaluate the proposals and award a contract, without discussions with the offerors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.<br />&bull; Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 4: Price<br /></strong><br />Price will be evaluated in terms of completeness. Offerors shall complete the Supplies or Services/Prices page(s) in Attachment 1, of the solicitation with pricing for the base and each option period. DOL requires that a Labor rate is quoted for each labor category identified and or proposed, for the base and each option period. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation of Options:</span> Except when it is determined not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise option periods.<br /><br />No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest Policy</span><br />Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): The policy of DOL is to avoid contracting with contractors who have unacceptable organizational conflicts of interest. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of existing or planned activities, an offeror or Contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance to the agency, or has an unfair competitive advantage, or the offeror or Contractor's objectivity is, or might be, impaired. If the offeror does not have any OCI issues, it must positively affirm so in writing.</p>
<p>The following provides the contractor with examples of situations where mitigation plans may or may not be required by DOL. These examples are not intended to be inclusive.<br /><br />Disclosure by offerors or contractors participating in a DOL acquisition. Offerors or contractors should provide information which concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interest, (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether the offeror or contractor has a possible OCI.</p>
<p>If the offeror or Contractor does not disclose any relevant facts concerning an OCI, the offeror or Contractor, by submitting an offer or signing the contract, warrants that to its best knowledge and belief, no such facts exist relevant to possible OCI.</p>
<p>It is not the intention of DOL to exclude a Contractor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI. DOL Contracting Officers are fully empowered to evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances. The final determination of such action may be negotiated between the impaired Contractor and the DOL Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer's business judgment and sound discretion in identifying, negotiating, and eliminating OCI scenarios should not adversely affect DOL's policy for competition. DOL is committed to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and perceived OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the mission of DOL, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community.</p>
<p>Mitigation plans: The successful Contractor will be required to permit a Government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for verification purposes. DOL reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is not in the best interest of DOL. After award, DOL will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed (in the event of any changes due to mergers, consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest).</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Life Technologies, located in Carlsbad, CA for one (1) QuantStudio 7 Flex 96 Well Real-Time PCR System.<br /><br />This equipment will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br /><br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br /><br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.  <br /><br />Life Technologies is the sole manufacturer of the QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System.  The QuantStudio 7 Flex is mission essential as a replacement of the retiring 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. Real-Time PCR is a key assay in support of The Surgical Critical Care Initiative (SC2i).  SC2i is an ongoing scientific research initiative tasked with the mission for identification of differential gene expression in wound healing outcome, development of heterotopic ossification, and identification of bacterial colonization both in acute wounds and in patients with traumatic brain injury. The QuantStudio 7 Flex will meet our minimum requirements of being compatible with a custom selection of 190 target genes, plus a housekeeping gene of interest, in a single low-density array (card).  The QuantStudio 7 Flex provides comparable quantitative PCR efficiency with currently used equipment (the 7900HT) which is critical as we are mid-study and to purchase a different system could compromise past and future data and waste valuable research funds.
<p><br />The QuantStudio 7 Flex is manufactured by Applied BioSystems, now a part of Life Technologies, and the OEM of the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System being replaced.  It is compatible with the TaqMan Low-Density Array parts and supplies that have already been purchased for ongoing clinical studies. Maintaining compatibility with processes and legacy data and also utilizing the government's investment in proprietary supplies are critical to the success of this ongoing study.  This instrument is uniquely qualified for replacing our current equipment, which has been discontinued, as it is manufactured by the same company and is one of the recommended replacements for highest compatibility between legacy data and future data collections. The QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System provides the technology and capabilities to meet our current quantitative Real-Time PCR detection protocols as well as offer ease of use with streamlined workflows in our Molecular Core Lab.</p>
<p>Life Technologies is the only known source that can provided the requested equipment.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (carolyn.randolph@usuhs.edu) by 5:00 p.m. EST on 18 May 2015.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show -- (1) The solicitation number; (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (5) Terms of any express warranty; (6) Price and any discount terms; (7) ?Remit to? address, if different than mailing address; (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender?s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. <BR> <BR>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and? (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government?s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. <BR> <BR>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. ((h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

Vendor Questions
1.	Page 6 - Period of Performance. Base Period is listed as "Qty 12" 06/01/15 - 04/30/16, although this is only an 11 month span of time. Base Period is an 11 month requirement from 06/01/15 through 04/30/2016. See amendment P0002.

2.	During my site visit to the Main Hospital last month, I observed two employees stack parking employee cars in a back parking lot.  I don't see this reflected anywhere in the RFP.  Is this a requirement? Yes, it is a requirement. See amendment P0002 and paragraphs 6.b (3) and 6.b (4) in the solicitation. 

3.	The solicitation states that there will be 200 patient parking spaces after 12/1/2015.  When I counted the number of spaces in the lower/overflow parking lot, I saw 302.  Please clarify if that entire lot or only a portion will be for valet use.  Only a portion of the lot will be for valet use.  The exact utilization of the remaining parking spaces in the lower/overflow parking lot is still being discussed by the facility parking committee.

4.	Can you provide a twelve month history of the daily valet patient parking volume?  Ideally this would show a detailed breakdown by hour, but whatever detail is available will suffice.  If data is not available for some reason, can you provide commentary on the expected volume on various days of the week or times of day?  A spreadsheet is attached and provides total vehicles parked per day, each day, for the months of July 2014, August 2014, September 2014, October 2014, January 2015, February 2015 and March 2015.

5.	As discussed, please provide clarification on the appropriate occupation code to use for the shuttle drivers.  The contractor will follow the attached Wage Determination No. 2005-2057, Revision No. 16 which states that the rate for a Shuttle Bus Driver is $14.66, regardless of the size of the vehicle the Government decides to provide for shuttle services.

6.	The solicitation requires two shuttle drivers, but during the site visit I saw three shuttles being operated.  Please clarify the number of shuttles that will be covered by this contract.  The number of shuttles that will be covered by the contract will be the number of shuttles outlined in the current solicitation.

<DESC><strong><strong>4 MAY 2015:<br /><br />SOLICITATION NOTICE:</strong> <strong>This is an RFP, which will result in a single&nbsp;contract award.&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Please see the solictation package and information provided in the presolicitation notice posted on 30 MAR 2015. <br /><br /><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><br /><br />30 MAR 2015<br />PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:</strong><br /><br />NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Presolicitation Synopsis as required by FAR 5.2.
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the market that the Air Force intends to solicit Thales Visionix, Inc. on a sole-source basis and to negotiate a single award contract for the procurement of Spare Equipment for the Scorpion <sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment to support the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The proposed NAICS Code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, which has a corresponding size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Based on FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The proposed contract action is one for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. If your firm does not agree with this determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above services for evaluation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The proposed contract action shall not exceed one year and is estimated to be awarded in June 2015 and end in November 2015.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The A-10 aircraft users have integrated the Thales Visionix, Inc. (TVI) Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment into war fighting capabilities. The HMCS components were developed solely by TVI and due to the proprietary nature of this specialized technology it is not commercially available, which makes TVI the only firm capable of meeting the technical requirement to diagnose, repair and replace the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> HMCS equipment..</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This effort is to procure Spare Equipment for the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment for the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The Contractor will have to provide the following equipment:</p>
<p>ICS Rotable Pool<br />Item&nbsp; PartNumber&nbsp;&nbsp; Description<br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V14032-401&nbsp; HVI, HRC to Helmet <br />2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A12920-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PD-14<br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13055-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICU Input Filter Board Assy<br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13044-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICU Base Board<br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13022-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CM800 ICU CCA<br />6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13909-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RRT IRC-ICU Cable<br />7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13887-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preflight 24VDC Power Supply Assy<br /><br />C-Kit Replenishment<br />Item&nbsp;&nbsp; PartNumber&nbsp;&nbsp; Description<br />8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A12820-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HRS Mounting Strap<br />9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A12937-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Day Visor Assembly (DVA) <br />10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13017-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spacer Block w/wiring (NVG Mount)<br />11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13095-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QDC Mounting Block (QMB)<br />12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13415-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens Cleaner Pouch<br />13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13623-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HVI Clamp Assembly<br />14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A13918-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVA/NVG Storage Bag</p>
<p>Due to the proprietary nature of this requirement, the Contractor must have applied knowledge of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment. Please note, comparable parts will not be considered as they are not authorized or approved for this effort. The Government does not own source data or have data rights for these items. Additional reverse engineering efforts are not being considered at this time.</p>
<p>NOTES</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this synopsis.</p>

<CONTACT>Dieguez, Leslie G
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Lower Colorado Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Biomark, Inc. located in Boise, ID.  The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for 30 units of Allflex RM 310 Interrogator Circuit Board for use of assembly and repair of the Marsh & Associates, Inc. remote sensing modular antennae system and 50, 000 units of HPT12 PIT tag for identifying Razor back Sucker and Bonytail Chub. 
Biomark, Inc. has propriety licensing as the sole distributor of the RM 310 Interrogator Circuit Board by Allflex USA, Inc. Market research determined that no other vendor offers any such interrogator circuit board as a standalone product like the RM 310 Interrogator Circuit Board.  Additionally, all of BORs remote sensing antenna systems manufactured by Marsh & Associates, Inc. utilize the RM 310 Interrogator Circuit Board to produce the electromagnetic field (EMF) necessary to excite the passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag and then read and log the PIT tag alphanumeric code. Therefore, these boards are modular plug and play boards, which allows for easy replacement in the event of a failure without having to reconfigure any other aspect of the antennae circuitry.  Also, Biomark is the sole distributer for the HPT 12 PIT tag, which has been identified as the legacy PIT tag for Native Fish Repatriation program. The manufacturing process for the HPT 12 PIT tag sets the industry standard as the highest number of copper windings around the ferrite core, which is necessary because the higher the windings, the higher the excitation radius. This higher excitation radius assures data capture for those fish that are more distally proximal to the antennaes EMF.  No other vendor has been identified that is able to meet these specifications. 

A Determination to Solicit Sole Source will be prepared in support of this acquisition.

This procurement will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  The anticipated award date is May 22, 2015.  Questions maybe directed to Leslie Dieguez at (702) 293-8369, or by email to ldieguez@usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 and the size standard is 750 employees.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />CMS-2015-RFI-PERM-ERC</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PAYMENT ERROR RATE MEASUREMENT<br />ELIGIBILITY REVIEW CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is issued solely for the purpose of planning and market research. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of large businesses and qualified small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business and woman-owned small business) to support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Financial Management, Provider Compliance Group (PCG), Division of Error Rate Measurement (DERM), and Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program.<br />The information gathered from this market research will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a set-aside is possible. The anticipated NAICS is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services. Interested parties should submit a capability statement to demonstrate their ability to perform the requirements.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>CMS is currently administering a payment error rate measurement program in the Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs. CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and CHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002, amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA). The IPERIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress. The IPERIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.</p>
<p>CMS implemented the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) methodology to produce state and national error rates for fee-for-service claims, managed care capitation payments, and eligibility determinations. Currently, federal contractors perform the review of fee-for-service and managed care payments while states conduct their own review of eligibility determinations.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act created significant changes to Medicaid and CHIP eligibility applicable to all states regardless of their decision to expand Medicaid. These program changes include:</p>
<p>&bull; Use of Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) methodologies for income determinations and household composition;<br />&bull; Use of a single streamlined application (or approved alternative) for intake of applicant information;<br />&bull; Availability of multiple channels to consumers for submitting application information (by mail, fax, phone or on-line); <br />&bull; Use of a HHS-managed data services hub for access to federal verification sources; <br />&bull; Need for account transfers and data sharing between the Marketplace, Medicaid, and CHIP to avoid rework or confusion by consumers; and <br />&bull; Reliance on data-driven processes for 12 month renewals.</p>
<p>These changes required redesign of many Medicaid and CHIP business operations and systems, and interaction with other state and federal partners. Accordingly, the current methodologies applied to measurement of eligibility accuracy under PERM need to be updated to reflect the changes states are making to their eligibility policies and systems. Furthermore, the interaction of the Marketplaces with Medicaid and CHIP, including the cross-program interdependencies and coordination built to create an efficient system of coverage, will need special consideration in the planning of future program measurements and accountability.</p>
<p>Traditionally, states have been responsible for the PERM eligibility component, which has required states to develop universes of active and negative cases, randomly sample cases, conduct case reviews to determine whether eligibility was determined or redetermined correctly and collect payments associated with sampled cases. CMS is considering using a federal Eligibility Review Contractor (ERC) to conduct the eligibility reviews for the PERM measurement in all states. Using an ERC will improve the consistency of reviews and reduce the workload for states. Moreover, it will provide CMS with increased oversight of the PERM eligibility component. The ERC will be responsible for:</p>
<p>&bull; Collecting, updating, and maintaining all state and federal policies related to Medicaid and CHIP eligibility;<br />&bull; Obtaining access to state eligibility systems;<br />&bull; Working with the states to develop a complete universe of eligible active and negative CHIP and Medicaid cases;<br />&bull; Drawing a sample of cases from the universe;<br />&bull; Conducting eligibility case and payment reviews; and<br />&bull; Reporting findings to the states and resolving any discrepancies between their findings and the states' expectations.</p>
<p>Overview of the Requirements</p>
<p>Interested parties should demonstrate that they possess the experience and/or the ability to provide the full range of services outlined below:</p>
<p>1) Conducting eligibility reviews for the 17 states in each PERM cycle, including assisting states with universe development, drawing a random sample of cases, conducting eligibility case reviews, and collecting payments associated with sampled cases;<br />2) Collecting, updating, and maintaining state and federal Medicaid and CHIP eligibility policies, which includes conducting research on state eligibility procedures and systems as it pertains to caseworker actions and systems interactions in making eligibility determinations;<br />3) Accessing state eligibility and payment systems, which may require onsite travel; <br />4) Requesting, obtaining, and storing eligibility data from state eligibility systems and case files;<br />5) Conducting eligibility review of sampled eligibility applicants to determine whether the state determined the applicants' eligibility in accordance with state and federal policies and procedures; <br />6) Collecting payments associated with sampled eligibility applicants; <br />7) Communicating findings to the states and working with the states to resolve any disagreements about the findings; <br />8) Designing, building, maintaining, enhancing, and hosting a PERM eligibility review website for the purposes of tracking findings and reporting; and<br />9) Serving as a consultant to the PERM program, assisting states/CMS in developing corrective actions, and collaborating with CMS and other contractors to compose cycle summary and PERM final reports.</p>
<p>Capability Statement Information<br />Interested parties should demonstrate that they possess the following capabilities in their capability statements:</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge of IPERIA requirements and understanding of overall PERM goals;<br />&bull; Strong understanding of national and state Medicaid and CHIP eligibility policy and Affordable Care Act requirements and how such policies impact the eligibility review;<br />&bull; Documented working knowledge of state eligibility and payment systems and determination processes;<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience reviewing Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations; <br />&bull; Resource capacity to conduct case and payment reviews across 17 states in a given cycle within required timeframes, as outlined by CMS; and<br />&bull; Proven experience working with state Medicaid and CHIP agencies</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is an update to the status of the Combat Environment Simulation (CES) follow-on requirements at NAWCWPNS.
<p>The objective of the Combat Environment Simulation Systems (CESS) Branch at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, California, is the research, development, delivery, sustainment, and upgrade of threat systems and associated software used for pre-deployment aircrew warfighter training and weapons systems test and evaluation (T&amp;E) at Department of Defense (DOD) Allied training and T&amp;E Ranges.</p>
<p>The follow-on will entail three separate competitions to fulfill the requirements being met under the current Multiple Award Contract (MAC). The first competition will be T&amp;E/Training Threat/Target Systems (T4S), which will provide warfighter training and debriefing systems; the second will be the Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactical Training Range (AEWTTR), which will provide ground Electronic Warfare (EW) and Surface-to-Air (SA) weapons threats; and the third will be the Combat Environment Instrumentation Systems (CEIS), which will provide time-space-position information (TSPI) instrumentation and unmanned threats and targets.</p>
<p>Based on market research, Industry response, one-on-one discussions with Industry, and Government analysis in Fall 2014; and acquisition strategy approval in March 2015, the strategy will be as follows:</p>
<p>T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS will be solicited as predominantly Supply/Product with some ancillary Services.</p>
<p>T4S and AEWTTR will be solicited as a Single Award, while CEIS will be solicited as a MAC. CEIS will have a small business set-aside component at the Order level to be used as applicable.</p>
<p>T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS will be solicited as Cost Plus Fixed Fee with some Firm Fixed Price line items.</p>
<p>The SOWs for T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS have been revised to remove redundancy.</p>
<p>T4S and AEWTTR will use Scenario-Based Pricing for evaluation. This technique will be used to analyze offerors proposed costs and technical approach, and will entail pricing a sample task or two that will be representative of the work to be performed under this requirement. The scenario(s) provided in the competitive solicitation will fully define, in a SOW, a representative service and/or product that may be ordered under the resultant contract. For CEIS, the use of scenario-based pricing for evaluation purposes has not been determined.</p>
<p>The Draft RFPs are currently scheduled to be released for Industry comment during the July-September timeframe, with some form of Industry Day and/or one-on-one meetings to follow after its release. Award is scheduled for August 2016.</p>
<p>No response is requested at this time. This synopsis is only an update.</p>
<p>The point of contact is Erin Strand, Contract Specialist, at 760-939-7309 or erin.strand@navy.mil. Email is better.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is an update to the status of the Combat Environment Simulation (CES) follow-on requirements at NAWCWPNS.
<p>The objective of the Combat Environment Simulation Systems (CESS) Branch at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, California, is the research, development, delivery, sustainment, and upgrade of threat systems and associated software used for pre-deployment aircrew warfighter training and weapons systems test and evaluation (T&amp;E) at Department of Defense (DOD) Allied training and T&amp;E Ranges.</p>
<p>The follow-on will entail three separate competitions to fulfill the requirements being met under the current Multiple Award Contract (MAC). The first competition will be T&amp;E/Training Threat/Target Systems (T4S), which will provide warfighter training and debriefing systems; the second will be the Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactical Training Range (AEWTTR), which will provide ground Electronic Warfare (EW) and Surface-to-Air (SA) weapons threats; and the third will be the Combat Environment Instrumentation Systems (CEIS), which will provide time-space-position information (TSPI) instrumentation and unmanned threats and targets.</p>
<p>Based on market research, Industry response, one-on-one discussions with Industry, and Government analysis in Fall 2014; and acquisition strategy approval in March 2015, the strategy will be as follows:</p>
<p>T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS will be solicited as predominantly Supply/Product with some ancillary Services.</p>
<p>T4S and AEWTTR will be solicited as a Single Award, while CEIS will be solicited as a MAC. CEIS will have a small business set-aside component at the Order level to be used as applicable.</p>
<p>T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS will be solicited as Cost Plus Fixed Fee with some Firm Fixed Price line items.</p>
<p>The SOWs for T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS have been revised to remove redundancy.</p>
<p>T4S and AEWTTR will use Scenario-Based Pricing for evaluation. This technique will be used to analyze offerors proposed costs and technical approach, and will entail pricing a sample task or two that will be representative of the work to be performed under this requirement. The scenario(s) provided in the competitive solicitation will fully define, in a SOW, a representative service and/or product that may be ordered under the resultant contract.

<DESC>This synopsis is an update to the status of the Combat Environment Simulation (CES) follow-on requirements at NAWCWPNS.
<p>The objective of the Combat Environment Simulation Systems (CESS) Branch at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, California, is the research, development, delivery, sustainment, and upgrade of threat systems and associated software used for pre-deployment aircrew warfighter training and weapons systems test and evaluation (T&amp;E) at Department of Defense (DOD) Allied training and T&amp;E Ranges.</p>
<p>The follow-on will entail three separate competitions to fulfill the requirements being met under the current Multiple Award Contract (MAC). The first competition will be T&amp;E/Training Threat/Target Systems (T4S), which will provide warfighter training and debriefing systems; the second will be the Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactical Training Range (AEWTTR), which will provide ground Electronic Warfare (EW) and Surface-to-Air (SA) weapons threats; and the third will be the Combat Environment Instrumentation Systems (CEIS), which will provide time-space-position information (TSPI) instrumentation and unmanned threats and targets.</p>
<p>Based on market research, Industry response, one-on-one discussions with Industry, and Government analysis in Fall 2014; and acquisition strategy approval in March 2015, the strategy will be as follows:</p>
<p>T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS will be solicited as predominantly Supply/Product with some ancillary Services.</p>
<p>T4S and AEWTTR will be solicited as a Single Award, while CEIS will be solicited as a MAC. CEIS will have a small business set-aside component at the Order level to be used as applicable.</p>
<p>T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS will be solicited as Cost Plus Fixed Fee with some Firm Fixed Price line items.</p>
<p>The SOWs for T4S, AEWTTR, and CEIS have been revised to remove redundancy.</p>
<p>T4S and AEWTTR will use Scenario-Based Pricing for evaluation. This technique will be used to analyze offerors proposed costs and technical approach, and will entail pricing a sample task or two that will be representative of the work to be performed under this requirement. The scenario(s) provided in the competitive solicitation will fully define, in a SOW, a representative service and/or product that may be ordered under the resultant contract. For CEIS, the use of scenario-based pricing for evaluation purposes has not been determined.</p>
<p>The Draft RFPs are currently scheduled to be released for Industry comment during the July-September timeframe, with some form of Industry Day and/or one-on-one meetings to follow after its release. Award is scheduled for August 2016.</p>
<p>No response is requested at this time. This synopsis is only an update.</p>
<p>The point of contact is Erin Strand, Contract Specialist, at 760-939-7309 or erin.strand@navy.mil. Email is better.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is hereby issued to extend the proposal due date to May 21, 2015, at 4:00PM, Central Standard Time.  In addition, please note that answers to all submitted questions will be posted on or about May 6, 2015. This amendment is also issued to incorporate FAR clause 52-225-9 Buy American Act-Construction Materials into the Solicitation.
<p>Buy American Act-Construction Materials (SEP 2010)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-<br />Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item-(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is-<br />(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101);<br />(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and<br />(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and<br />(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.<br />Construction material means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material.<br />Cost of components means-<br />(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or<br />(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the construction material.<br />Domestic construction material means-<br />(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States;<br />(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if-<br />(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic; or<br />(ii) The construction material is a COTS item.<br />Foreign construction material means a construction material other than a domestic construction material.<br />United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.<br />(b) Domestic preference. (1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d) by providing a preference for domestic construction material. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for construction material that is a COTS item (See FAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause.<br />(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial item or to the construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows:<br />(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that-<br />(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent;<br />(ii) The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or<br />(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.<br />(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including-<br />(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials;<br />(B) Unit of measure;<br />(C) Quantity;<br />(D) Price;<br />(E) Time of delivery or availability;<br />(F) Location of the construction project;<br />(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and<br />(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.<br />(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause.<br />(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued).<br />(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.<br />(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause.<br />(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program.<br />(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:<br />Foreign and Domestic Construction Materials Price Comparison<br />Construction material description<br />Unit of measure	Quantity	Price (dollars) 1<br />Include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued).<br />List name, address, telephone number, and contact for suppliers surveyed. Attach copy of response; if oral, attach summary.<br />Include other applicable supporting information.<br />Item 1			<br />Foreign construction material			<br />Domestic construction material			<br />Item 2			<br />Foreign construction material			<br />Domestic construction material			<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>The American Proficiency Institute is one of the largest proficiency testing providers in the world<br />serving over 18,000 laboratories. API changed the face of proficiency testing by being the first<br />to provide liquid chemistry samples, complete blood count with automated differential, blood cell<br />photographs, practitioner-performed microscopy.</p>
<p>Through its innovative processes, the American Proficiency Institute offers paperless proficiency<br />testing, free continuing education credits, rapid turnaround time, large peer group assessments,<br />management reports, and excellent customer service.</p>
<p>Proficiency Testing (PT) provides a documented, objective assessment of a laboratory's ability<br />to produce accurate results. A PT provider, an external, independent organization, sends blind<br />samples to participating laboratories. The laboratories analyze the samples and return the<br />results to the PT provider. The PT provider then compares their results to other laboratories,<br />applies grading criteria, and provides a "report card" to the laboratory with copies available to<br />appropriate government and accrediting agencies.</p>
<p>Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), all moderate and high<br />complexity laboratories are required to participate in PT.</p>

The current BPA Ordering Period was set to expire on April 29, 2015. This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limited Sources Justification and Approval". The proposed 6-month BPA extension is to continue the leasing and maintenance capability of X-Ray Machines and Ancillary Equipment from April 30, 2015 to October 31, 2015 at an approximate value of $776,867.28. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is there is only one source capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Protective Service (FPS) has a requirement to secure on a limited source basis in continuing the leasing and maintenance capability of X-Ray Machines and Ancillary Equipment at various locations throughout the United States until award of a competitive follow-on contract is made and completed.<br />The six month period shall allow the Government the necessary time to conduct discussions, adequately document its source selection, issue the award and allow for transition.

Other Than Full and Open Competition {>$150K)

1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, The Mann-Grandstaff Medical Center has the requirement to continue uninterrupted Primary Care Services for veterans in the
Lincoln County, MT Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) utilizingoooooooooo
 	 

2.	Nature and/ or Description of the Acti on Being Processed: The Mann-Grandstaff VAMC is currently conducting an internal audit to determine the best avenue for providing Primary Care Services for the veterans at the Lincoln.County, MT Community Base Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). Until the audit results can be reviewed for viability and implemented the Mann-Grandstaff VAMC requires services to continue with the incumbent contractor to ensure uninterrupted services to Veterans in the  CBOC catchment area. The current contract (VA260-P-0771) expires May 31,2015 and there are no options or extensions available.

3.



4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires  the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1,no other sources can provide the services required for this procurement. Additionally, due to Impending expiration of the current contract there is not sufficient time available to properly process this requirement in accordance with the Medical Sharing Office's review requirements. The VA should have a decision made and implemented before the expiration of this bridge contract. This will allow sufficient time for a proper long term solicitation to be completed and transition from one contractor to another, if necessary. The current contractor meets the VA's standards for performance in providing primary care services to eligible beneficiaries.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: This is a follow-on contract with the incumbent contractor that will allow uninterrupted services to continue at the Lincoln County, MT CBOC.
