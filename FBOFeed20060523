The U.S. Forest Service smokejumper program is in need of procuring FS-14 main parachute canopies over a two-year period.

Copies of these drawings will be made available to vendors at the time of solicitation. Due to proprietary considerations, patterns required to manufacture the FS-14 will only be given to the successful offeror.

The BAA Proposal Information Packet will be distributed on or before June 30, 2006 solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO website.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO website to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  This acquisition is being issued as BAA-0007476.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to neither fund any subsequently invited proposals, nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set-aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government’s needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i).

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice 
Broad Agency Announcement VS-06-04
Air Force Research Laboratory
Space Vehicles Directorate

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in space and missile technology; specifically, in the Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS): The Alternative Infrared Satellite System (AIRSS) program is being managed by the Developmental Planning Directorate of the Air Force Space and Missile Command (SMC/XR).  AIRSS is a parallel program to the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) High geosynchronous satellite number 3 (GEO 3).  The decision to produce GEO 3 or AIRSS will be dependent on developmental success of the geosynchronous satellites, and the technical maturity demonstrated by AIRSS.  The decision is expected to be made in FY08.

To help support the FY08 decision gate, the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is executing Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS) under SMC/XR support.  The overarching goal of RR-AIRSS is to raise the maturity of the critical technologies through component and system-level performance test, environmental test and flight qualification.  The goal of RR-AIRSS is to produce the quantitative data needed to define a highly-reliable AIRSS Program Baseline for Functional Design, Budget, and Schedule and enable a low-risk on-ramp into SBIRS if needed.  The RR-AIRSS is soliciting proposals in 2 general areas: 

Topic 1.  Integrated AIRSS Payload Experiments:  Candidate infrared (IR) payloads will be assembled from components with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and seek quantitative systems-level verification through ground performance and environmental test.  The integrated payloads will be tested for performance comparison to SBIRS and DSP-like requirements.   The integrated payloads will be fully flight-qualified through environmental testing focused on vibration, shock, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  This approach is designed to offer the most iron-clad risk reduction for AIRSS, as opposed to striving for the greatest possible payload performance.

Topic 2.  Critical AIRSS Component Development:  Design work under Topic 1 is expected to identify key areas where technology development at the component level will have major impact on the systems-level performance of the integrated payload.  Topic 2 will solicit proposals at the component level for technology development and component-level flight qualification.  Component level elements of primary interest include, but are not limited to, large area focal plane arrays, cryocoolers, advanced data processing hardware and algorithms, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) telescopes.  The goal of efforts funded under Topic 2 will be to provide quantitative data or demonstrated capability needed to include the component in an integrated payload.  Where applicable, components should be environmentally tested for suitability in a flight system.

This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN.  Specific security guidance can be addressed to the Security Point of Contact listed below. This acquisition involves data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and RR-AIRSS technical data are subject to export controls. All prospective offerors shall have appropriate clearances to participate in this acquisition.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel, required facilities, automated information system (AIS) and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification is required.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>GROUNDS MAINTENANCE

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number FA8601-06-R-0047 is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09, Effective 19 Apr 2006 and & Class Deviation 2005-o0001. This acquisition is 100% set aside for HUBZone concerns. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561730 and the associated size standard is $6,500,000. This requirement is for grounds maintenance on vacant units and some common areas in Green Acres and Pine Estates, Base housing areas located at
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The number of units and common areas requiring
grounds maintenance will vary per call for service. The Government will
provide a list of units and common areas as maintenance is required (see
estimated workload in attached Statement of Work (SOW) and below). A Firm Fixed Price type contract is anticipated with a 12 month base period and one 12-month option period.   Service is normally to be performed bi- weekly during the months of April to November (during the growing season).   It is anticipated that the base and option periods will each have two contract line items (CLINs): One line item for Grounds Maintenance for vacant units which includes estimated quantities for mowing and trimming service; and another CLIN for Grounds Maintenance for common areas which includes estimated quantities for mowing and trimming service. An estimated workload is between 100 and 195 for the vacant units, varying square footage of 10,730 and 10,153. This estimate of 100 -195 is for each time a call is placed by the Government for mowing. The two common areas, estimated at 11,000 SF each, may need to be mowed each time a call is placed to mow vacant units. If common areas do not require mowing, the contractor will be so informed at time of call. The total number of calls made during the entire contract period depends on the weather and growth rate of grass. Period of Performance for the base period is 07 Jun 2006 -31 May 2007.  The Period of Performance for the option year is 01 Jun 2007-31 May 2008.  IMPORTANT NOTICE TO POTENTIAL SOURCES(S):  Due to potential privatization of the WPAFB base military housing, services requested in this announcement; future announcements and procurement documents; and any resulting award may be terminated, in whole, prior to, during, or after award.  All sources responding to this announcement are advised that the modification to terminate the requirements prior to, during, after award, or during contract performance, by the Government shall be made without additional cost or claim to the Government.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296.

    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair 
and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was 
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and 
time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is 
empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General 
Accounting Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast 
Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest 
with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or 
Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast 
Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to 
the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the 
concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for 
Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time 
requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a 
timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the 
Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and 
solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency 
protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the 
contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are 
unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, 
the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in 
writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best 
interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 
calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at 
FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within 
the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program 
should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in anticipation of an award of contract(s) to acquire U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body (defined below) approved contraceptive implant along with the insertion device to USAID.  The base quantity is 72,000 sets.
  
A stringent regulatory authority (SRA) is a drug regulatory body that closely resembles FDA in standards utilized in its operations. Currently, countries that participate in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) are considered to have stringent regulatory authorities. The ICH regulatory bodies include: the U.S. FDA; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare; the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) centralized procedure; and the European Free Trade Area (represented by the Swiss Medic). The Canadian drug regulatory authority, the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, is an observer to the ICH and is also considered a stringent regulatory authority. Other countries may be considered to have a stringent regulatory body if they have implemented ICH guidelines and resemble the U.S. FDA in operation, but would be considered by USAID on a case-by-case basis. 

The implants supplied to USAID under this contract shall have the expiration dating approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body of 60 months (5 years).  

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract(s) resulting from this solicitation.
 
The Offeror must supply the following documentation to USAID:
(1)       Complete product description,   
(2)	evidence that the implants offered in response to this solicitation are manufactured in an ISO 9000 approved facility, 
(3)	evidence that the product and production/manufacturing facility have been approved by U.S. FDA or other stringent regulatory body, 
(4)	evidence that the product shelf life approved by U.S. FDA or stringent regulatory body is 5 years, 
(5)	long term stability data, 
(6)	any data to support that the product does not require climate controlled transport and storage, and
(7)	documented proof of any current registrations and in-process registrations.

Products purchased under this contract are for developing countries for use in family planning programs supported by USAID and in a full range of service delivery programs.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract is 935.

Performance under the basic contract shall be from the award date on the face of the contract through December 31, 2007. Four additional option years of performance will be from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011.

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about late March 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.  The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>The Maneuvering and Control Department, Code 5600, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has been tasked to document the hydrodynamic characteristics and to develop predictive tools for wave load impacts. NSWCCD is already using COMET as its calculation tool for wave load impacts. Changing and using other programs at this time is cost prohibitive as well as a delay to providing better and safer wave load impacts to the fleet.In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to ADAPC0. NSWC requires to have a continued site license for four (4) copies of this specialized software to allow continuation and validation of the software as accurately reflecting the impact loads of slapping and slamming waves. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.   A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 2/10/2006.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to place a contract with Photo Research, Inc. for Special Purpose Photometers, P/N PR-1500 with case, that will be used with the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Operational Test Program Sets (OTPSs). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Photo Research, Inc., 9731 Topanga Canyon Place, Chatsworth, CA 91311-4135, U.S.A. under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c ) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Photo Research, Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of this item. The PR-1500 is the only product that meets the critical technical parameters for the Government’s requirements. These parameters include:

Sensitivity:  .01 to 2500 Foot-Lamberts
Focus range: 1.75 inches to infinity
Spectral response: CIE (Human) response using photopic filter
Objective lens: 55mm, f/2.8 macro lens
Aperture size: 1 degree
Accuracy: ±4% of full scale on any range
Calibration: internal calibration standard
Weight: <9 lbs
Power requirements: 117 volts, ±13 volts, 50 to 400 Hz
Operating Temperature: 0ºC to 43ºC
Tripod mountable with .250-20 UNC threaded mount, at least .30 inches deep
100% compatibility (no modifications) with existing fleet OTPSs

Photo Research, Inc. is the only source for this item. The government has conducted extensive market research, including internet searches and review of manufacturers’ sales literature. No other source capable of producing the specified item has been identified. In addition, procurement of a different configuration of photometer would result in significant impacts to existing CASS OTPSs. The OTPSs contain specific written and pictorial instructions for operation of the photometer during testing. Procurement of a different photometer would result in significant cost to the government for modification of these OTPSs. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for 1 ea. Stereo Cloud Particle Spectromenter to include 1 ea. Custom Hermetically-sealed Probe Canister. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Spec Inc., 3022 Sterling Circle, Ste. 200, Boulder, CO 80301; Lack of competition is based on the following: NASA is involved in an icing flight research program with the FAA and other commercial aircraft companies to characterize icing conditions which are causing commercial aircraft engines to ice up and flame-out. These conditions which occur at high altitude are known to be associated with extremely high levels of cloud water content. Accurate cloud characterization is a key atmospheric measurement needed to characterize these severe icing conditions, and thereby facilitate the development of a technical solution to the engine icing program. Research tests by NASA and other atmospheric research agencies have identified that existing cloud physics instruments do not have the necessary capability to accurately measure the cloud physics content under these conditions and be able to discriminate liquid water conditions in mixed phase environment. We experimentally evaluated commercially available icing cloud content probes and cloud physics instrumentation from leading suppliers of this type of instrumentation and found that none of them meet our needs to measure this type of cloud spectram. The instrumentation is cutting edge technology and is limited to the research cloud physics community. Presently, there is no other instrumentation available that has the same capabilities of this instrumentation. The instrument also fits into standard PMS particle probe canister which NASA GRC owns and has mounting approved and flight tested for NASA GRC icing research aircraft, so no additional manpower or fabrication support will be required for installation and flight testing. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 7, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Conifer tree climbing and conifer cone collection:

The purpose of this solicitation is to secure services for conifer tree climbing and conifer cone collection on the Umatilla National Forest.  The Schedule of Items relfects the total tree climbing and cone colletion needs for all four ranger districts located on the Umatilla National Forest.  On the north end the Pomeroy Ranger District with office in Pomeroy, Washington and the Walla Walla Ranger District with office located in Walla Walla, Washington.  On the south end the Heppner Ranger District with office located in Heppner, Oregon and the North Fork John Day Ranger District with office located in Ukiah, Oregon.

This solicitation will result in a performanced-based, multiple-year, “Requirements” Contract type.  The estimated quantity stated in the schedule reflects the approximate need the Umatilla National Forest anticipates needing during the life of the contract. The estimated quantity is not a representation that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal. Utilization of the “requirements” contract has been determined to be appropriate for acquiring cone collection needs as the Government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities that will be ordered during the contract period. The contract quantities do not include a minimum (guaranteed) obligation on the part of the Government. Task Orders will be issued with actual quantities to the Contractor at the beginning of each cone collection period. The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps on or about June 7, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to use nonparametric source apportionment, a new receptor-oriented model, to locate and quantify sources impacting receptors in St. Louis and up to two other urban areas.  The first objective will be to apply nonparametric source apportionment (Yu et al., 2004; Henry et al., 2002) to monitoring sites in 2 or 3 urban areas to identify and quantify contributions from local sources impacting each monitoring site.  The second objective will be to enhance the nonparametric source apportionment code  used in these applications to include an estimate of uncertainty in the apportionments.  An optional objective is to develop code for estimating and visualizing 3D nonparametric source apportionment.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because Dr. Ronald Henry has the most  extensive experience and expertise in developing and applying nonparametric regression.  Furthermore, other research groups credit Dr. Henry for allowing them to use his modeling tool for their analyses.   NAICS Code 541511 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent  of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested  parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division,  research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

All interested 8(a), HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns will notify this office via email of their intention to submit a proposal on the proposed contract as Prime no later than 5 June 2006.  NOTE:  8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB firms:  This notification/submittal MUST include (1) Name, address, and small business size status of the firm; (2) past performance references; evidence of contracts of similar size and complexity, qualifications (construction costs between $500,000 and $1,000,000); The project information shall include, at a minimum, the following information:  (i) the contract name or number, completion date of the project, and the total cost of the project; (ii) the names and telephone numbers of the facility or installation for whom the work was performed; (iii) the name and telephone number of a supervisory level point of contact at each facility or installation who has knowledge of the performance of the entity or entities.

If adequate interest is not received from 8(a), HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns, then the requirement will be issued unrestricted.  In addition, if adequate interest is received from 8(a) HUB Zone or SDVOSB concerns, it is the Contracting Officer's determination on how the project will be set-aside in accordance with applicable procedures.

This project will replace the existing 1959 vintage 15 kV three phase switching station #1 with modern 15 kV switchgear in a protective enclosure.  The new switching station switchgear lineup will consist of three circuit breakers for circuits B, C, and D with one spare circuit breaker and one spare space for future growth.  The enclosure will protect the equipment from exposure to the salt water/air and protect maintenance personnel when performing circuit breaker maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  The new 15 kV circuit breakers will have microprocessor controlled protective relaying functions to properly coordinate the power distribution system at this location.  There will be a SCADA-type control system provided to control the functions of the circuit breakers and protective relaying for this switching station.  The control station will be located at the control room of Building 160.  There will be pole line work associated with installation of the new switching station to re-connect the existing circuits fed from the switchgear and to allow circuits to be bypassed during switchgear maintenance procedures.  The new switching station enclosure will be raised to above current flood elevations in that area (13.25 feet above sea level) by construction of a masonry platform with stairway access.  The new elevation of the switchgear will be 14.25 feet above sea level.  The existing truck access for the fuel tanks in this area will be re-graded and repaired to allow access around the new switching station.  Grass sod will be placed in the disturbed area around the new switching station to prevent erosion in this area.  NAICS is 237130:  POWER AND COMMUNICATION LINE AND RELATED STRUCTURES CONSTRUCTION with a size standard of $31 million.  All interested 8(a) Set-aside, HUBZone and SDVOSB concerns will notify this office via email at jodeen.cuffe@navy.mil no later than 5 June 2006.  YOUR RESPONSE MUST include the requirements (1) through (3) listed herein.   TELEPHONE NUMBER CITED FOR JODEEN CUFFE IS CHANGED TO READ 843-228-8563.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the contact information. Robert Julia is the primary contact point and Fred Ettehadieh is the secondary contact. There are no further changes to the original text, as follows: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a noncompetitive basis to University of Houston to develop anatomical high-resolution models of an adult and a child. The models will be generated from scans of MR images using the novel Total Imaging Matrix (TIM) system from Siemens. Once the MRI images are obtained, the different organ and tissue regions on the MR images will be identified by an expert team of physicians and biologists with the help of semi-automated software. Based on these data, three-dimensional Computer Aided Design (CAD) models will be generated using interpolation techniques to avoid the staircased transition between the MR images. The final models will consist of multiple CAD objects with smooth surfaces. These models will be used by FDA scientists, using software currently available to them, to calculate the effects of various radiological exposures to specific parts of the human body. A crucial part of this work is to perform MR images segmentation and develop CAD model using the Amira 4.0 software package. The contractor will lead two graduate students working with physicians to develop such CAD models. They will also import these models directly into electromagnetic simulation software packages and perform preliminary electromagnetic dosimetry simulation to test the developed models. The selected group at University of Houston has extensive experience in developing human subject CAD models for electromagnetic related dosimetry research. This is not a request for quotes; however, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency. FDA intends to make an award fifteen (15) days following the date of this notice. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

POC Marcia Goldman, Contract Specialist, 301-496-2302

DESC: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Science Education (OSE) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8 (a) firms to develop a curriculum supplement on bioethics for high school general biology classes. The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS code 61170 with a size standard of $6.5 million

The offeror will develop a curriculum supplement for high school general biology classes on the ethical issues surrounding selected biomedical practices, such as clinical research, genetic screening, and vaccinations. The supplement will be a teacher’s guide consisting of 1) detailed instructions on conducting five classroom lessons, 2) masters for copying student worksheets and other paper-based resources used during the lessons, 3) a teacher’s section on the scientific and ethical content, 4) a section detailing the pedagogical design of the lessons, 5) a section aligning the lessons to the National Science Education Standards (see www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses), 6) a section discussing how the lessons fit into common high school general biology curricula, and 7) a list of relevant references and resources.
 
The offerer will be required to 1) use the National Science Education Standards in designing and developing the supplement; 2) interact with NIH staff frequently throughout the contract period; 3) field test the lessons in schools that represent the intellectual and diversity spectrum found in secondary schools across the nation (test sites must include, but shall not be limited to, a high school in the Washington DC metropolitan area); 4) develop a Web site to house PDF and HTML versions of the supplement including any multimedia components of the student lessons; and 5) provide a formatted copy of the final curriculum supplement in InDesign or Quark Express format including all linked images (as gray scale or cmyk, depending on how the image should print) ready for professional printing. 

NIH intends for the curriculum supplement to be freely reproduced for classroom use and to be freely distributed to educators across the nation. NIH does not intend for the materials to be used by any organization for sale or profit. 

This supplement will enrich existing curricular materials, assist high school biology teachers in attaining their educational goals, and engage students in developing critical and ethical thinking skills. Students will gain an understanding of specific biomedical practices by engaging in the lessons within the supplement. They will identify and study the ethical issues that arise as these practices are implemented in society. Students will then examine their own values and beliefs, come to a conclusion that fits within these values and beliefs, and articulate and justify their position on the ethical issues surrounding the biomedical practices.

The core of the supplement will be five stand-alone lessons, each taking one or two 45-minute class periods to complete. These lessons should be designed so that they are easily integrated into the topics commonly studied in general biology classes in high schools nationwide. Laboratory and computer-based activities may be used when they will enhance the students’ learning experience. However, all computer-based activities must have a paper-and-pencil alternative. The supplement’s design must be consistent with other NIH curriculum supplements (see science.education.nih.gov/supplements).

All materials developed for the curriculum supplement must be in two formats: print and Web ready. All multimedia must be Web ready and operable using Apple’s Safari and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer Web browsers in Macintosh and Windows platforms. IBM Domino/Notes is OSE’s primary Web server and the application for internal collaborative tasks.  All Web development work by the offeror must run under Domino/Notes 7.0 CF (or above). Any database constructed for a student lesson must be designed using Lotus Notes. All Web pages must be in accordance with Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (1998). Each Web page of the final product must conform to the NIH Curriculum Supplement Series Web Style Guide (see science.education.nih.gov/supplements/styleguide). 

The offeror must be a nationally recognized curriculum development organization with experience in producing high-quality, field-tested life science curricula for grades 9 - 12 that are currently being used in schools nationwide. The offeror must present a team with the following expertise: 1) life science curriculum developers and educators who have been successful in teaching a diverse range of students; 2) technical writers who are knowledgeable about biomedical issues; 3) specialists in state-of-the-art educational technologies; 4) scientists with experience in biomedical practices, biotechnology and bioethics; and 5) Web developers/Multimedia specialists with proven experience working with IBM Domino/Notes and designing Section 508-compliant Web pages. 

The offerer will design the supplement using a research-based, student-centered approach to instruction. The educational design philosophy of the supplement should be consistent with the National Science Education Standards and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy (see www.project2061.org/publications/bsl). The Standards and Benchmarks apply to all students, regardless of age, gender, cultural or ethnic background, disabilities, aspirations, or interest and motivation in science. The supplement should emphasize how basic and clinical research contributes to our knowledge of diseases and leads to advances in health care. It should also illustrate the multiplicity of approaches to solving problems on scientific and bioethical issues. The lessons should provide students with opportunities to understand basic, clinical, and bioethical research. They should be dynamic, engaging, and relevant to high school students. The offeror will indicate how the lessons will be tested and evaluated to assess their effectiveness in meeting the learning objectives. The offeror and OSE will meet frequently throughout the entire contract period to ensure that the supplement is scientifically accurate and that the lessons provide creative learning experiences applicable to all students nationwide. The offerer will present mechanisms for ensuring scientific accuracy using their own experts and include a plan for interacting with NIH scientists for content review. The offeror will also provide realistic time lines for development of the supplement and show thoughtful consideration for the needs of teachers with diverse student populations. 

NIH intends to negotiate a multi-year contract for a period of two years. Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information. Any major proposed collaborations between the offerer and other entities must have been established prior to this survey and proven effective in producing high-quality science curricula that are currently being used in schools nationwide. If significant collaboration and subcontracting is anticipated to deliver technical capability, the offeror must show that they possess the administrative and management infrastructure to maintain full-time technical and managerial control of the project. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of a capability statement to the address above within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date this notice appears. Each firm must provide samples of curricular products they designed and developed that are currently being used in the classroom. Firms should also include executive summaries of field tests or formal evaluations conducted for these materials. This market survey is being conducted through the Federal Business Opportunity Web site (see www.fedbizopps.gov) to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.

A “roll-over” system incorporating both a shampoo and a wax cycle, with the ability to selectively turn off the wax cycle, and needs to be completely automated with sensors used for the opening and closing of the bay doors on the entrance and exit, and operated by a touchpad at the entrance with pushbutton heights for both high vehicles as well as standard height vehicles.  Unit needs to be made from a stainless steel construction with other steel parts being coated in a galvanized coating.  Washing system will need to be able to wash all forms of vehicles from a small sedan to a tractor-trailer combination exceeding 13 feet in height, and have a two-stage washing program for washing vehicles that are longer than the building.  System will also need a blower system and the unit must be able to operate in EXTREME winter conditions (to 70 below F).  System would have to include a comprehensive warranty, and the installation cost would have to include the removal of the existing system, with the existing system being retained by the customer.  Construction of the wash rack will have to be of a “Heavy-Duty” or industrial construction and be able to handle a high volume of traffic.  The Government will furnish the washbay/building, water, and electrical power.

<CONTACT>Emma Rena, Contract Specialist, Phone 315/330-7116, Fax 315/330-8002, Email Emma.Rena@rl.af.mil
<DESC>Description.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site (RSS) is seeking capable small business sources to perform research and development activities in the area of Information Fusion and Understanding. The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory, RRS, defines Information Fusion and Understanding (IFU) as a continuous process that provides world-wide situational awareness in order to enable decision superiority.  In the broadest sense it consists of combining information to estimate or predict the state of some aspect of the universe.  The IFU process is further characterized by a continuous refinement of estimates and assessments, and by the evaluation of the need for additional sources, or modifications of the process itself, to achieve improved results. This effort supports modern military and homeland security operations by developing revolutionary decision-aiding capabilities to capture, manage, exploit, reason, and combine/fuse critical time sensitive information from a variety of sources. 

The scope of this effort consists of research, development, integration, testing, demonstration, fielding, and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) for new and innovative technologies and concepts to enable a continuous assessment of global conditions and events. This innovative technology will be applied to assemble actionable information from multiple data sources in order to establish and maintain battle space situational awareness and understanding.  This includes an understanding of adversarial capabilities and intent and the ability to locate, identify, track, and observe/monitor all friendly, enemy, non-friendly, and nonaligned forces/ actors anywhere/anytime in near real-time.


Specifically this effort will investigate technological approaches to help achieve a heighten state of shared situational awareness, understanding and knowledge among all elements of a Joint force, in conjunction with Allied and coalition partners.  The goal is to employ new innovative technology concepts to help achieve situational dominance and dramatically increase survivability, lethality, speed, timeliness, and responsiveness. Innovative fusion technologies and capabilities will be developed and delivered using multiple strategic, tactical, and intelligence sources to identify and overcome critical weaknesses, and enable the warfighter to proactively anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess any target, any where, at any time.  New approaches, techniques, and the development of software tools will be accomplished to provided adaptive multi-platform, multi-level, multi-intelligence reasoning and fusion systems to support the needs of today's warfighter. 

New and novel approaches will be researched to permit the aggregation of data from multiple sources to support reasoning, visualization, and collaboration within the battle space of special area of interest. Advanced multi-intelligence, multi-level data fusion architectures will be investigated and applied for network-based dynamic distributed systems or conventional standalone centralized systems. Architectures will be based on open standards to provide plug and play capability. The fusion architectures will be developed to provide the ability to support multiple fusion algorithms and an adaptive information fusion management process.  This effort will also explore innovative technologies and concepts to enable situation assessment and impact assessment, also referred to as higher levels of fusion.  These higher levels of fusion consider object and event grouping, associations, and trends across space and time.  Concepts will be developed to consider the dynamics of semantic information networks, sculpted by associative learning laws in conjunction with existing knowledge sub-nets and human-in-the-loop guidance.  Complementary approaches involving genetic, statistical, model-based, and rule-based methods will be applied to create an information fusion system that addresses the needs of the decision maker.

Research and Development of Knowledge Discovery technologies will be investigated to enable the realization of computationally intelligent systems for predictive situational awareness, complex reasoning, and situation understanding. This effort will help provide an integrated suite of tools and techniques to empower the warfighter, from the Commander down to each combatant, with a comprehensive knowledge of the battle space in support of their decision-making process.  Techniques for retrieval, extraction, authoring and management of information will be investigated. Innovative techniques and processes that push the envelope of performance of reasoning engines, in terms of the scale of the problems that can be dealt with and the speed and correctness of reasoning will also be studied.  Novel methods that extend the breath of reasoning to deal with uncertain and dynamic environments where the knowledge base is characterized by uncertain and temporally changing information beliefs about the environment will be considered. Approaches for discovering relevant linkages between entities, reasoning about different levels of abstraction, classifying the emerging and suspected instances of patterns of interest, and reasoning with multiple hypotheses and with uncertainty will be researched.  Techniques will be developed to enable computational systems the ability to reason explicitly about what it knows, what it doesn't know, and what it needs to know in order to learn.

Finally this effort will support an environment for the integration of the Information Fusion and Understanding technology for the purposes of functional assessment, performance testing, evaluation, transition, and fielded support to operational units.  

Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide Information Fusion and Understanding technical support to existing customers and to new customer sites after transition.  In the course of performance, the support personnel will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide.  Personnel will also provide technical effort to AFRL/IFE to assist in the analysis, design, research and development, integration, testing, and evaluation.  Anticipated deliverables include software, technical documentation, and training.

A Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) – Completion type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of sixty (60) months.  Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  Multiple Awards are anticipated.  The maximum contemplated ordering amount for all awards is a total of $49,900,000.  The prime contractor and/or system integrators for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances at the time of the award.

Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside.  Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 250 each Sensor, Limit, Magnet, Honeywell P/N 121XK21-2, DMD Systems Recovery, Inc. P/N DMD0623-2; ASN:  R400-2A1A1S5-2. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS)/NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO.  The proximity sensor originally manufactured by Honeywell (P/N 121XK21-2), is no longer commercially available and a suitable replacement is required.  The NWS/Radar Operations Center (ROC) and the NEXRAD Pedestal designer, DRS Surveillance Support Systems conducted an extensive market research for a suitable replacement Honeywell part but no replacement was found.  The research determined that all modern proximity designs require an operating voltage in the 10-30 volt range. The WSR-88D antenna/pedestal is designed for a proximity switch that requires an operating voltage of +5 volts, +/-0.25 volts. Specific Technical Features: Barrel Size, Barrel Length, and Operating Voltage, Operating Point, Release Point, and Operating Temperature Range are all technical features that must be adhered to in order to be compatible with use in the NEXRAD Pedestal. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire from only one qualified source DMD Systems Recovery, Inc. under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).  The government knows of only one qualified source authorized to provide the items referenced.  DMD holds proprietary drawings for a part equivalent to the Honeywell sensor referenced herein.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.  The government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to DMD Systems Recovery, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the government without further notice.

<SUBJECT>--Short-Range Missile Defense with Optimized Radar Distribution (SWORD) Interferometric Radar Validation Program (IRVP)
<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Technovative Applications (TA), Brea, California, for an increase to the ceiling on the current TA Contract DASG60-00-C-0091.  The proposed action is pursu ant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support continuation of current efforts relating to modifications to the existing TA Precision Tracking System (PTS) radars and operations and  maintenance of these radars at national test ranges.  Upgraded PTS radars will be required for operations in the August 2006 timeframe.  Award to any source other than TA would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This action will be a mo dification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned through 30 September 2007.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cos t savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward Technovative Applications.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dian ne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solic it and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract DASG60-00-C-0091 is not a request for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>65--Paclitaxel-eluting stents
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VISN 6 Centralized Acquisition Service, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Boston Scientific for the purchase of TAXUS stents. This proposed contract action is for TAXUS stents for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 603.2. The VA believes that Boston Scientific is the only company that can provide, paclitaxel-eluting stents. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 7 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements for paclitaxel-eluting stents. Information may be sent to the Contracting Office, VA Medical Center, Hampton, Virginia. 23667. Responses received will be evaluated however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Boston Scientific.

Woodstraw Mulch Procurement  05/22/2006

This request is for purchase of 500 tons of woodstraw mulch material that is to be used for fire rehabilitation projects as well as road construction and watershed improvement projects.  Woodstraw mulch is a wood based erosion control material that performs or exceeds the erosion control capability of wheat or rice straw.  It is manufactured directly from harvested trees or from byproducts of the wood products industry.  The woodstraw mulch will be used for both ground and aerially applications to prevent erosion and lessen recovery time of land areas disturbed though land management practices and/or natural wildfires.

The woodstraw mulch material must be of the following specifications.

1.  All material must come from weed free wood strands that are of 4-6mm in width and of various lengths of 60-240 mm.  The thickness of the wood strands must be 2-4mm in thickness.  Each bale should consist of no more than 50% of any single length by weight
2.  The wood strands must be made from non-bark material and must be manufactured from materials that are visually inspected to be free of known insect and disease that could be transported to other locations.
3.  The wood strands must be baled into 40-60 lb (small) and 600-1000 lb (large) bales in the quantities specified.
4.  All bales must be held together by wire or synthetic twine.
5.  Bales must be stored in a covered location and must remain dry throughout the period of production until delivery or acquisition to the USFS.  Stacked bales must be allowed to have air circulate to allow moisture contents to decrease.   Moisture content at time of production is 40% (wet weight basis) or less.
6.  A minimum of 1/10 of the total quantity requested must be delivered by June 8, 2006.  The remaining quantity must be delivered by September 1, 2006.  
7.  Certifications of actual baled weight produced must be provided by the contractor to the USFS .  Final certification will be the responsibility of the Forest Service before the product is accepted.  Final certification will include a random sampling of large and small bales.  The sampling will test for moisture content, weight of bales, transport ability (twine and compaction), and size of wood strands.
Bales must be within the following specifications to be acceptable.
	a.  Moisture content less than 40%.
	b.  Baled weight of small bales 40-60 lbs, large bales 600-1000 lbs.
	c.  Bales must not fall apart when moved by twine (small bales) or bale squeeze lift. 
	d.  Wood strands are 60-240 mm with no more than 60% any one length.  Specifications require no more than 50% .  by weight. The extra 10% allows for variances than may occur with estimating the total strand size distribution.
8.  A minimum of 25 tons but not to exceed 35 tons of small 50lb bales are to be delivered first to:		
		Krassel Ranger District, 500 North Mission Street McCall, ID 83638
			Contacts:  Dean Martens (208-634-0794 or 208-634-6949)
				    Tom Crawford (208-634-0619)

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this procurement is unrestricted and any interested contractors may submit a quote. 

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA - MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM (ICP-MS) to be used in the Analytical Chemistry Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

***NIST intends to use the ICP-MS for SRM certification measurements.  Based on the SRMs produced by NIST and the forward looking assessment of industrial needs for new SRMs, the new ICP-MS must be capable of measuring sub nanograms per gram levels of elements (excluding halogens, carbon, sulfur, and gaseous elements) from mass 2 to mass 238.  The sources of these SRMs include environmental, agriculture, nutritional, biological, clinical, metallurgical, and geological materials.  The matrix of these SRMs ranges from simple rainwater, to low salt biological tissues and fluids, to high salt soil, sediment, ores, and alloys.  Due to the wide variety of samples to be measured by this instrument, it is highly likely that an analyte element of a current project happens to be the principle matrix element of the previous project.  To ensure the one analytical measurement project does not adversely affect the next due to a rule change of an element from the matrix to the analyte, the new ICP-MS must be free from memory effect.  

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  Line Item 0001 - The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA - MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from potential offerors.

Question 1. Specification paragraph 2.1.1 calls for a Single mission (one modulation and data rate) receiver but then goes on to specify tunable from 75-400 Mbps.  Will the receiver be used in a fixed frequency and fixed data rate application or will it be a multi-mission environment with changing frequencies and changing data rates? 
 
ANSWER 1. We expect to use it initially with one frequency/data rate. But we would like the flexibility to use other frequencies/data rates at a later time. The details of the future use are unknown at this time.
 
QUESTION 2. Specification paragraph 2.1.1 calls for the receiver to have an LVDS digital output.  Specification Paragraph 2.2.2 calls for the telemetry processor to have an ECL input/output.  Please clarify which electrical signaling is required.
 
ANSWER 2. The High Data Rate Receiver shall also have a differential ECL interface.
QUESTION 3.  Specification paragraph 2.2, 3rd sentence specifies Rice Decompression without any other information elaborating on the use of Rice decompression.  Also, Figure 1 does not indicate Rice Decompression.  Please clarify the use of the Rice Decompression in the system.
ANSWER 3. Rice decompression will be per CCSDS 121.0-B-1. It would be optional processing off of the VC demux and before Frame Encapsulation. 
 
QUESTION 4.  Are the physical size requirements (Specification paragraph 2.1.8 and 2.2.6) a maximum size allowed?
 
ANSWER 4. Yes.
 
QUESTIONS 5.  Based on the number of disks specified in Specification paragraph 2.3, we are assuming RAID-1 (mirror).  Are other RAID configurations (e.g., RAID-5) acceptable?  Also, what is the protocol for the Network Attached Storage (e.g., NFS, CISF, SAMBA, others)? 
 
ANSWER 5. Either RAID-1 or RAID-5 is acceptable. The NAS should be compatible with the Telemetry Processing System and if possible, use a non-proprietary interface protocol. Use of a non-proprietary interface is highly preferable.
 
 
QUESTION 6. The Specification does not call for Design Reviews, Customer Approved Factory Acceptance Tests, etc; are any of these activities required with the delivery?  If so, can they be described in more detail?
 
ANSWER 6. We are assuming a COTS product. We will test the equipment within our existing system before final acceptance. It is anticipated that arrangements can be made for the provider to attend these tests.
 
QUESTION 7. Is this a new requirement? If not who was the incumbent?
 
ANSWER 7. This is a new requirement for an upgrade to our current system. It will be used as part of NRL's Blossom Point Satellite Ground Station.

QUESTION 8. Is there a technical representative for this procurement?

ANSWER 8. Yes; the technical representative will be identified at time of award.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR RHENIUM BAR STOCK.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received since posting. The due date for responses is extended to May 26, 2006. The following question and answer is provided in response to questions asked: Question:  Do you require a full chemistry or only a certification of composition?  Per the request for physical and mechanical properties, do you require the material to meet the Young’s modulus of 280-390MPa, Shear Modulus of 1300-1390MPa, and Poisson’s ratio of 0.285?	To provide real Shear and Poisson’s ratio, Torsion testing would be required. The shear and Poisson’s ratio can be roughly calculated from room temperature strength with poor precision.  Do you require yield strength at room and high temperature testing and elongation at high temperature?  What tensile test bar configuration is required? Answer:  A certificate of composition is acceptable.  The mechanical properties in the solicitation are intended to be nominal, expected properties consistent with the product form and heat treat, not minimum design properties for our application.  We are not asking for the supplier to test the material, but to respond with a product they produce in these ranges.  If the company does not offer a product that they feel is consistent with these properties, we will consider their closest suggested alternative. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 4:30 P.M. CDST, May 26, 2006. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 26, 2006.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the contact information to show Robert Julia as the primary contact and Fred Ettehadieh as the secondary contact.  There are no further changes to the text below.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, a simplified acquisition under FAR part 13 and a total small business set-aside. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) is investigating in vitro characterization of Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) as a component in the demonstration of their bioequivalence. A set of in vitro tests would be used as part of the determination of product equivalence. These include the emitted dose evaluated at different flow rates and the particle size (measured by cascade impactor) produced at different flow rates for development of a product with potentially different ratios of carrier to drug from those found in the reference product. The purpose is to evaluate the proposed in vitro equivalence tests for DPIs to identify the sensitivity to differences in product formulations; evaluate the variability to be expected in the in vitro tests; and investigate the extent to which the device can be changed to counteract differences in formulation and provide equivalent in vitro performance. In this project, products with known differences (which should include ratios of drug substance (DS) to carrier, particle size (carrier or DS), surface roughness, and different manufacturing steps) would be manufactured and then tested at multiple flow rates for emitted dose and for particle size by cascade impactor. Monthly progress reports will be required. At the completion of the project, a report analyzing the results of the study shall be provided to the FDA. In addition, all of the raw data from the experiments shall be provided to the FDA. Offerors shall submit technical proposals to demonstrate their ability to perform the work. Offerors shall propose 1 or 2 model drugs to be studied and shall justify these selections for generalizability. Technical merit will be assessed on the following factors: 50% Qualification of the PI as assessed by education, publications, and previous research projects relevant to the project; 25% Quality of the facilities required including laboratory space and analytical instrumentation; and 25% Quality of the proposal as assessed by its ability to meet the requirements set forth above. A separate pricing proposal must be submitted itemizing projected costs required to complete the work. Cost realism will be analyzed to determine the offeror’s understanding of the requirement as well as to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. A firm fixed price award is anticipated, with a monthly payment schedule corresponding to the offeror’s anticipated monthly costs or cash flow or corresponding to progress achieved, except that not less than 5 percent of the negotiated price shall be withheld pending acceptance of the final report and all raw data. Payment of monthly invoices will depend on acceptance by the Project Officer of the monthly progress report. This is a best buy acquisition in which technical factors are significantly more important than all other factors including price and past performance. Award will be made using SF1447 as a bilateral purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; all relevant required clauses will apply. FAR clause 52.212-1 at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/current/html/52_212_213.html shall be included as well as 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items and 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items. Proposals must be submitted in electronic form to Robert.Julia@fda.hhs.gov. Hardcopy proposals will be accepted at the contracting office address set forth above, marked for Robert Julia, but electronic versions of all documents must be provided unless physically impossible (drawings or designs that cannot be created electronically or scanned). Proposals are due not later than 4:30pm Wednesday June 14, 2006. Questions concerning this acquisition should be submitted by email to Mr. Julia within ten days following this announcement; answers will be provided as an amendment to this combined synopsis/solicitation.
