The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC><p>Contracting Office Address<br /><br />Department of the Air Force, Air Mobility Command, 437th CONS, 101 E. Hill Blvd, Charleston AFB. SC, 29404-5021.<br /><br />//NOTICE TO OFFERORS; FUNDS ARE NOT PRESENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. NO AWARD WILL BE MADE UNDER THIS SOLICITATION UNTIL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS SOLICITATION/RFP EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE BID OPENING/RFP CLOSING DATE. //
<p>Repair 437th Air Wing Headquarters - Bldg 16000: Dollar magnitude for this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The performance period for this project is 479 calendar days. The work required will consist of renovating Building 16000. The scope of this project is to finalize the 90% design to 100% completion and to completely implement the final design solution. Building 16,000 will remain partially occupied during construction. Part of the Design/Build contractor's responsibilities will be to complete development and update the current phasing plan provided in the 90% drawings. The current phasing plan includes three phases. The 1st Phase requires the user to vacate the entire 2nd floor for construction. Construction of the 1st floor will require two phases. Upon completion of the 1st phase (2nd floor), users located in 2nd phase area will move into the completed 2nd floor. After completion of the 2nd phase, users will move to other areas in the building and the remaining 1st floor areas will be renovated as Phase 3. Contractor is required to maintain operational, all utilities for occupied areas of the facility, including HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing, Fire Protection, Communications, etc. The Contractor is responsible to minimize disruption and impact on the occupied areas of the facility. Provide for safety of occupants. Provide barriers that reasonably limit occupied space contamination of dust, noise, pollutants, etc. Maintain separation of work areas from occupied areas. Contractor shall provide temporary exterior stairways for worker &amp; materials access and egress from the second floor of the facility. The existing interior stairways shall only be used by Contractor personnel for emergency egress. Provide a Work Flow Plan in all phases to minimize impact to occupants working in the facility and to separate occupant access from construction worker access; removal and disposal of construction debris; as well as access for new materials. Ensure that vertical routing of utility (and other) work items between floors are considered and accommodated in all phases. Phasing shall be developed to minimize disruption of command activities, with consideration to utility outages, occupant relocation, installation of barriers to reduce dust, noise, etc. Work must be properly planned, coordinated; and users shall be properly notified prior to initiation of potentially disruptive work. Contractor's Phasing Plan shall consider timing of user relocation, but the actual relocation of occupants, furnishings, and room contents will be performed by the government. Development of the final phasing plan will require coordination with the Contracting Officer, Users and various CAFB and CE personnel. The current 90% design includes complete and separate Society of Interior Designers (SID) and Council of Interior Design (CID) packages, including modular furniture packages for all affected areas of the facility. The SID and CID designs are and must be kept completely separate packages, as procurement of the CID package will be a separately funded follow-on project. Interior finishes and furnishings in this design reflect a level of quality expected in a command headquarters. Minimal design update work to both the SID and CID is expected. The responsibility of the contractor in this project is to update the design of both the SID and CID packages only as necessary to accommodate other design updates. In regard to construction, the SID work is included in this project, and the CID construction work is not included.</p>
<p><br />All labor, vehicles, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other furnished property and services except as specified in the contract as Government furnished property will be provided by the contractor. A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated. SDVOSB and HUB Zone firms will first be sought by individual group. If a response from two or more qualified firms is received for any of the two categories, this requirement will be set-aside. Should an insufficient number of responses be received in the two categories, the requirement will be issued as a Small Business Set-Aside. Interested SDVOSB and HUB Zone concerns should indicate interest to the Contracting Officer, in writing as early as possible, but not later than 9 July 2008.</p>
<p>AS A MINIMUM, THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS REQUIRED:</p>
<p>(a) A copy of your letter from the VA certifying your status as a SDV or a copy of the certificate issued by SBA of your qualifications as a HUB Zone concerns.</p>
<p>(b) A positive statement of you intention to bid on this contract as a prime contractor;</p>
<p>(c) Evidence of recent Design/Build experience in work similar in type and scope to included contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contract with current telephone numbers and percent and description of work self-performed;</p>
<p>(d) Evidence of bonding capability to the maximum magnitude of the project to include both single and aggregate totals.</p>
<p>All of the above information must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested SDVOSB or HUB Zone concerns. Failure to submit all information requested may result in a contractor not being considered as an interested SDVOSB or HUB Zone concerns. If adequate interest is not received from SDVOSB and HUB Zone concerns, the solicitation will be issued as a Small Business Set-Aside without further notice. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31,000,000. The successful contractor will be selected using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with technical factors, resulting in the Best Value to the Government. The technical factors will include a preliminary Work Flow Plan/preliminary Work Schedule. Evaluation of the preliminary Work Flow Plan and preliminary Work Schedule will be placed in the categories of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable or Unacceptable. The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price. Evaluation factors will be set forth in Sections L &amp; M of the solicitation. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 15 July 2008 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fbo.gov. Paper copies will not be available.

<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Bee Robotics LTDS in Gwynedd United Kingdom. CDC Human Papillomavirus program is routinely pursuing HPV genotyping assays with the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Kit (Roche Applied Science). This assay has been proven very reliable and sensitive and has become a core of many epidemiological population studies. The current manual process is quite labor intensive and has met the maximum capacity of the available recourses. The demand for automation and increased throughput is eminent. The BeeBlot instrument from Bee Robotics Ltd. automates temperature controlled washing and hybridization steps of strip-based assays like the HPV Genotyping kit. It allows simultaneous processing of 48 samples with minimal labor input and a greater degree of standardization and reproducibility. The BeeBlot meets all technical specifications to directly adapt Roche's HVP genotyping assay and has in fact successfully been evaluated in our laboratory. <br /><br />Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services. The information recveived in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Please send your documentation to Rafael Aviles at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2668 or email to fyr2@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the government.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be one (1) year from date of award.</p>

As the leader in cancer prevention and control initiatives in Puerto Rico, the CCCUPR through the Puerto Rico Cancer Center has demonstrated a history of successful partnerships with the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Using the existing Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System infrastructure, the CCCUPR is uniquely positioned to conduct this research. The unique aim of this research is to expand surveillance reach to a larger Hispanic population coupled with expertise in cancer prevention and control and infrastructure for conducting surveillance research.  The aforementioned items make the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Puerto Rico uniquely qualified to perform this statement of work.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP), plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding CCOP sustainability with the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 104 Airport Dr., CB 1350, Chapel Hill, NC 27599.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.501 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for one twelve (12) month base year period with one six (6) month option period.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) is a national program that conducts state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials in community settings. The CCOP is a three-way partnership involving the NCI's Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), cancer centers and clinical cooperative groups (known as CCOP Research Bases), and local networks of community hospitals and physicians (know as CCOPS or Minority-Based CCOPS). NCI provides overall direction and funding; CCOP research bases design and conduct the clinical trials; and CCOPS accrue patients, collect data, and disseminate study findings. One third of patient accrual to NCI-sponsored Phase III clinical trials is attributed to the CCOP Program.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to support a longitudinal analysis of all CCOP organizations active from 1991 through 2007 to investigate and evaluate the following questions:  (a) how do organizational factors like CCOP size and geographic reach affect CCOP survival and performance; (b) how do network factors like the number and types of clinical trials available and the number and strength of CCOP ties to research bases affect CCOP survival and performance; and (c) how do local environmental factors like provider competition and market consolidation affect CCOP survival and performance.</p>
<p>In order to complete this analysis in the timeframe stated in this contract, the contractor must have extensive understanding of the CCOP Program and the issues that community physicians face in the implementation of clinical trials in their practice.  Dr. William Carpenter with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill is uniquely qualified to complete this project. As the Principal Investigator for this project, he has been involved in two of the previous CCOP evaluations, one of which focused on organizational adaptation.  This work has given them insight into the complexity of the Program, and its associated data.  This framework is critical to the carrying out the current project, especially considering the time-frame.  Dr. Carpenter will be working with other investigators within the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Several in-depth evaluations of the CCOP Program over the past two decades have been conducted by the Cecil G. Sheps Center.  These prior working relationships will eliminate the need for extensive background research on the CCOPS, which would otherwise substantially increase the overall project costs</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on July 7, 2008.  For further information please contact Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, CB 3270, Davie Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3270  to provide statistical support for projects within the Social Network Methods Section of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).

General Description
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), The Social Network Methods Section of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch (SBRB), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) has a need for the services from Dr. Abigail Panter at the University of North Carolina. Dr. Panter’s expertise, along with two graduate students in the PH.D. program in quantitative psychology, will provide statistical support for projects within the Social Network Methods Section.  Dr. Panter and her team will provide basic descriptive analyses of the data and measures used for each analysis, as well report overall trends and the research by utilizing HLM and Growth Curve Models.

Statement of Work
In this statistical analyses based upon two proposed papers from two ongoing projects within the section, the first project entitled “The Role of Family History and Culture in Communal Coping Within Mexican American Families”(Protocol# 07-HG-N140) aims to 1) examine whether a family-centered feedback approach encourages communications regarding family risked in the development of strategies to adopt health promoting behaviors within the household, 2) investigate whether the type of personalized risk feedback affects family members’ beliefs about the causes and controllability of disease onset and perceived risk of disease, 3) investigate whether shared perceptions of risk and  beliefs about disease mediates the relationship between communications about family risk and the development of cooperative strategies to adopt health promoting behaviors within the family, and 4) understand how to culture in the familiar social system facilitate or impede communications regarding family health history and risk for disease, and the development of strategies to adopt health promoting behaviors. 

The data obtained from the second project entitled “Psychosocial Aspects of Genetic Testing for HNPCC” will be used to address the following aims:  1) develop and refine statistical models for the partial family networks; 2) explore the relationship between family social structure and participation in genetic counseling and testing, disclosure of test results, communication about hereditary risks, adjustment to risk status, and cancer screening practices; and 3) comprehensively assess the impact of the recurring provision of genetic services within these families on genetic knowledge and risk assessment, attitudes toward genetic testing, depressive symptoms, cancer related distress, worry about cancer, cancer screening and family relationships.

The period of performance is August 14, 2008 through August 13, 2009.  Analyses may not be limited to these two projects during the contract time frame.  

The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2008-164-TMB.

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Dr. Panter has extensively worked in developing research designs and data-analytic strategies for applied health problems. This work has incorporated two complementary protocols; NHGRI Protocol# 05-HG-N249 (Psychosocial Aspects of Genetic Testing for HNPCC) and 95-HG-0165 (Outcomes of Education and Counseling for HNPCC Testing).

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541990 and the associated small business size standard is $ 6.5 Million. 
 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, FL (NSWC-PCD) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to North Star Scientific Corporation of 91-238A Kalaeloa Blvd, Kapolei, HI 86707 for procurement of one (1) each Remote Power Amplifier; 50W for AN/VRC-99B Part Number 03-01-035-00; one (1) each PDL Assembly for AN/VRC-99B Part Number 03-01-036-00; and one (1) each  Remote Radio Box for AN/VRC-99B Part Number 03-03-007-00. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The North Star components are required for use in developing part of Vehicle Data Security Agent (VDSA) and Vehicle Configuration Agent (VCA) in the Advanced MVCS Control Cabinet.  This unit will affect the MVCS project, and will be used in the Advance MPCE Mission Package Development. The Advanced MVCS leverages off the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) MVCS / MPCE that has been already developed and tested.  Since much of the software from the LCS MVCS / MPCE will be ported directly into the Advanced MPCE it is essential that the key components be identical so as to ensure 100% compatibility and operability.  Use of any other components or configurations of equipment would result in costly and time consuming testing to certify the items 100% compatible. NAICS 334220. Size Standard 750 employees. PSC 5820 .  Set aside for small business-100%.  POC: Sharon Hess.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is to publish the intent of a sole source award to Loan Performance (formerly known as Mortgage Information Corporation), Santa Ana, CA. Loan performance is the only known source that can provide sub-prime and jumbo mortgage data to derive modeling efforts and the assessment of risk in both single family and retained portfolio businesses at the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight uses this data to effectively evaluate the GSE loan portfolios and to monitor the attributes and performance of jumbo single-family mortgages. The data must provide loan-level data on the attributes and performance of most single-family loans that are too large to be eligible for Enterprise purchase (so-called "jumbo" loans) and that have been securitized. The database must include information about each mortgage at the time of origination (e.g., original balance, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, borrower credit score, zip code of the property) and at the end of each subsequent month (e.g., payment status, principal balance). The data must support the development of mortgage prepayment, delinquency, and default models. The Loan Performance data is the only known publicly available source on the attributes and performance of jumbo single-family and sub-prime mortgages. It is used throughout the industry and as the basis for modeling. No other known comparable loan-level datasets are available.
<p>NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) IS AVAILABLE. Any other sources capable of providing data that will perform as prescribed above are invited to demonstrate capability by submitting in writing capability statements and other documents that demonstrate capability to provide the above data to claudia.addison@ofheo.gov no later than July 14, 2008, 4:00pm, Eastern daylight savings time. A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research seeks concepts for real time and non-real time automated sensing and understanding of the battle space using multiple distributed unmanned platforms.  This technology should apply to three scenarios of interest 1) at sea battle force area awareness, 2) littoral region of interest, and 3) inland convoy/area force protection.   The proposed products should autonomously formulate platform and surveillance tasking for the purpose of broad area awareness, focus down to areas of interest, identify and persistently hold at risk recognized threats.  The proposed approach would likely include concepts for integration of disparate capabilities including: advanced surveillance, tagging, tracking, identification, autonomous control, communications, automated understanding and display of information encompassed with in an open architecture framework.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) plans to issue sole source extension modifications for the DISN Transmission Services-CONUS Extension (DTS-CE) Contract DCA200-99-D-0050 with AT&T, DTS-CE Contract DCA200-99-D-0051 with Verizon Business (MCI) and DTS-CE Contract DCA200-99-D-0052 with Sprint.  The proposed modifications of the three contracts referenced above are a continuation and extension of the work performed by AT&T, Verizon Business(MCI) and Sprint.  All three contracts were competitively awarded on 23 March 1999.  DISA intends to extend the existing contracts with AT&T, Verizon Business (MCI) and Sprint to allow for the sustainment of services until approximately 2522 circuits can be transitioned off the existing contracts.  These modifications will extend the period of performance of the contracts from 23 March 2009 to 22 March 2010 with two additional one year options.  The DTS-CE contracts provide sub-T1 through OC-N point-to-point transmission services for the Department of Defense and its Services and Agencies and other Federal Departments within the Continental United States.  In addition to transmission services, the DTS-CE contracts provide (as specified by the Government) post, camp, and station wiring to accommodate transmission service delivery to or between any Government identified Service Delivery Point(s) (SDPs).   Contractors must maintain any equipment they installed and provide trouble administration functions to enable users to report problems that effect service, to resolve reported problems, and to determine the status of trouble reports.    The DTS-CE Contractors ensure the protection of the circuits and the network management data transported or contained within the circuits. Network management data includes accounting, configuration, fault, performance, and security management data, service provisioning, and trouble administration. Such information is critical to ensuring the availability of the network and as such, shall require appropriate mechanisms to protect from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

<DESC>ISSUE DATE:  15 JUL 2008.  Request for Proposal (RFP) HSCGG1-08-R-3WK152, DESIGN/BUILD BOAT MAINTENANCE FACILITY, USCG STATION NEW YORK, STATEN ISLAND, NY (ROSEBANK)    

Project consists of Design & Construction of a new Boat Maintenance Facility (BMF) at U.S. Coast Guard Station New York, which is located at Rosebank on Staten Island, NY. The scope of the project is to demolish an existing 1500 sf garage building and construct an approximately 3,000 gsf boat maintenance building. The garage building may contain Lead Based Paint.  Although federal and state regulations do not require removal of LBP prior to demolition, federal regulations do require that demolition waste be tested to determine proper disposal requirements.  The Contractor will be responsible for conducting necessary tests of demolition debris and developing and executing the appropriate disposal plan. At a minimum, the new building spaces shall include 2 boat bays, office, bathroom, storage, machine & engine shop, and mechanical equipment room. Site work includes connections to existing on site utilities including water, sewer, electric, natural gas, and telecommunications.  Additional design and construction criteria for this project shall be included in the Phase II RFP package, including site utilities drawings.  A Design/Build Specification will include Division 1 construction administration requirements, building criteria and design requirements.  The successful offeror must design and construct a complete and usable facility, to be described in the RFP Phase II Documents. 

This solicitation is issued pursuant to FAR Part 15. The estimated price range is between $1,000,000 and $2,500,000. The Congress in authorizing and funding this project has established certain cost limitations for the project.  No award can be made for the design and construction of this project which, with allowances for government imposed contingencies and overhead exceeds the statutory authorization.  Proposals whose price for design and construction exceed the funds available may be rejected.  A construction cost limitation will be provided in the Solicitation.

This procurement shall utilize the Two Phase design-build selection procedures authorized by FAR 36.3.   This process requires potential contractors to submit their past performance, basic technical approach, and capability information initially for review and consideration by the Government.  Following the review, evaluation, and rating of these proposals, the Government intends to select three, but not more than five, of the highest rated contractors to receive a Phase II request for proposal.  Phase II offerors shall provide a technical and cost proposal for consideration by the Government.  Bid guarantees will be required at Phase II.  The Government will review the technical and price proposals of the Phase II offerors.  Evaluations will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 and the evaluation criteria set out in Section M – Evaluation Factors For Award.  Due to the constrained space at the intended building site, engineering ingenuity and creativity by the contractor will be important during the Phase II selection process. All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  

NAICS 236210.  Size Standard is $31.0M.Contract duration is 200 days. This acquisition is 100% set aside for Small Business Concerns.   The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. Approximate issue date is July 15, 2008 and approximate due date for proposals is August 14, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. local time, Warwick, RI. Our office no longer issues solicitation or amendments in paper form.

<DESC>This requirement is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Marine Corps Systems Command has a requirement for All Terrain Vehicle (ATV)  Trailers.

All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  Disclaimer:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).   The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide and sustain an Aerial Fire Fighting Mission Simulator for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).   This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must mark their responses accordingly to ensure proper handling.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.
BACKGROUND:  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) employs a wide variety of aircraft types to be used in the suppression of wildland fires. The unique nature of this work makes it difficult for companies and government aircrew to have relevant prior experience pertinent to aerial suppression of wildland fires. Currently vendors are responsible for most of the aircrew training with additional governmental training being provided via venues such as computer based training (CBT), Aerial Firefighting Institute (AFI), National Aerial Fire Fighting Academy (NAFA). In an effort to comply with the intent of Executive Order 13111,  "Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees" BLM is interested in applying cost effective technologies to train vendor/government flight crew and air crewmembers. On the job training can be effective; however it is costly and involves a degree of risk to aircrews and may jeopardize the success of the mission. The BLM is interested in pursing flight crew and air crewmember training in a simulated wildland fire environment using Flight Training Devices (FTD) or Personal Computer Based Aviation Training Device's (PCATD). We are looking for innovative approaches using cost effective methods that would use commercial off the shelf hardware and software when and if possible.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine offeror interest to provide the BLM with a complete simulated flight training system to include hardware, new or existing software, and contractor logistics support. 
PROGRAM REQUIREMENT:  a)  The flight training system shall be a high-fidelity training system that facilitates flight and air crew training to include part task training, procedural training to teach underlying cognitive principles, mission training and rehearsal in a distributed mission operation training environment.    b)  The flight training system shall be an integrated set of hardware and software that shall implement the performance requirements specified in a requirements document. The training system shall be required to support basic and advanced mission training, tactics validation, air to air and air to ground complex communications to include multiple aircraft in a large fire exercise. c)  The flight training system shall include a Mission Simulator. The Mission Simulator shall be capable of single-ship and/or multi-ship scenario's conducting aerial fire fighting missions.  The flight training system shall include computer generated wildfire simulation, scenario generation capability, instructor-operator stations, and brief-debrief systems.  Specific performance requirements for all system elements shall be defined in a requirements documents.1.  Cockpits.  The simulator system cockpits shall be an accurate representation of (2) Light Turbine Twin engine airplane, (2) Air Tractor AT-802's and (1) Bell 212 or similar Bell medium Helicopter. Each cockpit shall include controls, displays, avionics, and aerodynamic flight modeling representatives of the aircraft. The systems shall provide realistic simulation handling characteristics for all normal ground, flight regimes and retardant operations.  The system shall be equipped with a full field-of-view visual display, digital image generation system for visual cueing system. The four cockpits shall be designed for networked training scenarios of one or more participants and in addition allow for stand-alone, solo pilot training.  Cockpit hardware and software shall be modular and an open architecture design to allow for flexibility for upgrades and incorporation of new hardware/ software technology.  2.

<DESC>The U. S. Customs and Borders Protection (CBP), Office of Information Technology (OIT), Laboratories and Scientific Services (LSS) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding technologies for detection of tunnels and tunneling activities. 

Background:  Customs & Border Protection’s mission is to secure U.S. ports of entry and borders from people and goods that are prohibited or which threaten U.S. citizens, infrastructure, resources and food supply, while efficiently facilitating legitimate trade and travel.  The mission includes interdicting contraband (i.e., drugs, currency, guns, explosives, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and illegal human trafficking.  Clandestine tunnels under our Southern and Northern borders continue to be a problem for counter-smuggling operations.  Historically, a new border tunnel is discovered every 3-6 months. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide CBP with information regarding the availability of an integrated, system of systems approach, detection and exploitation of clandestine tunnels. 

Objective:   
To acquire market information regarding the availability of new and innovative tunnel detection technologies: to locate, rapidly map, determine depth, determine direction and detect tunnel openings.  The technologies sought should be capable of remotely providing forensic information such as shoring, electrical current, piping, etc., within clandestine tunnels.  These data points are desired for CBP and joint CBP, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Local Law Enforcement and Department of Defense (DOD) operations.  Utilizing the system of systems approach to collectively solve the tunnel issues is desired.  All new technology should address the potential for system wide integration.   

Data provided by new systems should be simple to understand by operators and provide as close to real-time reporting as possible.  CBP will need to understand reasons for long reporting periods if real-time reporting is not possible.   The technology sought must  operate in the remote often pervasive environments in which operations occur and account for system durability under less than optimal conditions.  CBP is interested in a range of sensors that can be hand carried, vehicle mounted, or aircraft mounted that are capable of tunnel detection and cuing operators to a tunnel location, opening, or direction.  System integration should account for CBP tunnel sensor system’s data communications and transmissions from remote locations.  

Information on technology performance should include, system capabilities, detection limits, false positive and false negative rates, and stand-off distances.  Also included should be test results (lab and field) and identification of environmental hazards that are to be considered as part of the technology solution.  CBP desires new technology that facilitates minimal operator input through automation, shares data with other systems, includes Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and has simple to understand outputs and displays.  Data displays should be georectified for accuracy or have the ability to be displayed on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with geo-location and depth.  Unattended sensors should be inconspicuous and/or have the ability to be altered to blend in with the environment.  Additionally, unattended sensors should have the option of being self sustaining.  

The main objective is to provide CBP with the early detection of tunneling activity and new tunnel development.  By investigating current and evolving technologies, this RFI is intended to support CBP’s identification of the next generation of tunnel detection equipment, technologies, and systems. 

RFI Submission Requirements:
Please include the following information in your submission: 

(1) Technical Approach:  Describe your COTS tunnel detection technologies and how they can be networked to provide an integrated system of systems approach to tunnel detection and exploitation.  The equipment and system detection limits and conditions must be addressed.  In particular, please describe integration of selected of products, technologies, cost implications. Describe how the technology and systems are deployed and their locations. 

(2) System Configuration:  Please describe the relative advantages and disadvantages of utilizing your solution in a fixed (unattended or maintained), mobile or airborne configuration.  Describe the data acquisition process and data collection requirements to include: speed of data assessment, system configuration, staffing, reliability, system infrastructure requirements, power requirements, life cycle cost and factors required for proper maintenance and long term operation of the system.

(3) Concept of Operation:  Please describe how each system will operate along the Northern and Southern border locations of the U.S.  The description should encompass operations in urban locations, remote locations and discuss relevant environmental constraints.

Under Title 35 U.S.C. § 207(a) each Federal agency is authorized to:  (1) apply for, obtain, and maintain patents or other forms of protection in the United States and in foreign countries on inventions in which the Federal Government owns a right, title, or interest; (2) grant nonexclusive, exclusive, or partially exclusive licenses under federally owned inventions, royalty-free or for royalties or other consideration, and on such terms and conditions, including the grant to the licensee of the right of enforcement pursuant to the provisions of chapter 29 of this title as determined appropriate in the public interest; (3) undertake all other suitable and necessary steps to protect and administer rights to federally owned inventions on behalf of the Federal Government either directly or through contract, including acquiring rights for and administering royalties to the Federal Government in any invention, but only to the extent the party from whom the rights are acquired voluntarily enters into the transaction, to facilitate the licensing of a federally owned invention; and (4) transfer custody and administration, in whole or in part, to another Federal agency, of the right, title, or interest in any federally owned invention.

The NIH Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) is responsible for patent prosecution and licensing for the component institutions of the NIH.  It is the policy of OTT as part of the reporting requirements of license agreements to have audits of license agreements to ensure that licensees are not under reporting sales and the resulting royalties.  Please refer to Chapter No. 308 (Procedures for Auditing NIH Licenses) of the United States Public Health Service Technology Transfer Manual.

The NIAID acting through the OTD and the OTT again requires the professional services of McGladrey & Pullen, certified public accountants to conduct an audit of the sales and financial records related to licensed products of an NIH licensee, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK).  The audit will require at a minimum site visits to two GSK distribution centers in addition to their corporate headquarters or place of business in Rixensart, Belgium.  The distribution centers are to include one in the United States and one in Europe.

McGladrey & Pullen conducted a previous audit of the subject licenses in 2004 and is familiar with the products, services and accounting practices of GSK.  It is expected that certain efficiencies in the preparation, conduct and reporting of their findings will be realized.  Further, the NIAID requires appropriate follow-up to questions concerning discrepant or possible noncompliant findings raised by McGladrey & Pullen in their audit report of 2004.  

Scope of Work

Under Title 35 U.S.C. § 207(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 404.12, and further delimited under the provisions of the subject license agreements by and between the NIH and GSK (Licensee), the NIH shall have the right, at its expense, through a certified public accountant (hereinafter, Contractor) or like person reasonably acceptable to GSK (hereinafter, Licensee), to examine records of all sales of licensed products under the subject licenses granted to determine if OTT received the proper amount of royalty payments specified under their license agreements for use of NIH technologies.  

A Contractor shall conduct an audit of:

NIH Licenses:	L-380-1991  and L-075-1994 
Licensee: 	GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals with Corporate Headquarters or Place of Business in Rixensart, Belgium 
Licensed Products :	Havrix®, Twinrix® and Hepatyrix® 	
Licensed Patents:  	Please Refer to Tables One and Two

The audit shall cover the sales reporting period from 1 January 1996 through 31 December 2007.  

The Contractor shall follow-up and answer questions raised on selected discrepant or possible noncompliant findings from McGladrey & Pullen’s 2004 Audit Report.  The discrepant or possible noncompliant findings are listed in Table Three.

The Licensee withheld royalties after domestic and foreign patents were inadvertently allowed to lapse in 2004 for non-payment of maintenance and annuity fees.  Attempts were made to restore the lapsed patents but were not fully successful.  Contractor shall verify the royalty payments from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007 were proper and correct with respect to payments for said lapsed and restored payments.
 
The Contractor shall review the Licensee’s sales records to test the gross sales figures for all areas where Licensed Products were sold and to verify that the Licensee has accounted for all the Licensed Product sales when reporting net sales and earned royalties due for the period covered by the audit.  Contractor shall perform a detailed calculation of royalties owed on net sales of Licensed Product in accordance with the subject license agreements.  Specifically, using appropriate accounting and auditing procedures, the Contractor shall perform a limited audit that includes at least the following elements:

1.	Compliance Review Preparation:  

	Prior to visiting the Licensee’s place of business to audit sales and financial records, the Contractor, under a confidential nondisclosure agreement, will be provided background information by an OTT Monitoring and Enforcement Specialist (the “Project Officer”).  The NIH Project Officer will prepare and send an audit confirmation letter to the Licensee and assist in coordinating the scheduling of the on-site visits by the Contractor at the Licensee’s place of business and distribution centers.  The Contractor shall determine from the Licensee the type of accounting system and data availability for the period to be audited.  A briefing of the Contractor will be conducted by the Project Officer.  A NIAID observer(s) will be present during the briefing.  A Compliance Review Plan will be formulated by the Contractor as an outcome of this briefing.  Background information provided by the Project Officer to the Contractor will include a copy of the license agreement and any amendments, copies of sales and earned royalty reports submitted by the Licensee for the period to be audited, licensee’s payment history and copies of any other pertinent information about Licensed Products and their sales obtained from other sources.  

2.	Site Visit to the Licensee’s Place of Business:

	Based on the information obtained during the compliance review preparation and briefing, the Contractor shall conduct site visits at selected Licensee location(s) where Licensed Product sales records are kept to conduct the on-site audit and compliance review.  The Compliance Review Plan shall be executed during the site visits.  It is expected that the Contractor will visit two distribution centers in addition to the Licensee’s corporate headquarters or place of business as sales invoices or receipts are not stored at this site.  

	A visit to each distribution center and audit of records is expected to take no more than two (2) to three (3) business days.  A visit to the Licensee’s corporate headquarters or place of business and audit of records is expected to take no more than four (4) to five (5) business days. 

3.	Exit Interview with Licensee:

	Upon completion of the actual audit which is estimated to require approximately 11 business days, an exit interview and briefing shall be conducted by the Contractor with the Licensee to present findings and to provide the Licensee an opportunity to explain and/or correct any deficiencies found during the interview.

4.	Audit Report and Debriefing with the Project Officer:

	A Preliminary Written Report shall be prepared by the Contractor and delivered to the Project Officer within thirty (30) business days of completing the exit interview with GSK.  On receipt, the Project Officer will immediately forward a copy of the Preliminary Written Report to NIAID’s Director, Office of Technology Development.  A debriefing or phone conference with the Contractor will be scheduled by the Project Officer within 15 business days of receiving the Preliminary Written Report.  The debriefing or phone conference shall include a NIAID observer(s).   

	The Preliminary Written Report shall contain all relevant raw data, auditing procedures, findings, analyses of reported findings, and conclusions.  At a minimum, the report shall address the following highlights:

a.	Comparison of data submitted to NIH with the Licensee’s internal records;
b.	Comparison of Licensee inventory with reported production of Licensed Product;
c.	Comparison of Licensee shipping and receiving records;
d.	Comparison of Licensee shipping records to shipping invoices;
e.	Determination of methods used and analysis of Licensee’s calculations of royalties for each Licensed Product;
f.	Determination of the methods used and analysis of Licensee’s input of sales data for each Licensed Product;
g.	Comparison of location of Licensee’s actual sales force with location of reporting offices;
h.	Analysis of periodic sales fluctuation over period relative to season or period of Licensee’s fiscal year;
i.	Analysis of currency valuation versus Licensee’s sales reporting for sales in foreign currencies; and
j.	Comparison of sales volume of products which are complimentary to the Licensed Product for the same reporting period.

Travel:

The Contractor shall travel to Rixensart, Belgium or where the Licensee’s sales records for License Product are kept in order to conduct this audit.  The NIAID requires that the Contractor travel to at least one distribution center in the United States and one in Europe.  It is estimated that one domestic and one foreign trip to two European countries shall be required.  If the Government shall modify the contract due to unforeseen circumstances, additional travel issues shall be considered before modification.  In addition, the Contractor shall only be reimbursed for reasonable travel costs that are allowable under Government travel regulations.  In addition, the travel time of employees will not be reimbursed at their hourly pay rates under this contract.

Deliverables:

The Contractor shall provide:

1.	a Compliance Review Plan to the Project Officer within five (5) business days of completing a compliance review briefing (On receipt, the Project Officer will immediately forward an electronic copy of the Compliance Review Plan to NIAID’s Director, Office of Technology Development);

2.	a Preliminary Audit Report as defined above to the Project Officer within 30 business days of completing the exit interview with GSK (On receipt, the Project Officer will immediately forward an electronic copy of the Preliminary Audit Report to NIAID’s Director, Office of Technology Development); and

3.	a Final Audit Report to the Project Officer within 120 days of the award notification.

Both an electronic copy and at least one signed hard copy of the Final Audit Report shall be sent to the Project Officer at the following address:

				NIH Office of Technology Transfer
				6011 Executive Blvd, Suite 325
				Rockville, MD 20852

(On receipt, the Project Officer will immediately forward an electronic copy of the Final Audit Report to NIAID’s Director, Office of Technology Development).

Period of Performance:

Contractor shall contact the Project Officer within ten (10) days of award notification.  The date of contact shall be deemed the start date for the period of performance and the final day of the period of performance shall be 120 days after the start date.

Table Three:	Selected Discrepant or Possible Noncompliant Findings from the GSK 2004
 		Audit Report										

Point from the 
2004 Audit Report	
Discrepant or Possible Noncompliant Finding	
Resolution

(6)	
Trend analyses of sales by licensed products were prepared but not included in the 2004 Audit Report.

It is not clear from the text whether the Contractor prepared trend analyses based on gross or net sales and there is no mention of any periodic sales fluctuations over the period as requested in the SOW.
	
Contractor to provide schedules summarizing gross sales from net sales by both product and license and by geographic region (domestic vs. foreign).  Further, there must be a test of the gross and net sales figures based on sales invoices and shipping tickets.


(7)	
The Contractor noted that the Merck & Co. royalty stacking provision is for sales in the United States, Canada and Spain.  Further, the Contractor was unable to determine whether the intent of the royalty stacking provision was to limit the credit taken by Licensee on sales of NIH Licensed Product, where both NIH and Merck & Co. earn a royalty on the sale of similar products in the same country.	
As the license agreements are silent with respect to our ability to review third-party agreements, and given the inability of the Contractor to discern the intent of the above stacking provision, the Contractor shall review the entire Merck & Co. Agreement with the Licensee and ascertain whether Licensee applied the proper credit against royalty payments due the NIH.

Contractor to verify amounts of royalties were actually paid by Licensee to Merck for a Hepatitis A (Giesa) patent license and whether these amounts correspond to what Licensee reported to NIH.  


(8)	
Unable to review Licensee’s sales amounts and correlate this information with actual invoices and shipping tickets.  Licensee did not provide detailed sales reports in conjunction with the appropriate sales invoices.  Instead, Licensee provided selected invoices for review.  	
Without the detailed sales reports and associated invoices or random samples thereof, the Contractor was unable to verify the accuracy and evaluate the integrity of the financial information presented in the royalty reports submitted to NIH by the Licensee.  In brief, the main purpose of the 2004 audit was not met and the audit report deemed inconclusive by NIAID’s Office of Financial Management.  Inspect actual invoices and shipping tickets at a minimum of two distribution centers, one U.S. and one European and correlate this data with licensee’s sales figures.



(11)	
Sales journals from the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States were reviewed and it was found that the total sales amounts and quantities sold were in agreement with the royalty computations without exception.  However, the Contractor was not able to verify the accuracy of the journal entries as they were not given actual invoices and/or shipping tickets.
	
Journal entries must be verified by actual invoices and/or shipping tickets.

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout Audit at the selected distribution centers.

(12)	
Based on an inventory usage reasonableness test, it is noted that shipments from Belgium to the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States exceeded the reported sales figures by approximately 10% for 2002 and 2003.	
It is unclear whether this test was applied to any other years.  However, the Contractor noted that it did not have access to ending inventory quantities or scrap rates, which may explain the discrepancy.

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout audit.


(15)	
Licensee requested a $1.57 million dollar credit for royalties paid on U.S. government sales during the period 1995 through 2001 under the non-exclusive license.  Licensee did not provide actual invoices but instead relied on sales figures from management or “channel” reports.  Based on these reports, approximately 75% of the sales were directed to the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) which may be deemed a valid U.S. government sale.  Whereas, 25% of the sales were directed at non-government entities such as the American Red Cross and would not qualify under the specified U.S. government sales credit.  
	
This credit should be denied until Licensee provides the proper supporting documentation.  Further, if this credit is allowed at some future date, it would probably be in our best interest to apply the credit before the Merck & Co. stacking credit.

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout Audit.

(16)	
Inconsistencies were noted in the application of discounts and credits (e.g., customer discounts, U.S. sales credit and corporate credits) in worksheets reflecting U.S. sales data.  At one Licensee facility in the United States, “the difference between the gross sales and net sales was almost 50% of sales.” 	
The Contractor was unable to verify these discrepancies.  However, this difference is significantly out of line with historical sales data on licensed products..

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout Audit.


Experience  in providing similar services must be demonstrated.  This market survey is being conducted through   the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.  Responding firms shall  provide 2 copies of their tailored capability statement to the attention of Marcia Goldman, Office of Acquisitions, OLAO, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7663,   by July 3, 2008.  Respondents shall address their small business representatives when sending in capability statements.

<DESC>Title: Geologic Mapping in Arkansas Units of the National Park Service

Overview
The National Park Service (NPS) has undertaken a Geologic Resource Evaluation (GRE) of 270 natural area park units. NPS has a need to evaluate four park units in Arkansas: Hot Springs National Park (HOSP), Buffalo National River (BUFF), and Arkansas Post National Memorial (ARPO).  Each park is provided with: 
1) An evaluation of park geologic resources and issues, 2) An assessment of geologic map coverage and production of digital products, and 3) A compilation of a geologic report with basic geologic information, hazards and issues, and existing data and research relating to the park.
Geologic mapping, particularly in areas of complex geology, requires particular expertise and familiarity with the various features and processes inherent in these areas.  This project will provide resource management at these four park units with the necessary geologic information to help make scientifically sound resource management decisions.
Scope of Work
The NPS is seeking contractors who must be capable of producing a digital geologic map, defined as a map that depicts the geographic distribution at the Earth's surface of bedrock and/or surficial geologic materials and structures, on a published base map showing topography, hydrography, culture, cadastral, and other base information.  Digital geologic maps may also contain a great variety of point data for specific sites, creating a 3-dimensional database, where applicable.  A geologic map generally includes an explanation, description of map units and symbols, cross sections, and a variety of other information.  Geologic maps produced under this contract must meet those standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2004 STATEMAP program announcement No. 04hQPA0003.    This document can be found online at http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/STATEMAP/index.html.
For Buffalo National River: Produce geologic maps covering four USGS 7  minute quadrangles on the eastern end of BUFF:  Maps must seamlessly edge match with previous geologic mapping. 
For Hot Springs National Park:  Produce geologic maps covering four USGS 7  minute quadrangles using previous produced preliminary Geologic Worksheets, however additional refinement of the stratigraphic units remains to be completed.  
For Arkansas Post National Memorial Park:  Digitize the Arkansas Post and Watson 7  minute quadrangles from the existing, non-digital Gillett and Red Fork "reconnaissance grade" 15 minute geologic worksheets by ARGS and where applicable merge with digital data from the two 1994 publications by R.T. Saucier on the Quaternary Deposits of the Helena-Little Rock 1x2 sheet and the Configuration of Suballuvial Surface of the Helena-Little Rock 1x2 sheet.
An accuracy assessment (peer review) must be conducted to validate the final maps. 
The anticipated Period of Performance for the entire project (all quadrangles mapped) is 36 months from award. 
Final map products will include: "	Digital geologic map, preferably in ESRI ArcGIS 9.x or latest version; personal geodatabase (.mdb) for each digital geologic-GIS map with a Geologic Unit Information table and Source Map Information table, where applicable.  At a minimum, all geologic features present on the published map(s) are present as GIS data, and are fully attributed shape files to standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2004 STATEMAP program announcement No. 04hQPA0003"	Accompanying text and graphics containing map explanatory information, "	A description of map units; "	A stratigraphic column depicting stratified units;"	Where applicable, a correlation diagram showing age relationships of map units;"	An explanation of map symbols; and"	FGDC compliant metadata for all files developed.

Interested parties should provide information addressing the task and their expertise by COB July 3, 2008.   Please contact Sybil Winfield, contract specialist at:  sybil_winfield@nps.gov or (303)969-2076.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information only.  This is not an announcement requesting proposals and no purchase order will be awarded from this announcement.  The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide a Sediment Profile Camera that meets the following specifications.

The digital sediment profile camera unit shall include a housed optics/camera/electronics assembly, a prism assembly, a frame assembly, a trigger, a battery charger, “mud doors”, at least 250 pounds of lead weights, a download cable, a technical instruction manual, storage boxes, and all other necessary equipment.  This unit must meet the following specifications:

1 - Unit is self-contained, requiring only a physical cable connection to the sampling vessel.  All deployed components are rugged, constructed of materials resistant to corrosion in sea water, and rated at 1,000 meter working depth minimum.

2 - Prism window dimensions are 15 cm wide (+ 1 cm) by (at least) 20 cm tall, to deliver a “sample size” that provides consistency with developed image indices.  Prism provides convenient access for filling and draining.  Leading (lower) edge of prism has no protruding screw heads or other roughness on window side that would disturb the imaged sediment.  Interior of prism, including all screw heads, strobe arm, etc, has been blacked out to minimize reflection.

3 - Digital imager has a minimum 6 megapixel resolution, and is readily available as a replacement. Timing between triggering and image capture is adjustable by the operator.  Unit has battery and memory capacity to capture at least 250 images before data download or battery recharge.

4 - Prism/camera system has been tested and fine-tuned so that image is in focus over the entire plane of penetration, is properly exposed, and is reasonably free from artifacts including unevenness of illumination, glare areas, or repeating spot reflections (noting that some artifact is almost unavoidable in sediment profile images due to the complexities of introducing a bright light source into a prism with a mirror and several other reflective surfaces).  Prior to acceptance of device, manufacturer provides two test images to document: 1) resolution at the center, corners, and bottom of image (e.g., image of any finely detailed subject that fills entire prism window, taken with the prism submerged in water and all ambient light blocked off); and 2) freedom from glare artifacts (e.g., image of grey card or black card taken with the prism submerged in water and all ambient light blocked off).

5 - Frame utilizes a sliding “carriage” apparatus to stabilize and deploy the prism.  Frame unit includes an adjustable hydraulic piston to control rate of prism descent.  Frame disassembles for shipping.  Frame also includes deck safety pins, a “wiper blade”, penetration stops, and a penetration indicator collar.  Prism penetration weights are included, and a rapid mechanism is provided to allow adding or removing weights from the sliding carriage.

These specifications are critical to provide: 1) comparability with the bulk of existing sediment profile images; 2) images that allow consistent application of indices such as the Organism-Sediment Index and Benthic Habitat Quality Index; 3) ease of use; and 4) instrument longevity.

Interested parties should submit a capability statement and product information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the equipment described above.   Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. The applicable NAICS code is 423410.  In the capabilities statements, contractors must provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned concern.  Responses to the above should be submitted to Curt Ushijima at ushijima.curt@epa.gov by 5:00 p.m. PT, on July 7, 2008.

The M228 is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used in conjunction with the M69 Grenade body, as a trainer for the M67 Fragmentation Hand Grenade. The M228 provides a loud report and emits a small puff of smoke when activated. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the body. When the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer. The primer ignites a delay element, which initiates the igniter, which in turn provides an audible signal and emits a small amount of smoke. <BR><BR>This survey is restricted to the NTIB for both large & small business concerns.   Anticipated quantities, for purposes of this survey, are in the following ranges: 550k/month for FY09, 270k/month for FY10, 230k/month for FY11, 230k/month for FY12, and 300k/month for FY13.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10: MARKET RESEARCH. This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only. This RFI is seeking interest from 8(A) Companies only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the United States (U.S) Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party’s expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

SCOPE: The USCG is seeking interest from 8(A) vendors interested and capable of assisting the USCG in implementing its Recreational Boat Testing and Factory Compliance Program (RBFCP) for the Nation’s approximately 4,000 recreational boat manufacturers.  These services shall consist of the following: (1) regular testing of recreational boats that are 20 feet or less in length, associated marine equipment, and specialized boats and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, (2) periodic inspections of boat manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with existing Federal regulations, and (3) engaging in educational outreach to recreational boat manufacturers regarding current regulations and available resources. Boats tested may be outboard (O/B), inboard (I/B), inboard/outboard (I/O), or manually powered.  The USCG does not test canoes, racing boats, airboats, or catamarans.  Regulations enforced through the RBFCP are defect notifications, boat identification, safe loading, safe powering, and level flotation for boats less than 20 feet in length.  The RBFCP also ensures compliance with the regulations for level flotation, electrical systems, gasoline fuel systems, ventilation, start-in-gear protection, and navigation lights.  Information collected from each factory inspection is recorded and maintained in the U.S. Government owned Manufacturer’s Identification Code (MIC) database.

BACKGROUND: The USCG is responsible for the oversight and enforcement of Federal Regulations for recreational boats and associated marine equipment.  The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, as codified into Title 46 United States Code Chapter 43, gave the USCG authority to establish comprehensive boating safety programs; authorized the establishment of National construction and performance standards for boats and associated equipment; created a more flexible regulatory authority concerning the use of boats and associated equipment to include all recreational vessels and expanded the Coast Guard’s jurisdiction to all United States navigable waters.  The first Federal regulations were adopted from industry standards published by the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) and other boating industry associations.  These minimum regulations covered defect notifications, boat identification, safe loading, safe powering, and level flotation for boats less than 20 feet in length.  Eventually, regulations for level flotation, electrical systems, gasoline fuel systems, ventilation, start-in-gear protection, and navigation lights were added. One element of oversight and enforcement is accomplished by physically testing boats and associated marine equipment for compliance with these Federal safety regulations.  The USCG acquires boats through a voluntary program where manufacturers provide boats free of charge to the USCG for testing.  The USCG also buys boats, both new and used, in the open-market for testing, targeting boats that are likely to fail one or more segments of the testing procedure.  A vital element of the RBFCP is to ensure that the most up to date information regarding recreational boat manufacturers is maintained in the MIC database.  This information is collected during each factory inspection and directly updated into the database.

REQUIREMENTS.

A. FACTORY COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
1. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP).  The Contractor shall develop a SOP for use by the Contractor’s Compliance Associates from existing Factory Compliance Program materials. The Contractor shall specifically define categories of factory inspections including remote verification, physical verification, inspection, and education.  The level of detail of inspection/education visits are further broken down into categories that reflect the complexity of the manufacturer’s operation visited.  The Contractor shall outline methods of collection, packaging, and shipping of associated material samples collected at the direction of the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).  The category and level of factory inspection must have a direct correlation with the effort and pricing by the contractor.  

2. FACTORY COMPLIANCE ASSOCIATE’S MANUAL.  The Contractor shall submit, for COTR approval, a comprehensive Factory Compliance Associate’s manual describing the procedures and requirements necessary to successfully perform a factory inspection while minimizing disruption to a manufacturer's operations.  The Contractor shall establish procedures to properly document findings from completed factory inspections. The completed manual will become the property of the Government.

3. BOAT MANUFACTURERS DATABASE (MIC).  Upon receipt, the Contractor shall review the Boat Manufacturers Database (hereafter referred to as the MIC database) and make recommendations for improving the database and manner in which it is maintained and updated.  The Contractor shall not institute any changes to the database without prior written COTR approval.  Upon receiving COTR approval, the Contractor shall make changes to the database.  This database shall be maintained by the Contractor, but shall remain the property of the Government.

3.1 The Contractor shall provide the Government full remote access to the MIC Database so that data entry, queries, and generate reports can be performed as needed.  The Contractor shall ensure that the MIC Database remains searchable by report number, case number, a six-digit CA identification number, factory name and Manufacturers Identification Code. 

4. COMPLIANCE ASSOCIATE TRAINING. Contractor shall submit for COTR approval a Compliance Associate certification and training program to assure Factory Inspectors are thoroughly familiar with pertinent regulations and voluntary standards.    The training shall also provide Compliance Associate’s with communication, record keeping and other skills that may be needed by Compliance Associate in order to present themselves in a professional and effective manner.  The certification training must be satisfactorily completed within thirty days of contract signing and before a Compliance Associate may conduct any factory inspections.  Before implementation, the re-certification training shall be approved by the COTR.  Documentation of each Compliance Associate’s initial certification and annual re-certification training shall be provided to the COTR.

4.1 The Contractor shall establish and implement an annual re-certification training program for Compliance Associates.  This training is to ensure that Compliance Associate’s remain current with federal laws and regulations as well as changing trends in the manufacture of recreational boats.  Training offered by organizations such as ABYC, the NMMA, Boat U.S., the American Bureau of Shipping or other sources that provide technical instruction in areas relative to boat structures and marine systems can be included as part of the re-certification training program. Before implementation, the re-certification training program shall be approved by the COTR.

5. FACTORY COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS. The Contractor shall provide all management, tools, equipment, and service required, to accomplish a minimum of 2000 factory inspections per year and provide the USCG with a case report on each inspection.  The Contractor shall schedule Factory Compliance Inspections in according to the size, complexity, and type of production, geography, and the manufacturer’s history of compliance.  Any manufacturer with a history of non-compliance will be given priority status for inspection scheduling.  Contractor shall ensure that all factories are inspected at least once within three years of the beginning of the contract (taking into account past inspections conducted on the previous contract).  Repeat inspections shall be scheduled with the approval of the COTR.

5.1 The Contractor shall develop and implement a formal means of soliciting feedback and addressing concerns of facility operators that are generated as a result of the Factory Inspection program. The Contractor shall develop a method to resolve conflicts arising from the Factory Inspection program.  The Contractor shall provide a summary of comments, conflicts and resolutions in the Factory Compliance Inspection Reports. 

5.2 The Contractor shall designate each factory inspection as a case with its own unique tracking number, which commences with the inspection and ends when all comments, conflicts, headquarter items, and other pending issues have been resolved.  The Contractor shall develop and implement a database to track the status and progress of all cases, and have a web-enabled interface that allows the USCG to access the database. 

5.3 The Contractor shall develop and implement a means of conducting telephone-only (remote) verifications.  Remote verification is typically utilized for low-volume or special order manufacturers that do not have a history of cited issues or campaigns (a campaign is a recall of a recreational boat model).

5.4 The Contractor shall develop a Factory Inspection case report format that provides essential details of each inspection and each segment of the regulations the manufacturer was subject to.  The format shall capture all aspects of current recreational boat manufacturing requirements.  The Compliance Associate shall complete this report in a draft format, which is to be completed during the factory inspections, and then enter the validated information into the computerized database no later than seven days after completion of each factory inspection. The Contractor shall keep the draft format report in a case file until it is replaced by the following report from a subsequent inspection.

5.5 The Contractor shall use a standard letter format to communicate Defect Notifications, corrections to future production boats and recalls to manufacturers.  These notifications shall include a method for constructive feedback from the manufacturer.  Each manufacturer shall have this letter mailed or delivered to their attention no later than twenty-one days after completion of each Factory Inspection.  

5.6 The Contractor shall, during the course of Factory Inspections, actively promote the voluntary boat testing program and other quality assurance programs administered by the USCG.  The Contractor may also be directed to participate in boating industry group meetings and conferences to provide details about the Recreational Boat Factory Inspection Program and any Lessons Learned during the course of the inspection program.  The Contractor may, at the direction of the COTR, be directed to disseminate information of special interest during Factory Inspections.

B. BOAT TESTING. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE NO GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT PROVIDED FOR BOAT TESTING. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL FURNISH ALL LABOR, TOOLS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR THE BOAT TESTING.

6. ASSOCIATED MATERIAL SAMPLE COLLECTION.  When requested by the COTR, the Contractor shall collect associated boat equipment material samples used by a particular manufacturer, and forward these objects to a testing facility specified by the COTR.  Purchase and other forwarding (shipping) expenses shall be cost reimbursable items.  

7. PURCHASING BOATS AND ASSOCIATED MARINE EQUIPMENT.  The Contractor shall recommend candidate boats and associated marine equipment for testing to the COTR.  The recommendation shall be based on the Contractor’s judgment that there is a high probability of non-compliance with 33 CFR 183 by the candidate boats.  The Contractor shall procure test boats and associated marine equipment after approval of the COTR.  Boats identified for purchase by the test program shall have standard equipment and accessories supplied by the manufacturer.  If optional equipment is offered which may have an impact on the compliance test results, or the probable resale value at the GSA auction, the COTR may authorize purchase of the optional equipment.

7.1 Purchased boats shall be obtained from a boat dealer, retailer, manufacturer, or, in the case of used boats, a private seller.  The Contractor shall schedule the purchase of test boats with consideration to the availability of cost effective means of transportation to the test site, availability of storage at the test site, workload at the test site, and resale market opportunities.

7.2 The Contractor shall not indicate to the seller in any way that the boat is being purchased on behalf of the USCG for compliance testing.  When circumstances of the purchase of the boat makes it necessary to disclose the purpose of the purchase, the Contractor shall examine the purchased boat to ensure that it is representative of boats available to the general public.

7.3 The preferred method of procuring test boats is to request that individual manufacturers volunteer boats for the test program.  The Contractor shall attempt to obtain a boat by requesting it be volunteered before any effort is made to purchase the boat.  When purchased, boats shall be obtained at the lowest possible price.  The COTR may authorize a higher price per purchase when necessary to obtain a boat with a high probability of failure to comply with Federal Regulations.  All purchasing records, bids, etc. shall be retained and provided to the COTR concurrent with monthly invoices for payment. 

7.4 The Contractor shall, at the direction of the COTR, purchase associated marine equipment used for recreational boating for testing.  The Contractor shall obtain all necessary documentation for associated marine equipment that clearly indicates the equipment is intended for use on a recreational boat.

8. TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF BOATS. The Contractor shall ensure that purchased boats are transported to the contractor’s test facility.  Transportation cost invoices, records, and quotations must be retained by the Contractor and provided to the COTR along with the Contractor’s invoice seeking reimbursement.

8.1. The Contractor shall ensure that volunteered boats are transported from the manufacturer to the test facility and returned to the manufacturer at the completion of testing.  Transportation shall be arranged at the lowest possible cost.  In lieu of transporting a volunteer boat, the Contractor may pay the manufacturer a fixed mileage rate and per diem for round-trip transportation of the volunteered boat from the factory to the test site.  The fixed mileage rate and per diem shall be at the current Government travel rate specified in the Federal Travel Regulations.

8.2. The Contractor shall be responsible for storage and security of boats and associated marine equipment before, during, and after testing.  The Contractor shall be accountable for all boats and associated marine equipment from arrival at the test facility to disposal and must maintain a verifiable inventory at all times.  Stored boats and associated marine equipment must be sheltered to preserve their characteristics and value.  The only suitable method for storing unsheltered boats and associated marine equipment is by shrink-wrapping with proper ventilation.  The shrink-wrap method of storage must be approved by the COTR prior to use.

9. TESTING OF BOATS, UNIQUE BOATS, AND ASSOCIATED MARINE EQUIPMENT.  The Contractor shall test all volunteered and purchased boats in accordance with the USCG’s Test Policy and Procedures Document.  The Contractor shall, at the direction of the Government, purchase and test unique recreational boats and associated marine equipment, including unique marine equipment intended to prevent drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning, propeller injury, or other injuries or casualties that may be associated with recreational boating.  In the event appropriate testing facilities are not available, sub-contracting to outside testing organizations such as UL and the SAE is acceptable.  Volunteered boats have priority for testing and retesting over purchased boats.

9.1 When a purchased or volunteered boat fails testing, the boat shall be re-tested within fifteen calendar days after corrections to the boat have been made.  Manufacturers that supply volunteer boats are responsible for all repair decisions and procedures regarding the preparation of failed boats and their re-test.  The Contractor shall not perform repairs on volunteered boats under any circumstances.  Contractor may make repairs on purchased boats if the manufacturer, after notification of test failure, fails to provide materials and labor necessary to adequately repair the boat in order to pass the re-test.  If a manufacturer is confirmed out of business, the Contractor may, at the direction of the COTR, make all necessary repairs to sell the boat at auction.  Boats undergoing re-test do not require a second 18-hour pre-soak.

9.2 When a volunteered boat fails testing, the manufacturer or person volunteering the boat may choose not to make corrections to the failed boat.  In this event, the Contractor shall forward a failed test report indicating that the boat was not re-tested at the direction of the manufacturer or owner.

9.2.1 If the manufacturer fails to respond to the Contractor’s first boat failure report and letter within thirty calendar days of mailing, the Contractor shall send out a second letter to the boat manufacturer, via Registered U.S. Mail, return receipt requested. 

10. REPAIR OF BOATS AFTER TESTING. To correct a non-compliance issue, the boat manufacturer can either provide the labor, materials, and tools to repair the boat at the Contractor’s facility, or make provisions to have the boat repaired at another facility.  The Contractor shall keep the COTR apprised of the manufacturer’s progress in repairing the boat with a paragraph in the monthly progress report.

10.1 If a boat is released to the manufacturer for repairs at another facility, the manufacturer is responsible for all costs associated with transportation of the boat.  The manufacturer must agree to return the boat to the Contractor’s facility for re-testing no later than thirty days after the boat has been repaired.  The Contractor shall obtain a signed receipt for the released boat.  The Contractor shall notify the COTR within seven calendar days after the boat has been released to the manufacturer and within seven calendar of the boat’s return.  If more than thirty days is required to repair the boat, the Contractor must notify the COTR of the expected return of the boat for re-testing.

11. POST TEST SALE OR DESTRUCTION OF BOATS. Purchased boats will be sold or destroyed after testing. 

11.1 The Government will be responsible for the reselling of the boats that have passed the compliance testing to the general public through the GSA via Open Auction sale at least one time per year.  The Contractor shall notify the COTR when the quantity of boats ready for auction reaches thirty. 

11.2 The Contractor shall provide auction facilities, including office space with telephone for GSA representatives two days preceding the auction as well as on the day of the auction.  This office space shall have only one open entrance with all other entranced locked in accordance with local fire ordinances.  The Contractor shall clean the boats three days prior to the auction.  The Contractor shall arrange for public inspection of boats two business days prior to the auction and through the day of the auction.  The Contractor shall load the boats onto the purchaser’s conveyance upon request.  Boats not sold will be retained in storage.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary clerical and administrative support associated with conducting an auction including spotting boats, recording bids, and operating the fork lift when necessary during the auction.

11.3 If elected by the COTR, the GSA may hold an online auction in lieu of a physical auction.  The Contractor shall support the online auction by making boats available for inspection in accordance with GSA guidelines. 

11.4 Boats selected for destruction shall be destroyed in a manner that prevents later use in the water.  The Contractor shall, at least ten days prior to the planned destruction date, request destruction approval from the COTR by fax or email providing details of the destruction method, place, and time.  The COTR will notify the Contractor of approval/disapproval of destruction within five calendar days of receipt of the Contractor’s destruction request.  For boats approved for destruction, the Contractor shall take one photograph of each boat before, during, and at the completion of destruction to serve as proof that the destruction was complete.  Each picture shall include a placard showing the boat number, hull identification, and date of destruction.  The Contractor shall be responsible for removal of destroyed boats to the local landfill.  The COTR reserves the right to witness any or all boat destruction work.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: the VA Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Karl Storz Endoscopy America, 600 Corporate Point, Culver City, CA 90230, under the  authority of FAR 6.302-1. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-04. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. This procurement is to obtain a laryngoscope that is the only video laryngoscope on the market which uses a standard shaped laryngoscope blade.  That is important because when teaching laryngoscopy, a standard blade can be used, thereby allowing an instructor to mentor a student using a conventional device, but monitoring what the student sees via the monitor.  That makes it difficult for a student to damage the larynx or perform an esophageal intubation (which are common when training intubators).  This is the only video laryngoscope which can be used either in direct (conventional method) or indirect.THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, July 3, 2008, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (402) 449-0612.

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only and part of market research.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission or responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.
The 419 FLTS, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA is seeking sources that can provide for two (2) MD50C-5, C-Band Radar Transponders.  The following describes this device.  The MD50C-5 Radar Transponder is a miniature precision augmentation device used to enhance the capability of C-band radars.  Utilized primarily for range safety functions, the MD50C-5 is suitable for use in both manned and unmanned vehicles.  This transponder is applicable to precision tracking of aircraft, sounding rockets, missiles, and drone targets both sea and airborne.  Use of a state-of-art RF-to-video detection receiver eliminates typical IF down conversion components (such as oscillator), mixer and IF amplifier.  The reduced parts count leads to increased overall unit reliability.
The design of the MD50C-5 utilizes the latest in modern devices and circuitry.  It is all solid state, except for the triode transmitter, to provide a reliable product with extremely long operating life.  Features:  50 Watt peak power output; long-life triode cavity oscillator transmitter; sensitive direct RF-to-video detection receiver; small, less than 30 cubic inches (490 cubic cms); lightweight, less than 20 ounces (567 grams); tunable over 5.4 to 5.9 GHz; adjustable internal delay; reverse polarity power lead protection; single and double pulse interrogation settings; adjustable code spacing; built-in duplexer for single antenna operation and protection from high antenna reflections.
Responses must include the following:   (1)  Name of corporate point of contact (POC), telephone number, full mailing address, email address, Type of Business (Small/Large), CAGE code, NAICS identifier and any other pertinent information.  (2) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to development and production military and/or commercial product.  (3)  Written responses shall be sent via U.S. Mail, express/overnight deliveries, or courier service for receipt at Edwards AFB no later than 3:30 PM (local time) on 14 July 2008, addressed to Grace Watson, 412 TENG/CL, 307 E. Popson Avenue, Bldg 1400, Rm 104, Edwards Air Force Base, CA 93524.  All questions and comments are to be submitted to Grace Watson at email:  grace.watson@edwards.af.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NASA/GSFC is soliciting information in preparationfor the competition of the Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition (RSA) follow-on.  Previouslyknown as Rapid II (Rapid 2), the new procurement will be referred to as Rapid III (Rapid3). The Rapid III acquisition may result in the award of multiple fixed-priced, commercial,Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for spacecraft bus core systemsthat would be used to meet the Governments science and technology needs. Under the RSAprocess, contracts are awarded to vendors based on their ability to meet specificcriteria (for example:	the ability to carry out the Statement of Work (SOW);  and aheritage spacecraft which has been successfully mated and interface tested with itslaunch vehicle).  Vendors would submit core spacecraft designs that could be successfullymodified as carriers for one or more flight instrument payloads.  Each core spacecraftsystem would need to supply all necessary design, fabrication, assembly, test, flightpayload instrument integration and test, final observatory (spacecraft plus payload)integration and test, shipping, launch support, on-orbit check-out and operationssupport. Operations support would include all required ground support equipment as wellas associated flight and ground based software and software maintenance for thespacecraft offered. Purpose of this RFI: The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information, comments and suggestions fromspacecraft manufacturers regarding:a.  Potential offerors.b.  Estimated number and type of potential spacecraft offerings.c.  Comments on the Rapid II contract, if any.d.  Suggestions for the Rapid III contract, if any.e.  Responses to the specific issues as delineated in the questions below.The information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will be used todevelop the terms and conditions of the upcoming solicitation. GSFC welcomes anyinformation submitted by interested parties in response to this request. Background:The RSA contract serves as a fast and flexible Government-wide, firm fixed priced (FFP),IDIQ procurement tool for proven spacecraft or spacecraft components.The RSA contract is managed by the Rapid Spacecraft Development Office (RSDO). The RSDOalso facilitates mission-specific spacecraft procurements for government customers viathe RSA contract.  The purpose of the RSA concept is to reduce overall procurement time,as well as reduce mission implementation cost and risk by leveraging proven spacecraftdesigns and commercial practices. The spacecraft under contract are placed in the RSA catalog for possible procurementvia IDIQ delivery orders for mission customers.  These mission-specific delivery ordersare competed amongst the RSA contractors and awarded based on the contractors ability tosatisfy the customers mission requirements. Modifications to the core spacecraft to meetthe specific requirements of future missions are normal and expected. The RSA contract includes an On Ramp feature, which allows for the originalsolicitation to be periodically re-opened in order to give new vendors the opportunity topropose proven spacecraft designs.  On Ramps also give vendors already awarded an RSAcontract the opportunity to propose additional proven spacecraft designs and/or updatetheir existing catalog designs.It is anticipated that the Rapid III contract will be similar to the previous Rapid IIcontract and that it will remain a commercial (FAR Part 12) contract. Those companies notfamiliar with Rapid II are welcome to visit the RSDO website: http://rsdo.gsfc.nasa.gov    for background information. Specifically, review material under Mission Statement andRapid II menu tabs.The range of possible NASA missions is broad in scope, type and size. Therefore, the RSAcontract would seek heritage spacecraft buses of various sizes, capabilities, lifetimes,orbit use and mission suitability, in order to be ready to support a variety of missionneeds quickly.Questions for Industry:Please respond to the following: 1. Do you have an interest in supplying spacecraft under the new Rapid III contract?2. How many core spacecraft would you be interested in offering? 3. Do you have comments regarding the Rapid II contract?4. Do you have suggestions for the future Rapid III contract? 5.  The Government may require a form of Earned Value Management (EVM) reporting in theterms of the contract. What do you envision as a practical implementation of EVM for afixed price contract?  How would this impact your business practices with respect toRapid III?  Please note that this contract will be performance based with payments madeupon the completion of pre-defined milestones.6. The Government may issue the new Rapid III contract under terms other than commercial(FAR Part 12).	What do you see as the pros, cons and impact of an RSA contract writtenas firm fixed price non-commercial (FAR Part 15, rather than FAR Part 12)?  How wouldthis impact your business practices with respect to Rapid III?	Please note that theGovernment intends to maintain a high level of insight into the contractorsimplementation of all delivery orders and to invoke mission specific Mission AssuranceRequirements (MAR).This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will theGovernment pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The anticipatedrelease date for the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for Rapid III is October 2008. The anticipated release date for the final RFP is January 2009 with proposals dueapproximately 45 days after the solicitation release date.  Award of contracts iscontemplated for June 2009. Responses may be submitted via mail to NASA/GSFC, ATTN: Janet Osterman, Code 401.1,Building 16W, Room N115, Greenbelt, MD 20771; or via electronic transmission tojanet.m.osterman@nasa.gov.  For further information please contact Janet Osterman at301-286-7586 or janet.m.osterman@nasa.gov; or Art Unger at 301-286-0404 orArthur.M.Unger@nasa.gov.  Information submitted separate and apart from commercialbrochures will be treated as proprietary, if so marked.  All responses shall be submittedby July 23, 2008. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites forthe release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC><p>Description: USDA/ARS, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL Location, has a requirement for a growth chamber to grow Arabidopsis plants with controlled humidity, photoperiod, temperature and light intensity. An important feature is dimmable lighting so that light can be varied from 0 to 500 micromol m-2 s-1 to allow for plant growth as a function of irradiance. Because Arabidopsis plants are short, a two-tiered growth chamber would maximize plant growth capacity within the cabinet, but still allow for larger plants to be grown in the chamber. We will initially use this chamber to compare photoperiod and irradiance effects on Arabidopsis genotypes differing in capacity for repairs of oxidative damage to proteins, but anticipate many other applications within the Unit. The Salient Characteristics are as follows: 1) Chamber must fit with a space of roughly 95" x 36" (1 x w) 2) Two-tiered reach in chamber is desired to maximize plant growth space 3) Temperature must be controlled from slightly cooler to slightly warmer than ambient (e.g., 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C with lights on) 4) Must have humidity control 5) Must have dimmable lighting, up to 500 micromol m -2 s-1 6) Water cooled condenser 7) Alarm to warn users when temperature and/or humidity is too high and/or too low 8) Installation and training as necessary&nbsp;9) Warranty information.

Note that interviews may or may not be conducted; therefore, the application package should clearly identify how well the applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications of this position. Interviews, if conducted, may be either in-person or via telephone.</p>
<p>2. Information collected from reference checks. References will only be verified for those applicants determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award.</p>
<p>3. Results of a cost assessment. The cost assessment will determine the total cost (salary plus benefits and allowances) of the applicant for the complete term of the contract (base period plus any option years).</p>
<p>Basis for Award</p>
<p>In determining best value, paramount consideration shall be given to technical merit (applicant qualifications and reference checks) rather than to cost. In cases where applicants are determined to be essentially equal, then cost may become the determining factor.</p>
<p>BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY FOR PSC CANDIDATE</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this is a full and open competition, and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Edwards Vacuum Turbopump Station with Dry Backing Pumps for Disc Chopper Spectrometer ***

Brand Name Only Justification:   The NIST Center for Neutron Research requires an Edwards Vacuum turbopump station with dry backing pumps for its Disc Chopper Spectrometer.  

NIST currently employs approximately 60 of the Edwards Vacuum units in the NCNR Labs.  The current design represents a unique design effort between BOC Edwards and NIST.  One of the significant features resulting from this collaborative design effort is a relay box, which is a unique safety feature that protects not only the operator, but the system itself and any equipment to which it may be connected.  

These turbopump stations are now the standardized equipment in the NCNR labs due to these unique features, their proven design, reliability and user interface.  NIST has a substantial investment in replacement parts for these systems in its maintenance inventory, as well as significant monies for the specialized training of its scientific and technical staff in the use and maintenance of this equipment.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Brand Name Only Determination.
 (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)
***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement.***

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a total small business set-aside.
The solicitation number is NIHDA2008058 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.  The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 5417.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to evaluate the feasibility of developing a cocaine vaccine using the approach of conjugating cocaine and/or cocaine derivatives to an adenovirus.  The adenovirus may be human or non-human primate; however, NIDA strongly encourages the non-human primate approach because a substantial percentage of humans have pre-exiting anti-human adenovirus immunity, which would limit the effectiveness of a human adenovirus-based cocaine vaccine.  If conjugation is successful, the contractor shall utilize the adenovirus and covalently linked small molecule to evaluate the feasibility of generating humoral immunity to cocaine in animals.  If necessary, the contractor may devote efforts toward the modification of capsid proteins to enhance interactions with antigen-presenting cells.  The contractor shall act independently, and not as an agent of the Government.  The contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services and perform the work set forth.
At the end of this effort, the contractor shall provide NIDA with a report that summarizes the specific efforts undertaken, areas of success, and areas of failure.
Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on July 28, 2008. For delivery through the postal service, please submit to the Contracting Office Address below.  Electronic transmission will be accepted.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006).

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—

Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006) (Continued).

 (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.



Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006) (Continued).

 (d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. 

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 16 July 2008, 4:15 p.m., EST.     All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.     Anticipated award date is on or about July 24, 2008. Contact Steve Metcalfe at Steven.H.Metcalfe@uscg.mil or 252-335-6714 for questions regarding this solicitation.     Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above address, facsimile copies are acceptable and should be faxed to 252-335-6790, or at the following address:

<DESC><p>This amendment to the solicitation provides answers to questions emailed to 437 Contracting Squadron.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q:&nbsp; Can the training dates for the class be moved further into the future?&nbsp; <strong>Answer:</strong></span>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The scheduled dates for the use of the range has been set and cannot be rescheduled.&nbsp; The training dates, 13 Jul 08 thru 19 Jul 08 (0800 to 1700 HRS), remains unchanged.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: What is the shooting proficiency/firearms level of the students to be trained? <strong>Answer</strong></span><strong>:</strong> The shooting level varies from Basic to Advanced. It is recommended that the course be taught with variances once the student skill level increases.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: Is commercial ammo (Winchester, Federal, etc.) acceptable to use? <strong>Answer:</strong></span> Military Spec ammo is desired but not mandatory.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: Does the 5.56mm have to be Green Tip ammo? <strong>Answer</strong></span>: Ammo cannot be green tip. Ammo must be frangible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: Is foreign made ammo acceptable? <strong>Answer</strong></span>: The ammo must comply with the Buy American Act; see DFARS 252.225-7000 and DFARS 252.225-7001.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: Will a medic be required? <strong>Answer</strong></span><strong>:</strong> No. The government will provide range safety officers. All personnel are trained in self aid/buddy care. Emergency services will be used in case of emergency.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: What firearms level will the 24 AF personnel have prior to training? For example are they Security Police who are very competent in malfunctions, immediate action drills, fire house training and raid training? Are they just basic trained and need in dept training or is this more like a refresher course. It appears from Attachment 1 that basic skills techniques need to be taught leading up each day to a higher level of shooting. <strong>Answer:</strong></span><strong> </strong>The personnel are Combat Camera photographers. Most have limited experience with the M4 and M9, they should all be familiar with the basic fundamentals of shooting but are in need of more in depth training including malfunctions and immediate actions. There are some members who are very experienced and have been through similar courses. Previous courses have had class time teaching fundamentals and then went to the range progressing to a higher level as the time goes on.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: We use 55gr. for our .223 and 115gr. for our 9mm original ammunition. Is there a federal guideline on manufacturer or just grain weight? <strong>Answer</strong></span>: The guidelines we have from FLETC is that the 5.56 needs to be frangible ammunition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q: Our company only uses police SWAT and Firearms instructors, two of the police instructors have prior military combat training (Army Ranger Infantry Captain and Sgt.). The Convoy, IED recognition, team tactics and CQB training, are they based on Air Force SOP or will Army Infantry and police doctrine be sufficient? <strong>Answer:</strong></span> Army Infantry SOPs are acceptable, because the majority of the forces we deploy with are Army units.</p>

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<SOLNBR>AG-6395-S-08-0083
<RESPDATE>072908
<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>A complete copy of the specficaions should be available the week of 07July 2008.  This will be 100% set-aside for small businesses.

The overall objective is for the contractor to work with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA – APHIS) to develop a sensitive, specific assay capable of detecting all Avian Influenza viruses in a mixed sample, including known and unknown strains (i.e., virus drift that would be flagged for follow-up).  Once a technology is established for detecting Avian Influenza other viruses (e.g., Foot and Mouth Disease) will be added.

The Technology should be capable of:
Detection of many types of infectious micro-organisms with a single platform; 
detection of a wide range of infectious micro-organisms (e.g., entire virus genus or family) from any host species with a limited set of reagents - information leading to reagent design may be provided by user or public domain; 

Identification of known, unknown, deliberately altered, divergent, or mutated agents within the 'wide range of agents' cited above; 

Detection of multiple microorganisms simultaneously in a mixed sample (prefer clinical sample); 

Reliable, sensitive, specific, high-throughput (100s-1000/day, with automation if necessary) sample assays in 12 hours or less;

Routinely operable by technician (e.g., BS level) with results able to interpretation by PhD level.

If the assay is marketed in a form that would be subject to Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) licensure, that it be licensed or judged to be at the applicable CVB standard.

CVB Mobile lab or field deployment capability is not required.

Contractor shall be capable of collaboration with APHIS scientists to fit the technology to specific APHIS applications as shown by:

Providing contract testing service or technology deployment to a well-equipped and staffed laboratory; 

Past performance (peer-reviewed publication preferred) of use of technique with influenza (preferably type A, and avian influenza);

Past performance of  successfully working with federal labs to develop applications

The Walter Reed Army Medical Center’s Neurosurgery Department has a requirement to upgrade their current Image Guided Surgery System (IGS).  The Image Guided Surgery System will be used on the following anatomical areas:  brain, spine, orthopedic and Ear/Nose/Throat (ENT).  The IGS should incorporate computerized technologies of multi-dimensional (minimum 3-D) and navigation to enable neurosurgeons to precisely plan, re-plan and visualize a surgical procedure in real-time.  The IGS should be capable of localizing or pinpointing a given target within the treatment area without damaging healthy tissue, muscle, nerves or blood vessels.The IGS System should be able to take images from the following imaging sources:  X-Ray, Computerized Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Ultrasound.  The IGS system should be able to take the images from traditional imaging sources and be able to transform them into precise three-dimensional images (3D).  The 3D images should be capable of being changed, manipulated and merged both before the surgical procedure as well as during the procedure.The IGS system should be capable of analyzing pre-operative diagnostic scans (i.e. CT, MRI) of the patient, and then be able to translate the information into precise 3D images that allow the surgeon to map the safest, least invasive path to the target site.  In the operating suite, the IGS system shall be capable of producing 3D real-time images of the procedure while in progress.  The IGS system shall be capable of merging images form multiple sources and manipulate pictures thus, allowing surgeons to view them from various angles.  The IGS system should be able to incorporate the use of standard surgical instruments.  The images and exact location of the instruments should be readily seen in 3D and in real-time during surgery with the use of the IGS system.  
The IGS system should have software applications for the brain, spinal, orthopedic, and ENT surgeries.  The software should be capable of allowing instant access to a patient’s imaging (i.e. CT, MR, etc.) history.  This retrieved information should be able to be used to assist in making treatment decisions.The IGS should consist of an electromagnetic tracking technology that uses a single-coil engineering to generate an electromagnetic field around the patient’s target anatomy that can be tracked to triangulate the positioning of instruments and patient-tracking devices. The system should be user-friendly with easy to use features to allow the surgeon to concentrate on patient care and not use of the equipment.

Additionally, the SLA will be reviewed to determine that support around software issues will be reviewed in a timely manner and that a 24 hour a day help desk will be made available.  Furthermore, the issue escalation path that is implemented when issues are not resolved by the initial support representative should be outlined in the SLA.  Lastly, a description of the type of software upgrades, and support for the upgrades, should be defined within the SLA.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM/OPS/SIO).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition ETL software product and support identified in Paragraph (3). 
Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 (4) for limited source acquisition and approval, because of upcoming administration changes and to support the increase in congressional inquiries it is critical that the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter ETL tool be procured using the cited authority. The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management requires the purchase of licenses for the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition and first year support that are listed in paragraph (3).  These licenses and support are required to design, develop, and implement a pilot for the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) by November 2008.  The EDW will be used to support questions and analysis that occur during an administration change and congressional inquiries.  This J&A supports the purchase of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition on the basis of a Brand name only acquisition.
The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) is one of eight management reform initiatives reported to the Secretary that the U.S. Department of State (DoS) is currently executing.  The goal of EDW is to greatly diminish many of the challenges currently impacting the use of the Departments historical data, and to provide greater analytical ability to the end users.  This will first be accomplished by giving authorized users of the system desktop access to near real-time data.  This data will be pulled from various source systems and used to populate the EDW through an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool.  The data warehouse will also have a Business Intelligence (BI) component integrated with it.  The BI component will present capability to run standard and ad hoc reports and will also provide tools to perform cross-cutting data analysis along with embedded user-friendly display ability.  By providing these capabilities, the EDW will turn raw data into shared knowledge thereby promoting information sharing throughout the Department.  This knowledge will in turn enhance the decision-making process, boost operating efficiency, and lower operating costs.  In essence EDW will increase the value of the Departments data set and allow the Department to have a forward and backward view of their data so that they may know what has happened, what is happening, and what is likely to happen.<BR><BR>The ETL products and support listed below are required by IRM/OPS/SIO and are developed by Informatica.  These ETL products/support are available for purchase from Informatica and Informatica resellers.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the software/support identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  The Informatica ETL tool is essential for meeting the aggressive schedule of this critical Department initiative.  A/LM/AQM intends to compete IRMs requirements among Informatica resellers possessing a GSA FSS No. 70 contract. The Enterprise Data Warehouse will be used to address queries and conduct analysis to support executive level decisions and to support congressional inquiries.  An ETL tool is the primary means of continuously populating data into a data warehouse.  The Informatica tool is required to perform concurrent data integration and metadata management, to ensure data integrity and to achieve an automated, reusable process implementation for the EDW project. The Informatica tool facilitates rapid processing of vast amounts of data, which is inherently needed to support the kinds of analysis required to assist executive decisions and congressional inquiries.  This speed is supported by targeting multiple data structures simultaneously without having to stage any data.  The Informatica tool will conduct self auditing analysis by capturing metrics around the data integration effort to ensure proper performance is achieved and alert administrators of potential data inconsistencies.  Additionally, the tool has an integrated ability to profile data.  This capability is useful to determine the datas quality and suitability for usage, which is vital to the success of a project dependent on multiple, disparate source systems.  In short the Informatica ETL tool will provide EDW the capability to pull data from disparate source systems in a compressed format with assured delivery of data, assured integrity of data, and checkpoint/restart capability, for recovery of transmissions in the event of a network drop.  These attributes come together to produce an ETL tool which is both flexible and possesses robust reliability.  The requirement will be competed among Informatica resellers that have GSA Schedule No. 70 contracts.  GSA has already determined the schedule prices to be fair and reasonable.  However, the Government intends to competitively award a delivery order to the offeror that represents the overall the best value to the Department.  Although the requirement is justified on a limited source basis, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will include the brand name justification with the posting as required by FAR 8.405-6(d).  The requirement will be competed on FedBid among Federal Supply Schedule No. 70 contractors in compliance with FAR 8.405-6 and AQM Memorandum 08-05.  The Department is prepared to provide the RFQ to additional firms that request copies (reference FAR 8.405-2(c)(4)).<BR><BR>

This J&A supports the purchase of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition on the basis of a Brand name only acquisition.
The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) is one of eight management reform initiatives reported to the Secretary that the U.S. Department of State (DoS) is currently executing.  The goal of EDW is to greatly diminish many of the challenges currently impacting the use of the Departments historical data, and to provide greater analytical ability to the end users.  This will first be accomplished by giving authorized users of the system desktop access to near real-time data.  This data will be pulled from various source systems and used to populate the EDW through an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool.  The data warehouse will also have a Business Intelligence (BI) component integrated with it.  The BI component will present capability to run standard and ad hoc reports and will also provide tools to perform cross-cutting data analysis along with embedded user-friendly display ability.  By providing these capabilities, the EDW will turn raw data into shared knowledge thereby promoting information sharing throughout the Department.  This knowledge will in turn enhance the decision-making process, boost operating efficiency, and lower operating costs.  In essence EDW will increase the value of the Departments data set and allow the Department to have a forward and backward view of their data so that they may know what has happened, what is happening, and what is likely to happen.<BR><BR>The ETL products and support listed below are required by IRM/OPS/SIO and are developed by Informatica.  These ETL products/support are available for purchase from Informatica and Informatica resellers.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the software/support identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  The Informatica ETL tool is essential for meeting the aggressive schedule of this critical Department initiative.  A/LM/AQM intends to compete IRMs requirements among Informatica resellers possessing a GSA FSS No. 70 contract. The Enterprise Data Warehouse will be used to address queries and conduct analysis to support executive level decisions and to support congressional inquiries.  An ETL tool is the primary means of continuously populating data into a data warehouse.  The Informatica tool is required to perform concurrent data integration and metadata management, to ensure data integrity and to achieve an automated, reusable process implementation for the EDW project. The Informatica tool facilitates rapid processing of vast amounts of data, which is inherently needed to support the kinds of analysis required to assist executive decisions and congressional inquiries.  This speed is supported by targeting multiple data structures simultaneously without having to stage any data.  The Informatica tool will conduct self auditing analysis by capturing metrics around the data integration effort to ensure proper performance is achieved and alert administrators of potential data inconsistencies.  Additionally, the tool has an integrated ability to profile data.  This capability is useful to determine the datas quality and suitability for usage, which is vital to the success of a project dependent on multiple, disparate source systems.  In short the Informatica ETL tool will provide EDW the capability to pull data from disparate source systems in a compressed format with assured delivery of data, assured integrity of data, and checkpoint/restart capability, for recovery of transmissions in the event of a network drop.  These attributes come together to produce an ETL tool which is both flexible and possesses robust reliability.  The requirement will be competed among Informatica resellers that have GSA Schedule No. 70 contracts.  GSA has already determined the schedule prices to be fair and reasonable.  However, the Government intends to competitively award a delivery order to the offeror that represents the overall the best value to the Department.  Although the requirement is justified on a limited source basis, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will include the brand name justification with the posting as required by FAR 8.405-6(d).  The requirement will be competed on FedBid among Federal Supply Schedule No. 70 contractors in compliance with FAR 8.405-6 and AQM Memorandum 08-05.  The Department is prepared to provide the RFQ to additional firms that request copies (reference FAR 8.405-2(c)(4)).<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition ETL software product and support identified in Paragraph (3). 
Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 (4) for limited source acquisition and approval, because of upcoming administration changes and to support the increase in congressional inquiries it is critical that the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter ETL tool be procured using the cited authority. The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management requires the purchase of licenses for the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition and first year support that are listed in paragraph (3).  These licenses and support are required to design, develop, and implement a pilot for the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) by November 2008.  The EDW will be used to support questions and analysis that occur during an administration change and congressional inquiries.  This J&A supports the purchase of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition on the basis of a Brand name only acquisition.

<DESC>The original RFP, N68936-05-R-0024, resulted in the issuance of multiple contracts to further research and demonstrate the miniature radio frequency technology cited by each contractor.  The Northrop Grumman  Company received a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract, N68936-05-C-0059, to further research, demonstrate, and deliver MPM technology.  .  The contract included the use of a level-of-effort Long Term Support CLIN (0006) which required Northrop Grumman to provide support after the product was delivered.  The hours originally included in the contract were depleted as a result of unforeseen system integration issues.  As a result, the Government intends to modify the contract to add 300 more level-of-effort hours to provide support through the end of the program; 17 Nov 2008.  Only Northrop Grumman can provide the needed support due to their unique knowledge and technical expertise of their product.  Place of performance is expected to be at the Northrop Grumman site, 600 Hicks Road, MSL 3200, Rolling Meadows, IL, 60008-1098, FOB destination.  Any firm believing they can provide the needed support without substantial duplication of cost and within the current schedule may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 26 July 2008.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Award of the contract modification is expected on or about 11 August 2008.  All requests must reference the contract number N68936-05-C-0059.  Please submit responses in writing to Gary Trimble by email at gary.trimble@navy.mil or by mail to:  Commander, Code 210000D, Attn:  Gary Trimble, 429 East Bowen Rd., China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

<CONTACT>Carrie A Herndon, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-447-5559, Fax 202-447-5564, Email carrie.a.herndon@dhs.gov
<DESC>1. OBJECTIVE & SCOPE

1.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of a centralized geocoding platform (service and/or system) which will best serve the broad geocoding needs of the Department and its component agencies. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit innovative and efficient geocoding methodologies that provide the GMO with insight into the current ‘state of the art’ both from a data content and system perspective. The information collected will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for any enterprise geocoding solution the Department may wish to develop in the future.  

1.2 BACKGROUND
The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize DHS’s return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO has developed a geospatial solutions architecture, the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), which is the technology target for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized geocoding solution that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Department’s enforcement, preparedness, response, recovery mission areas.    

1.3 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS
At present there are approximately 15 known geocoding engines servicing various system requirements within DHS. In this current environment, each geocoding engine and their associated reference layers are maintained by a variety of technology, data, staff and other ongoing operations and maintenance infrastructure. Additionally the amount and availability of geocoding functionality from these various geocoding services is largely inaccessible to the broader end users. These current disparate configurations also hinder the ability for remote staff to access geocoding services in a manner that is timely and efficient. 

1.4 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS
The future geocoding environment for DHS will be consolidated to a single solution that supports Department-wide geocoding operations. This fully integrated solution, will help to minimize overall levels of IT investment, enhance overall service delivery, and will be implemented in one of DHS’s two data warehouses. Although this more centralized environment will likely exist within an infrastructure controlled and managed by the government, it should also be able to leverage distributed services for certain aspects of desired functionality and/or take advantage of a vendor supplied service delivery that might be cost prohibitive for the government to implement or would offer the desired levels of dynamic failover to a redundant service. Centralizing DHS’s geocoding requirements also meets the intent of DHS Management Objective 4030, and the Department’s Investment Portfolio Management Program.  

This future geocoding solution will support DHS business processes in the areas of:

•‘Ad hoc’ street address matching to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

•Batch processing of street addresses to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

•Address validation, certification, correction, and other interpolative capabilities

•Methods of determining and matching the location of landmarks, cities, towns, and other commonly-used geographic references (i.e. ‘Gazetteer’ level functionality)

•Proximal intelligence or supplemental detail on environs of geocoded results beyond simple latitude and longitude returns (i.e. demographics, political boundaries, census designation, Congressional Districts etc…)

•Ability to load and manage custom taxonomies, data dictionaries and GIS datasets.

•Reverse geocoding capabilities to translate incoming coordinate data and dimensionalize that geo-location data to a local street address, nearest populated place etc... 

While serving the businesses processes described above are of immediate interest to the Department and the majority of its mission owners and operators, it is conceivable that a future state of operations may also optionally contain a capability to search text documents using various geographic keywords and display that information geographically on a map interface.   

This future geocoding environment will be implemented in such a way as to support the broadest end users possible, the following DHS components are specifically in scope for this desired implementation given known requirements and existing mission needs:

•Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE)
•Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)
•Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
•U.S. Secret Service (USSS)
•National Operations Center (NOC)
•U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)

Anticipated volume/usage metrics:

•The estimated monthly volume of ‘ad hoc’ geocoding requests………. ….   500,000
•The estimated monthly volume of batch geocoding requests……………... 1,000,000
•The estimated monthly volume of unstructured (gazetteer) requests……. 20,000,000	

Characteristics of the future solution may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:

•Systems provisioned via service oriented architectures/automation interfaces,
•Systems hosted and maintained by solution provider outside DHS firewalls,
•Systems hosted and maintained by DHS within its firewalls,
•Systems that provide graphical user interfaces

2. RESPONSE GUIDELINES & REQUIRED FORMAT

viii.  DHS Use Case Scenarios
In addition to describing the system/architectural elements of their solution(s), respondents should also outline how end users would specifically interact with their proposed solution(s) in the following use case scenarios:

• Batch Geocoding Use Case:
A program analyst has recently received a comma delimited export file from an existing DHS mission critical application. This file contains several hundred thousand to several million addresses which needs to be geocoded in a batch process to support follow on analysis. Some of these records share a single street address (i.e. commercial office or high rise apartment building). Any address which is not directly matched to a particular reference data set should be re-geocoded using multiple reference data sources to reconcile address mismatches. Assuming this analyst has access to the DHS intranet as well as the outside internet, please describe how this end user would interact with the proposed solution to achieve a geocoding match rate above 85% 

• ‘Gazetteer’ Level Functionality: 
A variety of DHS mission domains require access to a rapid map display functionality based on simple keyword searches for purposes of geolocation and to better orient themselves to a particular area of interest quickly. Typical keyword searches used might include:

• Exact/Partial Street Address
• City/Neighborhood/County Name
• Landmark Alias (i.e Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge etc…)

For example, a good Samaritan observes a signal flare from the 3rd floor of his beach front hotel and telephones in to a local US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) operations center. During the call the SAR controller must rapidly translate that observer and observed information to a corresponding Latitude/Longitude, in order to best vector USCG assets to aid those in distress. Please describe how the proposed geocoding solution(s) might support this potential ‘call center’ application and provide a flexible ‘gazetteer’ level functionality to both DHS end users with and without outside internet connectivity.

• ‘Ad-hoc’ Interactive Geocoding from a GIS Enabled Desktop Workstation
Describe how the proposed solution(s) could support a geospatial analyst using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software application to support geocoding in an ‘ad hoc’ or interactive way. Respondents should describe in detail how the proposed solution leverages both existing COTS GIS functionality and any proposed ‘plug-ins’, additional applications, and/or toolbar(s) to support accurate and efficient geocoding. Respondents may assume the geospatial analyst has access to both the DHS intranet and the wider internet.

• ‘Geo’-Entity Extraction from a Structured/Unstructured Text
Please describe how the proposed solution(s) might support a geographic keyword search across a variety of text based documents, messages, and/or reports and then display the results in a geographic context on a map display to better inform analysis and/or decision making.

All questions are to be directed to the contracting officer. All questions will be adjudicated and responses will be posted as amendments/modifications to the RFI to be viewed by all solution providers.

Question 2:
Do we need to be listed on the GSA to participate in this project? IS there any registration required for SRC to do to qualify as a participant on this project? 

Response 2:
No. There is no registration or prequalification needed to reply to an RFI, responses are welcome from any interested solution provider.  This is a RFI and the Government strongly desires the broadest responses possible.

4.2 Questions Received as of 6/12/08

Question 3: 
I would like clarification on several requirements listed in the RFI:
Custom/Supplemental Address Dictionaries or Taxonomies for Gazetteer Functionality – Clarification of the meaning of this requirement

Response 3:
Certain DHS components may have individual requirements to leverage customized or colloquial address dictionaries as supplemental resources to also reference a particular location, sector, neighborhood, and/or place of interest. These data reference sources are expected to be in addition to more known reference data to support a geocoding system(s), such as those developed toward postal addressing standards. Respondents should describe if (and how) additional address/location dictionaries could be supported by their proposed solution.  

Question 4:
I would like clarification on several requirements listed in the RFI:
Business Rules, Heuristic ‘Fallback’ Options, Sensitivity, Conflict Resolution - Clarification of the meaning of this requirement

Response 4:
Respondents should describe how their proposed solution manages address/location verification and what rule(s) base is used to determine an exact geocode. In the event location matches are not exact, respondents should further describe the heuristic methodology by which alternate match candidates can be determined.  Where applicable, respondents should also describe how the heuristic methodology used for determining alternate match candidate(s) can be further refined or ‘tuned’.

Question 5:
I would like clarification on several requirements listed in the RFI:
Adaptability/Compliance with Existing DHS IT Policy/Systems – Can the IT Policy/System be downloaded?

Response 5:
DHS is electing to remove “DHS IT Policy/Systems”. This sentence should now read:

“Adaptability/Compliance with existing industry best practices”

Question 25:
What type of funding is envisioned for the acquisition that would likely emerge from the Geospatial Management Office (GMO) review of the RFI responses?  Specifically, is GMO looking for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems that are ready to be installed to address the RFI’s lists of capabilities, or would information about new research results be considered a useful response to the RFI?  Two other approaches are to identify whether (a) 6.1 (basic research), 6.2 (applied research) or 6.3 funding is available, or (b) software is desired at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 2 or 9 (or somewhere along the range). 

Response 25:
A fiscal strategy for an enterprise geocoding solution will be developed based on the technical solutions provided by this RFI.

Question 26:
We have a component capability that might be useful to a prime respondent.  Is there a mechanism related to the RFI by which we could indicate our availability to team with another company?
