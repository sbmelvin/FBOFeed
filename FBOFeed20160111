<DESC><p>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>AFRL/RITA requires a purchase of one (1) 1 hydra harp time to digital converter system. The system is comprised of the following components: One (1) hydra harp 400M mainframe and four (4) hydra harp 400 TDC modules. (Part number: 930011(QTY 1): Hydra Harp 400M - Mainframe and Part number: 930015 (QTY 4): Hydra Harp 400 - TDC Module). Complete specifications are as follows:</p>
<p>Input Channels and Sync</p>
<p>Discrimination Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD) in all channels, software adjustable<br />Input voltage range: 0 mV to -1000 mV, optimum: -100 mV to -500 mV<br />Trigger point: falling edge<br />Trigger pulse width: 0.5 ns to 30 ns<br />Trigger pulse rise/fall time: 2 ns max.</p>
<p>External Reference Clock</p>
<p>Input: 10 MHz, min. 200 mV, max. 1 V pp, 50 Ohms, AC coupled<br />Output: 10 MHz, 300 mV pp, 50 Ohms, AC coupled</p>
<p>Time to Digital Converters</p>
<p>Minimum time bin width: 1 ps<br />Electrical time resolution: &lt; 12 ps rms<br />Full scale range - histogram mode: 65 ns to 2.19 s <br />Full scale range - time-tagged mode: infinite<br />Maximum count rate per input channel: 12.5 &times; 106 counts/sec<br />Maximum sync rate: 150 MHz<br />Adjustable delay range for each input channel: &plusmn; 100 ns, resolution 1 ps<br />Dead time: &lt; 80 ns<br />Differential non-linearity: &lt; 2 % peak, &lt; 0.2 % rms (over full measurement range)</p>
<p>Histogrammer</p>
<p>Count depth per time bin: 4.294.967.296 (32 bit)<br />Maximum number of time bins: 65536<br />Acquisition time: 1 ms to 100 hours</p>
<p>TTTR Engine</p>
<p>T2 mode resolution: 1 ps<br />T3 mode resolution: 1, 2, 4, ..., 33 554 432 ps<br />FiFo buffer depth (records): 2097152<br />Sustained throughput*(sum of all channels): typ. 40 &times; 106 events/sec</p>
<p>Operation</p>

<p><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>PicoQuant Photonics North America, Inc.<br />9 Trinity Drive<br />West Springfield, Ma, 01089</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement as the Hydra Harp 400 Mainframe (P/N: 930011(QTY 1)) and Hydra Harp 400 TDC Module (P/N: 930015 (QTY 4)) is the highest timing resolution tagging system in a turnkey system that can meet all necessary elements to work with the Government's current applications. The Government's application requires extremely precise timing resolution with low system noise. Typical time to digital converters suffers from low time resolution and low synchronization speeds.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 31 January 2016.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<RESPDATE>012716
<CONTACT>JERRY L. WOODS, Phone 7037673530, Email jerry.l.woods44.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723-6099 for an effort entitled "Mission Design Tool." The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1).
<p>JHU/APL is the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The initial prototype version of the MDT was developed by JHU/APL under a previous DTRA contract. JHU/APL developed the existing formalisms, such as the detection models and interpolation methods and the source term generation engine. JHU/APL was the lead performer in the collection of all the data on which the detection models are based, and thus have an intimate understanding of the limits of applicability of these data in that context. They have also cleaned and consolidated the relevant parts of the datasets and have created customized tools for expediting this development process. Additionally, JHU/APL has significant operational experience in the field of the required passive search modes (mobile, foot-borne, maritime, and aerial) and has worked closely with existing deployment team members to find the right implementation of the toolkit, establishing a rapport with the user community.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to add capabilities to the initial prototype version. These include user-fielded detectors, a mobile search mode for man-portable backpack/handheld detectors, features for the mobile search such as automated map functions and route optimization, and static search modes for vehicle portal and man-portable detectors.</p>
<p>This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government</p>

<RESPDATE>011916
<CONTACT>David Lamb, Contract Specialist, Phone 8032087336, Email david.lamb@srs.gov
<DESC>1.0 Description
<p>1.1 The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking input from commercial industry to help identify the optimal system, structure or component (SSC) to safely contain and disposition low level nuclear waste in the form of Saltstone. The goal of this inquiry is to ascertain from industry experts the most cost effective and timely way to design and construct SDUs with sufficient capacity to maintain uninterrupted liquid waste processing at the Savannah River Site (SRS).</p>
<p>1.2 This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Department of Energy (DOE) is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>SRS processes and stores nuclear materials in support of national defense and U.S. nuclear nonproliferation efforts. One of its missions is to treat nuclear and hazardous wastes left from the Cold War.<br />The SRS Liquid Waste (LW) System is the integrated series of facilities that safely manage the existing waste inventory and disposition waste stored in tanks into a final glass or grout form. This system includes facilities for storage, evaporation, waste removal, pre-treatment, vitrification, and disposal.</p>
<p>The mission of the Saltstone Facility in Z-Area is to process and dispose of radioactive waste salt solution (Decontaminated Salt Solution (DSS)) from the tank farm. Built in the 1980s, the Z-Area Saltstone Facility immobilizes the low level radioactivity waste salt solution by mixing it with a dry material mixture of fly ash, slag, and cement to produce a flowable grout mixture. This grout is poured into large concrete disposal units, where it cures to become Saltstone, a leach-resistant solid monolith, for permanent disposal.<br />The Saltstone Facility consists of two facility segments: The Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) and the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF). The SPF receives the DSS, produces the grout, and transfers the grout. The SDF disposes the grout in Saltstone disposal units (SDUs). The SDF is permitted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) as an Industrial Waste Landfill for disposal of nonhazardous solid waste. The Saltstone monolith<br />provides primary containment for the radionuclides and chemicals in the DSS and the SDUs provide secondary containment. Once all SDUs are filled and closure activities are complete, a backfilled engineering closure will be placed above the SDUs within the SDF providing tertiary containment consistent with all applicable regulations. These disposal cells and the Saltstone matrix are not expected to release any significant amount of radionuclides over the 1,000-year compliance period.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an additional 200Mgal of Saltstone will have to be dispositioned before SRS completes its LW disposal mission.</p>
<p>The first SDU (Vault 1) is approximately 100 feet wide by 600 feet in length by 25 feet in height, divided into six cells and the second SDU (Vault 4) is approximately 200 feet wide by 600 feet in length by 26 feet in height, divided into twelve cells. Neither is planned for future use in emplacing contaminated grout. SDU-2, SDU-3, and SDU-5, currently in use, consist of two cells, each cell nominally 150 feet diameter by 22 feet high each. This design is used commercially for storage of water. After accounting for interior obstructions (support columns, drainwater collection systems, etc.) and the requirement for a 2-foot cold cap, the nominal volume of a cell is 2.9 Mgal. The current disposal cell being constructed, SDU-6 will be a 375-foot diameter 43-foot tall single-cell design. The unit will have a nominal volume of hold 32 Mgal. For every 10Mgal of disposal capacity, a leak detection system is required to monitor the disposal cell during operations.<br />In addition to the disposal cell, other infrastructure in necessary to connect to and operate with SPF.</p>
<p>This infrastructure known as balance of plant (BOP) includes:<br />&bull; Grout distribution system<br />&bull; Temperature monitoring<br />&bull; Drain water system<br />&bull; Power, Cameras, Lighting<br />&bull; Ventilation Skid<br />&bull; Modular Instrument/Electrical Equipment Skid (MIEES)<br />&bull; Tie-ins</p>
<p>2.1 Constraints</p>
<p>a. Design</p>
<p>Since the SDUs are meant to be the final disposition location for low level nuclear waste, there are a number of requirements that must be met to assure these disposal cells can safely contain Saltstone for the long term.</p>
<p>These requirements are as follows:<br />&bull; Seismic Design Category (SDC)-2 Limit State D criteria<br />&bull; Leak detection system for every 10 Mgal of disposal capacity<br />&bull; Roof thickness should be between 8 to 12 inches depending on the method to prevent long term water infiltration<br />&bull; Must pass fluorescent dye water tightness test with no visible fluorescence<br />&bull; Obtain construction permit from the State of South Carolina<br />&bull; Roof must have sufficient structural integrity to support BOP SSCs, penetrations, and allow personnel access for daily operational rounds and BOP maintenance<br />&bull; Individual SDU operational life (before closure cap is installed) 25 years<br />&bull; The Saltstone grout may include high levels of chemicals which may adversely affect the disposal cell (for example sulfates and sodium hydroxide)<br />&bull; Grout Temperature: 10&deg;C to 100&deg;C<br />&bull; Grout density is typically 1.76 g/ml<br />&bull; Relative humidity up to 100% condensing within disposal cell<br />&bull; SDU structure shall be able to withstand hydrostatic head created by internal liquids<br />&bull; Prevent rain or ground water infiltration<br />&bull; The disposition of a the total Saltstone volume must fit within the permitted boundary of the SDF</p>
<p>b. Schedule</p>
<p>The required SDU disposal volume is directly tied to the amount of salt waste processing performed by the LW system. Once SDU 6 is filled with Saltstone, the estimated yearly volume of generated Saltstone is expected to be is almost 15Mgal a year. The total estimated volume of Saltstone needed to complete the LW mission is about 200Mgal. Current forecast indicate that SDU 6 will be filled mid fiscal year (FY) 2020. Therefore, the next disposal cell or cells needs to be operational well before this time since the BOP takes about a year to complete after the disposal cell achieves its acceptance testing.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 DOE is seeking</p>
<p>The Department is seeking the following information to support its evaluation of the most cost effective SSC to safety contain and disposition Saltstone within aforementioned constraints.</p>
<p>The specific information sought includes:<br />&#61623; Recommend SSC(s) to contain and disposition Saltstone which includes<br />&#61607; Total cost (rough order of magnitude) - From design, site preparation, to construction completion<br />&#61607; Time frame<br />&#61623; Optimal disposal cell volume<br />&#61623; Recommended strategy for the life-cycle containment of Saltstone<br />&#61623; Other recommendations</p>
<p>1. A brief preliminary description of how the respondent will address the recommendations. The statement should be on 8.5" x 11 pages, be in a narrative form a font with appropriate graphics using Microsoft Word. Font size should be no smaller than 12 point.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to ChemoMetec, Gydevang 43, DK-3450 Allerod, Denmark to procure the following:</p>
<p>ISSO and 508 Compliance is Obtained through NHGRI.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. NucleoCounter&reg;, NC-3000 cademic package including: All developed assays, power cable, UL Power Supply, USB cable, Cleaning Kit and Free Software Updates; Item Number: 970-3002, Quantity: One Each.<br />2.

Warranty, Item Number: 983-3001, Quantity: One Each.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch/Molecular Genetics Section Investigators use a broad range of tools to understand how health and disease are related to genetic, genomic and metabolic variation. Investigators study a broad spectrum of disorders, from common diseases associated with common variants to the rarest diseases associated with uncommon, sometimes unique variants. Scientific Investigators sometimes study disorders that are not inherited at all, which are due to somatic mosaicism-a difference in genetic composition among cells in an individual. Additionally also study how the genome influences normal metabolic processes. MGMGB investigators apply tools ranging from high-throughput biology to clinical and animal research. A unifying theme in their research is that the human is the most complex, fascin MGMGB investigators use the rich resources and technologies of the Human Genome Project to develop more sophisticated ways of understanding pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of disease.ating and important system in which one can study the effects of heritable variation.<br /><br />For twenty years NHGRI have been engaged in a large collaborative study entitled FUSION (Finland - United States Investigation of NIDDM), in which more than 20,000 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (and suitable controls) from Finland are being studied. In addition we are involved in research on a rare prematurer aging disease, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) where children a born with a de novo mutation in the LMNA gene, display characteristics of aging at extremely early age and die of cardiovascular disease or stroke in their teenage years. Research in these areas contribute to the knowledge base of common disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide achieving epidemic proportion as well as gaining knowledge of the aging process which affects not only the rare cases as in HGPS but also insight into common aging in normal individuals.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>ChemoMetec NucleoCounter NC-3000 is an advanced cell analyzer utilizing fluorescence imaging to characterize cell properties. The NC-3000 can perform high speed cell count and viability determination and includes plug-and-play analytical assays of mammalian, yeast and insect cells. Pre-defined assays include a unique 5-minute cell cycle assay and a selection of apoptosis assays. FlexiCyte license allow users the ability to create protocols choosing light source, emission filters and detailed settings. The accompanying intuitive software can be used for data analysis of the results and has unlimited licenses. The NC-3000 benchtop image cytometer ensures flow-like analysis with high reproducibility and is maintenance and calibration free. The NC-3000 is capable of one-step viability and cell count without any pre-treatment utilizing the Via1-Cassette for viability and cell count determination. The inside of the Via1-Cassette is coated with the two fluorescent dyes acridine orange and DAPI automatically staining the total and dead cell populations, respectively. The Via1-Cassette is volume calibrated ensuring high precision viability and cell count determination.</p>
<p>The NC-3000 is capable of high speed viability and cell count of small sample volumes. The multi-chamber A8 slide enables high speed viability and cell count determinations of insect and mammalian cells with 8 counts in less than 3 minutes. Simply mix cell suspension with fluorescent dyes, load the chamber and press run. ChemoMetec offers optimized counting and viability protocols for even aggregated cells or cells growing on microcarriers or in sphere cultures. When counting manually the scientist can visually verify the counting. This verification of the count can likewise be performed with the intuitive NucleoView software included with the NC-3000. Scatterplots and plots are interlinked making it possible to verify cell populations visually.</p>

<SUBJECT>TESTING SERVICES FOR HERITABILITY STUDY: TEST 15 COMPOUNDS (+ VEHICLE CONTROL) ACROSS 16 DO NPC CELL LINES IN REPLICATE STUDIES
<SOLNBR>NIEHS2016NOI002

<CONTACT>Onyenauché Washington, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone (919) 541-0423, Email uche.washington@nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Predictive Biology Incorporated of Carlsbad CA for the purchase of "Heritability (HERIT16) testing", in support of a National Toxicology Program (NTP) project involving neuroprogenitor cells derived from diversity outbred mouse embryonic stem cells. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the offer and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380, "Testing Laboratories" with a size standard of $15.0M.
<p><br />The Contractor shall provide the NIEHS/DNTP/Biomolecular Screening Branch with information that will assist in the identification of genes that are responsible for differences in individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of chemical exposures. The Contractor shall test 28 flame retardants and other potentially toxic environmental chemicals for toxicity against 2 prototypical cell lines to screen for differential responses. Following the initial screen, a subset of chemicals exhibiting specific toxicity response patterns will be selected for testing against 16 genetically distinct cell lines to generate data that will allow identification of "toxicity-related" genes and signaling pathways. This is referred to as "Heritability (HERIT16) Testing" or genetically-controlled differential toxicity response determination. The goal is to estimate the heritability of compound response.</p>
<p>Humans demonstrate a broad range of variability in toxicity responses to environmental chemicals, and with humans being extremely genetically diverse, it is reasonable to assume that there are differences in toxicity responses result from genomic differences. This phenomenon has been demonstrated using a subset of chemicals from the Tox21 compound library to treat human lymphoblastoid cell lines from ~1000 individuals. However, in that study, the genetic differences responsible for the observed differential responses were not identified. The NIEHS/DNTP needs to identify the genes that are involved in these toxicity responses. To do so, the DNTP needs to use a mammalian model that has genetic variability rivaling or exceeding the variability that exists within the human population. Historically, the NTP has relied on the Diversity Outbred mouse model, developed at the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor ME. This mouse model has enabled the identification of genes and signaling pathways related to differences in benzene - associated toxicity, and the potential for establishing a more restrictive occupational exposure level for humans, based on identification of susceptible subpopulations based on genotype. However, rather than using whole animals (mice), the NTP will be using cell cultures derived from these Diversity Outbred mice to 1) save on study-related costs and 2) reduce reliance on animal testing. To this end, Predictive Biology, Inc., is the only company known to have these cell lines and a large repository of genetically diverse cells derived from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. A wide range of genetic diversity in a study population (in this case, cell lines) is necessary for generating data that can be used to identify the specific genes that are operational in a signaling pathway of interest, in response to chemical exposure. In addition to this, the use of cell lines rather than intact mice allows NTP to abide by the international recommendations to reduce and replace animals in toxicology research, and is also a much more economical approach to conducting this study.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 10 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Expression Analysis. There is no solicitation package available. The Contracting Officer for this requirement is Ms. Onyenauch&eacute; Washington. All questions or concerns relating to this notice shall be submitted by e-mail to uche.washington@nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised as a set aside for Small Business (FAR 52.219-6) concerns.  This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.

This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.
  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair within the NAICS code listed, primarily by design-build or secondarily by design-bid-build, of commercial and institutional buildings at various government installations located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California.

Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, armory, auditoriums, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQs), child care centers, fire stations, gymnasiums, hangars, hospitals, maintenance/repair facilities, warehouses, and other similar facilities.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million.
  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000.  Task orders will range between $8,000,000 and $15,000,000.  Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.
  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two:  Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 â€“ Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted.
 THE SOLICITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about December 21, 2015.

Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website address listed above.

A sources sought notice was posted on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement as a small business set-aside. The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) San Diego District Office and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice for notice of intent to award a sole source contract.  This is not a solicitation. The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate a sole source IDIQ contract for a 12 month base and (4) annual option years to obtain consultative services for VA VISN1 New England Medical Center laboratories for selected cytopathology and surgical pathology cases and selected clinical laboratory tests from Partners Healthcare, Brigham & Women's Hospital, 20 Shattuck St., Boston, MA 02115.  Due to the affiliate relationship with the VA Boston, Brigham & Women's expertise in kidney and muscle pathology as well as their ability to meet the need for the varied laboratory testing, many of which are time sensitive and require rapid turnaround, Brigham & Women's' Hospital is the only vendor that can meet this need.  Since the intent is to procure this on a sole source basis, no solicitation will be posted to FedBizOps (FBO).  The solicitation will be available to Brigham & Women's Hospital on or about 1/15/2016.  One response was received to the Sources Sought Notice published to FBO on 11/23/2015 under #VA241-16-Q-0087.  However, it was determined that the interested party would not be able to meet the rapid turnaround time requirements needed since their facility is not located within the necessary geographic proximity and they do not appear to have expertise in kidney and muscle pathology.  The types of biopsies to be tested during the performance of this procurement are fresh specimens that need to be transported to the receiving institution shortly after collection to preserve tissue integrity. The applicable NAICS code is 621511.  The FSC/PSC is Q515.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302.1-1 Only One Responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.    
Interested persons may contact the Contract Specialist via email at Valerie.DeAngelis@va.gov regarding this procurement.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>UC LBNL has proposed to replace the existing Building 37 cooling towers CT-100 and CT-101 (1000 tons each)  on the main LBNL Building 37 site. Building 37 is a utility support building that supports several scientific research buildings including the Building 6 (ALS) Advanced Light Source. The existing Building 37 cooling towers are of wood construction and in poor condition. The cooling towers have had some retrofits over the years but their structure is beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced. The scope of the proposed work is to replace the existing wood cooling towers with preferably stainless-steel cooling towers with vibration control. New Cooling Towers (1200 ton each) are to have the same or smaller footprint and less weight than the existing wood towers. Temporary cooling towers will be required during construction. The project also includes replacement of the five existing cooling tower pumps with six new pumps and installation of a new valve on existing CT water header piping. Project will need to proceed in multiple phases to maintain building operations and accommodate funding over two fiscal years. Development of a phasing schedule to accommodate existing user needs will be critical to maintain the ongoing operations for Building 37 users. Existing user operational requirements will be the priority in scheduling shutdowns and temporary cooling tower connections.

FAXES ARE NOT ACCEPTED</p>
<p><strong>D. Information:</strong></p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's medical research agency-making important discoveries that improve health and save lives. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) improves dental, oral, and craniofacial health through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information. This acquisition is to procure and upgrade of the existing Rees Scientific monitoring system and the services and materials for the continuation of the functioning of a scientific equipment freezer alarm system in Building 30 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This service provides vital protection of invaluable research specimens collected from research studies being conducted and/or sponsored by our NIDCR institute. NIDCR is in current need of upgrading and maintaining the existing Rees Scientific Monitoring system within its Bldg. #30 laboratories on the Bethesda, MD campus.</p>
<p>2. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to upgrade and maintain the current freezer alarm system in building 30. This is to ensure the system is up to date, and that future updates of the hardware and software which controls the alarm system as needed, will be able to be performed.</p>
<p>3. Project Requirements</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks/Deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Instillation and Upgrade of the current freezer alarm system: The alarm system insures the storage of research specimens at appropriately low temperatures. The freezer alarm protects the research specimens some of which are 50 years old and cannot be replaced. The alarm system currently covers 140 pieces of equipment, such as ultra-low freezers, cold rooms, cell culture incubators as well as other delicate and sensitive equipment. The alarm system includes at this time a computer system, wiring throughout Bldg. 30, and wireless V2 sensors in Bldg. #10. Note: One probe that is attached to each piece of equipment in the alarm system. The below instillation tasks are to be completed by March 31st, 2016.</p>
<p>i. The contractor shall review and upgrade existing system Centron structured query language (SQL) nodes (2), to the new Enterprise / Presidio monitoring system and software. Also upgrade of existing (16) MPX panels and ports to buffering networked panels. Upgrade to also include NIST calibration and testing of all 140 pieces of equipment, as well as V2 Nets and existing V2 transmitters. System will be a hard wired / wireless hybrid upgrade and must re-use all existing wiring, probes, and V2 wireless transmitters already in place.</p>
<p>ii. The contractor shall instillation qualification and operation qualification (IQ/OQ) all equipment to verify proper operation. Mount the main control panel, (Nodes) and any MPX buffered remote panels in areas designated by the customer unless such areas will prevent future service access, or expose the equipment to conditions that will affect the operation or reliability of the system.</p>
<p>iii. The contractor shall install (2) Enterprise node units that will provide up to 8 panels containing 16 ports each, giving a total of 128 ports for each system. This installation should be done in such a way as to allow the new Enterprise nodes to communicate with the current infrastructure existing in Bldg #30 (hard wired) and Bldg #10 (wireless). Personnel in Bldg #30 and in Bldg #10 should both be able to access their respective inputs on each screen.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall provide a comprehensive system testing to verify, calibrate, and document all system functions including readings, databases, alarms, dial-outs, outputs, reports, and user programming. An onsite service plan including approximately 100 page GMP/GLP IQ/OQ validation report, 1000 page software validation test report, calibration of temperature and humidity with traceable equipment, copies of reference equipment calibration certificates and onsite refresher training at PM visit.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>1. Validation Kit for Centron with Centron Presidio Software, Quantity: 10, Part Number: VAL-KIT-PRES<br />2. 3.6 volt Lithium Battery for V2 wireless transmitters, Quantity: 150, Part Number: V2-BATT<br />3. Battery for Micro Units &amp; MPX-RMT Remote Panels, Quantity: 18, Park Number: MICRO-BAT<br />4. 6 Volt 1.4 AMP battery, Quantity: 12, Part Number: BATT1001<br />5. Calibrated trade-out Oxygen-Room Sensor. Includes new O2 sensor head and calibration cert with return of existing sensor for reconditioning, Quantity: 5, Part Number: OXYGEN-ROOM-R</p>
<p>System Requirements:<br /><br />1. Enterprise includes RAID Dual Level Data Redundancy, true multi-user networking for 10 simultaneous users (expandable to 50) and access to the system via web browser software from PCs, Tablets or Smart Phones. Includes 1 telephone dialer with the capacity to accept up to 4 total dialers. Compatible with all versions of Rees wireless and buffering MPX-RMT panels<br />2. System must provide "BuddyWatch" feature. This node alarm feature provides alarm alerts in the event of catastrophic node or board failure of either system in network.<br />3. System must be capable of providing a pre-alarm notification feature that allows end-users to respond to potential alarm conditions before it's an actual logged event. <br />4. All wireless communications are 2.4 GHz Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum for vastly enhanced 2-way communication and reliability <br />5. All wireless sensors buffer 7 days of readings history recorded at 5 minute intervals.<br />6. Wireless sensors in a typical install will be battery powered with a 1.5 year battery.<br />7. The transmitters accept any type of Rees Scientific or industry standard input and provide 12 bit analog to digital conversion accuracy. Provide 1 input, 2 input and 4 input transmitters configurations<br />8. All wireless batteries are monitored, low batteries cause low battery alarms which can dial out.<br />9. All communications are monitored, error-checked, and corrected. Communications failures cause a communication failure alarm which can dial out. When communications are re-established, the 7 days of buffered data are automatically uploaded and put into the database.<br />10. Wireless sensors, when AC powered become repeaters for other sensors. If any repeater fails, the sensors will try connect to another repeater within range and "heal" the network. If communications problems exist in a network, plugging in additional sensors adds repeaters and resolves the problem.<br />11. Sensors must have a "ping test" mode which makes it very easy to map regions of good signal coverage. This ensures communications reliability when the system is installed.<br />12. The system shall be able to document the measurements of all probes for an indefinite amount of time within the system.</p>
<p>4. Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>1. All personnel involved in this project will be Rees Scientific employees, trained and certified to perform work on the subject system.<br />2. Contractor must be ISO 9001:2008 certified</p>
<p>5. Anticipated Period of Performance/Delivery Date</p>
<p>Task 1: Upgrade to be completed by March 31st, 2016</p>
<p>Task 2: Maintenance Services<br />Base Year: February 1st, 2016 - January 31, 2017 <br />Option Year 1: February 1st, 2017 - January 31, 2018<br />Option Year 2: February 1st, 2018 - January 31, 2019<br />Option Year 3: February 1st, 2019 - January 31, 2020<br />Option Year 4: February 1st, 2020 - January 31, 2021</p>

<DESC>Perform complete revegetation services on a closed low level and mixed waste radioactive landfill at the Nevada National Security Site. The landfill was closed with a soil cover in 2011 with the initial vegetation effort being completed in December of that year. Vegetation monitoring in May 2013 revealed that seed germination and plant establishment were below expectations. Since that time two additional test plots using seed were attempted without success. The landfill cover is required to be vegetated by the closure agreement with the state of Nevada. All information gathered during the previous efforts will be provided to the successful bidder, including soil analysis data from 2014.<br />The site is divided into 4 distinct but adjacent soil covers, totaling approximately 50 acres. The contract will consist of three task orders:
<p>1. Completion of a revegation plan to outline the most effective method to perform the revegetation. This study may include soil sampling and analysis, geotechnical analysis, or any other testing deemed necessary. <br />2. After the plan is complete and approved, revegetation of approximately 10 acres will be performed and evaluated. <br />3. Revegetation of the remaining portion of the site completed in the following season. Services are to include periodic monitoring to ensure that the vegetation is progressing as desired.<br />Revegetation should be accomplished with either seedling or transplants or a combination of both. Species are to be native to the area and chosen based on the specific site conditions. Typical species for the area are Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass), Ambrosia dumosa (white bursage), Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Atriplex confertifolia (shadscale), Baileya multiradiata (desert marigold), Elymus elymoides (squirreltail), Encelia farionosa (brittlebush), Ephedra nevadensis (Nevada ephedra), Larrea tridentata (creosote), and Sphaeralcea ambigua (desert globemallow).</p>
<p>Interested companies should respond within 7 days with a statement of capabilities/experience with this type of reuirement. Also provide point of contact information and business size IAW NAICS Code to Renee McDowell, <a href="mailto:mcdowear@nv.doe.gov">mcdowear@nv.doe.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>Document Number: 		SAQMMA-16-I-0014<br />Agency:  			U.S. Department of State<br />Office:   			Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Security Technology<br />Notice Type:  			Sources Sought/Request for Information
<p>1.0 Purpose</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as outlined in FAR 15.201(c) (7).  The purpose of this RFI is to accomplish market research pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, and to identify businesses capable of performing the functions described herein. The Government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting new service providers to support the requirements of the Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Office of Security Technology (ST), as described in this RFI. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation for the below-listed services in the future. Responders are advised that the government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate interested parties for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response.</p>
<p>Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>DS is the law enforcement and security arm of the DOS.  DS is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.  All Foreign Service posts (embassies, consulates-general, consulates, et al.) operate with technical and physical security programs designed and maintained by DS. ST's main purpose is ensuring overseas technical and physical security systems are installed, maintained, repaired, upgraded, and monitored.  These systems include an early warning system alerting personnel of impending attacks from rockets, artillery, or mortars in certain locations.</p>
<p>The current early-warning system known as Sense and Warn was developed by the Department of Defense (DOD) under the U. S. Army's Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) Program Directorate.  The DOS S&amp;W architecture has evolved into  a unique system of systems that integrates a command and control (C2) system, AN/TPQ-49 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radars, Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam (GAMB) radars, a communication network, and a commercial off-the shelf (COTS) audio and visual warning system. The current S&amp;W C2 has reached the end of its life cycle and must be replaced with a system that meets the specialized requirements of the DOS Sense and Warn program office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.0 Prerequisites</p>
<p>At this time, there is no requirement for a facility security clearance or cleared staff under the National Industrial Security Program. However, if a respondent participates in the National Industrial Security Program and has facility and personnel clearances, please provide that information in the response. The company must be willing to provide technical assistance during the installation of the system as well as telephone/email based technical support for at least one year after installation.</p>
<p>4.0  Requirements</p>
<p>4.1  The S&amp;W C2 system shall consist of the following:</p>
<p>a.	S&amp;W C2 application software<br />b.	Rack mountable central processing unit and laptop version of the Man-Machine Interface  (MMI) to permit for remote operator interface and display<br />c.	Deployable transit case <br />d.	IP network interface for connection with existing S&amp;W communication IP based networks<br />e.	Uninterrupted power supply with self-sensing 110VAC or 220VAC input<br />f.	Cables and other connecting hardware</p>
<p>4.2  The S&amp;W C2 system shall perform the following functions:</p>
<p>a.	Interface, collect, and exchange rocket, artillery, and  mortar (RAM) data with the GAMB and the AN/TPQ-49 LCMR systems <br />b.	Accept network time synchronization from a standard NTP server<br />c.	Provide threat evaluation of rockets, artillery, or Mortars (RAM) for analysis, distribution, and situational awareness information<br />d.	Threat correlation to assess and verify RAM events in order to initiate a timely warning. Only after a RAM event has been correlated can an autonomous warning be initiated<br />e.	Automated and manual alert management<br />f.	Provide a scalable integrated surveillance picture <br />g.	Provide tools for planning, configuration, and evaluation of the S&amp;W system performance<br />h.	Graphical user interface (GUI) technology that uses mil-standard symbols and graphics<br />i.	Integrate with the Eaton's Cooper Industries Wireless Audio Visual Emergency System  (WAVES) mass notification system<br />j.	Integrated with the Federal Selectone 300VSC-IP (via SNMPv2,v3) notification system<br />k.	Data recording and playback features to allow the user to create post- incident forensics reports and retrieve historical data, such as alerts and operator actions for up to 96 hours<br />l.	Computer-based training modules that replicate multiple sensor tracks and simulate a real-world environment<br />m.	Plug into existing S&amp;W IP based communications network equipment <br />n.	A mapping tool for the real time display that uses standard US digital mapping formats, i.e. CADRG, CIB, and DTED. <br />o.	The system must be adaptable, scalable and tailorable to allow the integration of future CTA sensors or other sensors such as small arms detection systems.</p>
<p>5.0 Summary of Requirements</p>
<p>The Department is seeking a C2 solution to replace the current S&amp;W C2 system. The C2 solution sought must integrate, aggregate, analyze, correlate and display rocket, artillery, or mortar indirect fire data provided by counterfire target acquisition radars in order to trigger an audio and visual warning to personnel of imminent attack.  The C2 must interface with the GAMB Radar and AN/TPQ-49 radar for the sense function. The C2 system must warn through interfaces to the WAVES and SelecTone alerting subsystems. The C2 system must display a single integrated threat picture and initiate timely threat alerting.  The system must be adaptable, scalable and tailorable in order to provide a foundation for future integration of new detection technology or data sources. The C2 system must be capable of utilizing existing S&amp;W commercially-available communications network components.</p>
<p>6.0 Instructions</p>
<p>Responses must be limited to 25 pages or less and be submitted in Microsoft Word or Portable Document format (PDF), using Times New Roman 12-point font. The Government will not entertain telephone calls or questions for this RFI. The responses should be in the following format/order:</p>

<DESC>WORK TYPE: DESIGN-BUILD / CONSTRUCTION<br />Provide all site investigations, workplans, site surveys, studies and design analysis, design drawings and specifications, construction documents, shop and manufacturing drawings, materials, labor, equipment, supervision, testing, submittals, and construction to<br />perform the requirements of this project to make the necessary repairs and rehabilitation services in accordance with the provided scope of work and contract documents. The prime contractor shall be required to coordinate with Government Representatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, under the direction of the Contracting Officer (KO) and assigned representatives of the contract. Construction shall commence under the direction of the KO after the work plan(s) and associated shop drawings are completed,<br />reviewed, and approved in writing that the workplan(s) and shop drawings have demonstrated they meet the contract requirements. The intent of the project is to replace a section of the Sheppard Air Force Base (AFB) 15kV class electrical distribution system (specifically all of Circuit 6). This work includes conversion of overhead<br />(OH) to underground (UG) and replacement of UG electrical primary and secondary service. The finished system shall be 500 kcmil service. Provide the new UG feeder and taps before removing the existing OH and UG feeder and taps to minimize (to the maximum extent possible) the outage(s) associated with replacing Circuit<br />6. Construct the new UG feeder primary and secondary to include street and parking lot lighting. Demolish the existing OH and UG. Existing ground transformers will be replaced as well as main circuit breakers and switches. Work will also require provision of spare underground ducts and provision for metering. Underground road boring with steel casings is required, but pavement cutting will be considered for government approval in specific situations. The design phase shall determine the best method of accomplishing the replacement of this feeder which consists of approximately 3 miles of OH distribution and approximately 3.6 miles of UG distribution. Both the design and the construction shall be handled under the auspices of one prime contractor that shall be responsible for completing the work. It is the prime contractor's option to subcontract the design and/or construction phase as long as the design is<br />stamped by a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) experienced in &lsquo;15kV Class Distribution System' design and the construction is accomplished by a contractor experienced in &lsquo;15kV Class Line Construction' work. The PE that stamps the design shall be the Designer of<br />Record (DOR). The DOR shall submit his or her design experience for evaluation and shall have a minimum of 5 documented &lsquo;15kV Class Distribution System Modification' projects of similar scope (of which 3 must be designed within the last 5 years). The construction contractor shall submit its construction experience for evaluation and shall have a minimum of 5 years documented &lsquo;15kV Class Line Construction' experience of similar scope (of which 3 must be successfully completed within the last 5 years).<br />The replacement of Circuit 6 shall be accomplished with a minimum of power outage(s). To assist in achieving that requirement, the new UG distribution must be constructed and tested to the maximum extent possible prior to demolishing the existing OH and UG distribution. All outages shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officer (KO) in advance and shall be scheduled through the Sheppard AFB Base Civil Engineer (BCE).<br />The principal elements of the project are:<br />1. Perform required site visit(s) to verify work required according to the documents provided<br />2. Design and Workplan developments<br />3. Construction Management<br />4. Overhead Electrical Distribution Demolition<br />5. Underground Electrical Distribution Replacement<br />6. New Underground Electrical Distribution Work<br />7. Street Lighting<br />8.

Individuals or groups who responded to UTM09032014 do not need to resubmit to this notice. <p> NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), is hereby requesting information through this notice from interested parties for the following: NASAs Safe Autonomous Systems Operations (SASO) Project seeks to identify U.S.-based public, private, and academic organizations to collaborate with NASA to conduct Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and UAS Traffic Management (UTM) research and development with the collective goal of safely enabling these operations at lower altitudes by UTM system. The collaboration will involve a series of UTM builds with evolving complexity. This notice also solicits interested parties' questions, comments, suggestions, clarifications, and any data that would help the agency prepare for such collaboration. There will be no funds exchanged between NASA and collaborating parties. <p> Potential collaborators who may consider responding include: <p> 	UAS manufacturers, 	Personal aircraft vehicle manufacturers, 	UAS avionics and middleware industry representatives, 	UAS operators: Cargo Delivery, Precision Agriculture, and others 	UAS start up and mature companies, 	Software companies supporting UAS operations, 	Sensor manufacturers, 	Communication/navigation/surveillance providers, 	System integrators, 	Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) UAS test sites, 	Universities, academicians, researchers, 	Satellite communication, surveillance, tracking systems industry, 	System integrators, 	UAS Mission planning software systems, 	Ground station system developers, and 	Others who have capabilities to enable low altitude airspace operations. <p> The final product of these tests will result in a working prototype UTM system and documentation of results that demonstrate how the low-altitude airspace and UAS operations could be safely enabled for the entire stakeholder community and national benefit.  <p> BACKGROUND <p> The goals of the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) include enabling low-altitude airspace and UAS operations. Stakeholders at the UTM workshop held in February 2014 discussed the need for airspace management system automation, procedures, rules, and regulations to safely enable low-altitude airspace and UAS operations. NASAs research and development activity, UTM, addresses this critical gap.  <p> For the purposes of this document, UTM is focused on low-altitude (AGL 2000 feet and below) in Class G airspace. <p> ARMDs Airspace Operations and Systems Program plans to conduct simulations and field tests of increasingly sophisticated UTM builds to enable diverse vehicles, operations, and scenarios/missions at these altitudes. This research will require collaborating with many entities such as manufacturers; operators that include retailors, search and rescue, firefighting, science, academia, etc.; communication, navigation, and surveillance system designers, airspace system developers, system integrators, FAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), FAA test sites, etc. <p> BENEFITS <p> The product of these field tests will be beneficial to all collaborating parties, NASA researchers, the FAA, the NOAA and National Weather Service (NWS), academia, UAS manufacturers and applications industry, avionics industry, and policy makers. <p> Collaborating parties receive valuable performance data about their assets and ability to operate in the mixed airspace. <p> NASA will test the algorithms and UTM capabilities to safely enable low altitude operations and operational requirements for wind/weather integration, airspace design/geo-fencing, sense-and-avoid/separation management, demand/capacity imbalance management, contingency management, and enabling requirements such as communications, navigation, and surveillance. <p> Policy makers receive data to support the understanding of procedures, safety processes, and options for safe management of the low altitude airspace. <p> UTM BUILD EVOLUTION APPROACH <p> The UTM builds will begin with baseline functionality and then evolve. Below are a series of anticipated nominal builds, where the functionality and scope will be adjusted as needed to accommodate stakeholder interests. <p> UTM Build 1: Goal is to show information that will affect the UAS trajectories 1.	Geo-fencing and airspace design 2.	Methods for establishing and maintaining UTM airspace (e.g. Open and close airspace decision based on the weather/wind forecast) 3.	Separation/collision avoidance procedures and techniques for UAS within UTM airspace 4.	Basic scheduling of vehicle trajectories 5.	Terrain/man-made objects database to verify obstruction-free initial trajectory <p> UTM Build 2: Goal is to make dynamic adjustments and contingency management 1.	All functionality from Build 1 2.	Dynamically adjust availability of airspace 3.	Demand/capacity imbalance prediction and adjustments to scheduling of UAS where the expected demand is very high 4.	Management of contingencies  lost link, inconsistent link, vehicle failure <p> UTM Build 3: Goal is to manage separation/collision by vehicle and/or ground-based capabilities 1.	All functionality from Build 2 2.	Active monitoring of the trajectory conformance inside geo-fenced area and any dynamic adjustments 3.	UTM web interface, which could be accessible by all other operators (e.g., helicopter, general aviation, etc.) 4.	Management of separation of heterogeneous mix (e.g., prediction and management of conflicts based on predetermined separation standard) <p> UTM Build 4: Goal is to manage large-scale contingencies 1.	All functionality of Build 3 2.	Management of large-scale contingencies such as all-land scenario <p> Table 1 (attached) shows the anticipated field tests and demonstration spirals. Multiple or repeated runs of the same build could be tested over multiple days to accommodate interest and diversity of vehicles and operations. <p> ASSUMPTIONS <p> Interested parties can assume the following: <p> 1.	NASA will lead the development of the test schedule and test matrix.   NASAs goal is to conduct tests that are diverse in nature, both in terms of vehicle capabilities and applications. NASA will coordinate with the FAA for information and technology assessments. 2.	The more the credible number of collaborators, the richer and more representative the tests, data, and results will be. Therefore, NASA has not a-priori set a limit on the number of collaborators. 3.	All vehicles will have to go through the NASA Airworthiness process and/or demonstrate proof of process and airworthiness review conducted by the vehicle manufacturer or operator. 4.	NASA will bear the costs involved in logistics of the conducting tests, data collection, analysis, and report generation as well as UTM build development.  However, NASA will not be acquiring or paying for the UAS, collaborating partys personnel involved in preparation of the tests, and activities associated with collaboration. 5.	NASAs Office of Chief Counsel will require each collaborating party to sign a Release Form. Generally, the Release Form will require collaborating parties to waive all claims against the U.S. Government and to indemnify the U.S. Government against third-party claims, for all NASA-sponsored activities during the UTM collaboration. The Release Form will also address the release of UTM test data to collaboration parties and the protection of collaborating parties proprietary data. 6.	Collaborating parties will be required to provide proof of insurance having reasonable coverage amounts set by NASA. Also, collaborating parties will assume liability for any damage and injuries caused by their personnel or equipment. 7.	Depending on the business use/missions/scenarios, some vehicles and associated missions may not be used in these collaborative tests.	 8.	Tests will be conducted at locations that are legally acceptable for the UTM testing.  9.	Based on the test conditions and vehicle/scenario mix, NASA (and support contractors) will request Certificate of Authorization (COA) to conduct these tests.  10.	NASA will develop UTM builds that will be incorporated in the field-testing. Further, NASA may use live, virtual, constructive environment to increase the complexity of the test conditions and scenarios. 11.	NASA (or NASA-appointed contractors) will collect data and results related to UTM, which will be shared with all stakeholders that are involved in the study.  Common data regarding overall results of the test will be shared with the FAA and all participants in the test. Vehicle or proprietary capability-specific data (e.g., accuracy of flying trajectories) will be provided only to the collaborating party responsible for that vehicle or capability. 12.	NASA will be the arbiter for balancing the needs of various stakeholders. 13.	As needed, further tests involving the models of cities or urban areas will be created and tested.  <p> RESPONSES <p> Interested parties are requested to respond to this notice with an information package. The information packages may be submitted at any time while this notice is active and shall be submitted via email only to <a href="mailto:parimal.h.kopardekar@nasa.gov">parimal.h.kopardekar@nasa.gov </a> , <a href="mailto:helen.e.yamamoto@nasa.gov">helen.e.yamamoto@nasa.gov </a> , and <a href="mailto:bethany.a.mcclave@nasa.gov">bethany.a.mcclave@nasa.gov </a> .

<DESC>The following limited sources justification is posted in compliance with FAR 5.301 and FAR 8.405-6(a)(2).
The redacted limited sources justification is also attached in FedConnect in pdf form.

Limited Sources Justification
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY DE-DT0004091 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity
The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. DOE Headquarters Procurement Services (MA-64) will execute the action. This document sets forth the justification and approval for the use of one of the exceptions to full and open competition under the FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), ?In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures.? This contract action will be conducted under the authority of the General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple-Award Schedule (MAS) Program. 
2.	The nature and/or description of the action being approved
This justification authorizes and approves the sole source, time and materials award of an additional twelve months (in the form of one, 6-month option and two, 3-month options) to task order DE-DT0004091. The award will be made to the current contractor, TechSource, Inc. against its GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract number GS-00F-003DA to ensure continued technical engineering services support to the NE Office of Fuel Cycle Technologies (NE-5). The experimental neutrino transmutation research project currently underway under DE-DT0004091 cannot be stopped midstream and restarted without losing continuity, reactor facility use, and key graduate student personnel. The project is scheduled to run through the High Flux Isotope Reactor (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) operating schedule until the end of May 2016, after which detailed data analysis is required to reach the final results. The reactor will not be available for this work after May 2016. Without measurements in contin uous sequence with the reactor-on and reactor-off, the project goals of measuring the lifetime reduction effect along with the quantifying systematic errors will not be possible. The project would have to start over from the beginning, resulting in unnecessary cost to the Government.
The maximum period of performance of this additional period for DE-DT0004091 is 12 months, comprised of one, 6-month option and two, 3-month options. The option structure has been selected to provide the maximum flexibility in completing the research projects and transitioning to a new, competitively awarded vehicle.
DE-DT0004091 was competed in 2012 under FAR Subpart 8.4 and will expire on 12/29/2015. MA-64 is currently working with NE-5 to conduct a competitive follow-on procurement, which is anticipated to be awarded no later than the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2017. 
3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs.
TechSource Inc. currently provides technical engineering services to NE-5 under DE-DT0004091. The awarded scope includes the following services: (1) Systems analysis of proposed process systems; (2) Fuel cycle evaluation and screening: (3) Planning, development, and establishment of an internal review and evaluation capability for all programs, to objectively assess planning, research, and development, and technical demonstrations; (4) Review, evaluation, and development of plans and strategies for integration of nuclear programs; (5) Development and continuous improvement of program control procedures, program plans and strategies, and resolution of program reasonableness issues; and (6) Facilitation and participation in review of National Laboratory, university and industrial nuclear energy research project proposals and progress reports and development of recommendations for DOE managers on the value of the research and whether to start or continue funding projects. 
Specifically, NE-5 requires award of a logical follow-on to De-DT0004091 to make sure current work under the task order is completed without losing progress already made in research efforts. NE-5 estimates that the current research under this task order will be completed no later than the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2017. The estimated value of this logical follow-on is [redacted], as shown below. 
Period	Estimated Value Base (6-month)	[redacted] Option Period 1 (3-month)	[redacted] Option Period 2 (3-month)	[redacted] TOTAL	[redacted]
4.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
Orders placed under the GSA FSS are exempt from the competition requirements in FAR Part 6. However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration of FSS contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.This justification is executed under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program, specifically the authority granted by FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), ?In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures?.
DE-DT0004091 was competed as a small business set-aside under GSA Schedule 871 in the third quarter of FY 2012. Two proposals were received, and the proposal of TechSource, Inc. was determined to be the best value for the Government.
NE, in conjunction with the contract specialist and contracting officer, has determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to award a logical follow-on to the incumbent contractor to complete research work in progress. Award of a logical follow-on will capitalize on time and financial investment already made into the research work. If a logical follow-on award is not permitted, a new company would have to begin the research independently, wasting previous investment and seriously delaying the use of research results by NE. Transition of the DE-DT0004091 scope before this critical research is completed would cause disruption to NE?s mission and would result in an increased cost to achieve the end goal. 
TechSource, Inc. remains a small business under NAICS code 541330 Engineering Services, which has a small business size standard of $15 million.
5.	A statement demonstrating the unique qualifications of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority. 
Under the previously described scope, the current contractor provides Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) that support NE?s Office of Fuel Cycle Technologies in the following areas: Advanced Fuel Cycle fuels and materials; Materials Protection Accountability and Control; Separations and Waste Forms; and Nuclear Fuel Storage Systems. The SMEs provide their technical expertise in the areas below:
?	Develop and demonstrate technologies to:
o	Reduce the environmental and financial burden and uncertainty associated with long-term nuclear waste management. o	Optimize nuclear waste management. o	Recover the unused value of materials separated from used nuclear fuel for future use. o	Ensure the ability to safeguard the advanced fuel cycle technologies as well as development of next-generation technologies to support future deployments. o	Make the closed fuel cycle as cost effective as possible. o	Accelerate deployment of small modular reactors that are safe and economical. o	Support the establishment of a regulatory framework for licensing and permitting of new reactor concepts and fuel cycle facilities.
?	Develop the research and development infrastructure needed to mature nuclear energy technologies to the engineering-scale.
?	Support the development of personnel who will be needed to staff industry, regulators, government, universities and national laboratories to allow future sustainable fuel cycles in the United States and reinvigorate United States? global technological leadership.
The majority of the work under DE-DT0004091 is on-going research projects that cannot be transferred to a new contractor. As TechSource, Inc. assisted in the design and implementation of this research, it is uniquely qualified to complete the current research projects and provide the data results to the Government. The research projects are anticipated to be completed no later than the first quarter of FY17. The Government will not be able to complete necessary research activities without award of a logical follow-on to the incumbent contractor. Failure to allow for a logical follow-on award will result in loss of investment already made in current research efforts. 
6.	A description of efforts to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. 
The award of this logical follow-on action will be publicized via posting to FedBizOpps in accordance FAR 8.404(g)(2)(i) and FAR 5.301. Additionally, this Limited Sources Justification will be posted in accordance with FAR 8.404(g)(2)(ii). 
No additional sources were sought for this specific action, as it is critical that the research projects under this task order be completed by TechSource, Inc. MA-64 is currently working with NE to prepare a competitive follow-on acquisition that will include the general scope of this task order. The solicitation for the competitive follow-on is anticipated to be posted in the second quarter of FY 2016. 
7.	Cite the anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition including options if applicable and a determination by the Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d):
In accordance with FAR 8.404(d) ?GSA has already determined the price of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under the schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by FAR 8.405-2(d)? which consists of an evaluation of the level of effort and the mix of labor categories proposed.  Additionally, although by placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in 8.405, DOE has concluded that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR 2.101) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government?s needs, DOE will seek additional discounts consistent with FAR 8.405-4.
The total estimated value for this logical follow-on is [redacted]. The estimated value is determined fair and reasonable based upon comparison of TechSource, Inc. GSA FSS labor rates to historical rates and the independent Government cost estimate as well as comparison to other contractor rates for similar labor categories. 
8.	A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. Do not simply refer to the sources sought synopsis. 
Currently, TechSource, Inc. is the only company that is capable of completing the necessary research work in support of NE?s mission without a significant and damaging lapse in service. NE is working with MA-64 to compete a replacement contract that includes the general scope of this award. The competed follow-on contract is expected to be awarded no later than the first quarter of FY 2017. 
9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:
None.
10.	 A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed a written interest in the acquisition. 
None.
11.	A statement of actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition if subsequent acquisitions are anticipated. 
The agency does not foresee any barriers to competition, as the follow-on requirement is expected to be competed using full and open competition.
&#8195; 12.	Certification 
The information contained in this Limited Sources Justification is certified accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) announcement to be used for preliminary market research purposes only. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is issuing this request for information (RFI) announcement as part of a market survey for expedient repair technologies for damaged and/or deteriorated timber and concrete piles that are part of overwater pier/wharf structures. Piles are damaged/deteriorated from outside influences such as marine organisms, rot, and impact, resulting in reduced load allowances and usability for the pier structure. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies such as pile jacketing can provide a quick and less costly alternative to pile replacement in these situations. While jacketing is specifically mentioned, any other technologies that can expediently reinforce a pile back to its original structural capacity are also of interest.</p>
<p>High priority attributes for the repair technologies are:<br />&bull; Ability to rapidly restore the pile's axial- and flexural capacities<br />&bull; Speed and ease of installation<br />&bull; Low logistics for tools and materials<br />&bull; Time from installation to achieving full pile capacity<br />&bull; Functional in both fresh- and saltwater environments<br />&bull; Adaptability of the repair method to varied pile sizes, shapes, materials, and levels of degradation<br />&bull; Shelf life of repair materials</p>
<p>This RFI addresses requirements for military expeditionary operations and thus has several unique aspects:<br />&bull; Repair of damage is only required for a 3- to 10-feet length of pile within the surf zone;<br />i.e. full-length repair to the mud line is not required.<br />&bull; Restitution of structural capacity is the priority. Protection from deleterious effects such as water penetration, rot, or marine borers is secondary priority.<br />&bull; Longevity of the repair beyond 3 months is not a priority.</p>
<p>Interested organizations having applicable mature technologies for these purposes are invited to submit a White Paper as described below. After review of the white paper submissions, the Government may contact respondents for additional information.</p>
<p>DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION PAPERS<br />ONLY. No contracts will be awarded based on this announcement.</p>
<p>Select respondents may be invited to demonstrate their technologies in a controlled field setting. From this controlled setting, materials/methods will be further down selected for a demonstration in operational conditions.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: A white paper in the general form as described below is requested.</p>
<p>Section A: CONTACT INFO - Interested organizations should respond by providing the Government the following information; point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, duns number, cage code and or tax ID number, as well as size category (large, small, small disadvantaged, etc.)</p>
<p>Section B: COMPANY INFO - A brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, and related pile repair experience. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must meet these criteria.</p>
<p>Section C: PRODUCT DESCRIPTION- the White Paper should provide a detailed description of the proposed technology with specific emphasis on the high-priority attributes previously listed and the following criteria as applied to timber and/or concrete piles.</p>
<p>Section C-1: STRUCTURAL CAPACITY RESTORATION - Describe mechanics of the repair that provide strength increase; i.e. confined grout with added steel reinforcement; fiber- reinforced polymer jacket with confined fiber-reinforced cementitious material, etc. Include any supporting computational and/or laboratory and field load testing data.</p>
<p>Section C-2: INSTALLATION - Describe in detail the installation procedures. Address important parameters such as: Length of time for installation; required surface preparation; specialized curing requirements; required tools and equipment; required personnel and level of training/experience for personnel; availability of training materials; installation ability over water (i.e. from a floating surface) and in tight spaces (i.e. underneath pier structures); and ability to install below- or partially below the water surface?</p>
<p>Section C-3: SHELF LIFE OF REPAIR MATERIALS Describe estimated shelf life of all repair materials and any specialized storage/handling requirements to ensure shelf life.</p>
<p>Section C-4: ADAPTABILITY - Include information regarding the adaptability of the repair method to difference pile sizes, shapes, and material. Include information about the range of pile damage lengths the repair can handle. Is the method adaptable to multiple pile types or are different materials needed?</p>
<p>Section D: TECHNICAL DATA - Describe the other pertinent technical data here, such as typical cost-per-pile and longevity of repairs. Explain any aspects of the technology that could potentially be altered to better meet high-priority criteria (such as repair time and logistics) at the possible expense of lower-priority items (such as longevity of repair).</p>
<p>Section E: ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; SAFETY -State what safety equipment is required during the application of the material. State any environmental impact considerations. Describe the mixing requirements and any other pertinent safety information, if available. Provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for the product(s).</p>
<p>Section F: TRANSPORTATION - Describe any existing procedures or approvals for transporting the materials in bulk quantities.</p>
<p>Section G: AVAILABILITY - Discuss the material availability, assuming a onetime order for individual constituents and equipment. Is this material at technical- and manufacturing readiness levels sufficient for immediate purchase or is additional developmental testing and safety certification needed?</p>
<p>Section H: FEDERAL CONTRACTS - Please note related federal contracts including point of contact, current telephone number, and address.</p>
<p>Section I: PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES - Provide references for past installation and performance histories. Included point of contact, current telephone number, and address.</p>
<p>Section J: LITERATURE - Provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, research, etc.</p>
<p>White Paper responses to this notice are due within 30 days of the publication of this notice. After review of the submitted white papers, candidate technologies displaying expeditionary capabilities will be invited to demonstrate their capability in a controlled field setting. Any sample material and/or product demonstrations associated with this effort will be at the expense of the participating organizations (excluding expenses associated with Government personnel attending any demonstrations). Any materials provided must be within the stated shelf life. No support of transporting hazards materials of any kind is associated with this notice.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

<DESC>Statement of Work- SOLE SOURCE TO GEXPRO <br />GEXPRO Cimplicity and GE PPMS Support Renewal
<p><br />1. Background:<br /><br />1.1 GEXPRO as a representative of GE Intelligent platforms is the creator and customization entity of the Part Program Management Server, Cimplicity, and Part Program Transfer component that Watervliet Arsenal uses to manage the transfer and version checking of part programs from the Programmer to the Machine Tool.</p>
<p>2. Applicable Documents: See Proposal</p>
<p>3. Scope/Objective:</p>
<p>3.1 Provide software support for GE PPMS and Cimplicity software<br />4. Requirements:<br />4.1 Quarterly System Checks<br />At the start of the project, a GEIP consultant will spend 1 day on site to conduct a system<br />health check. Upon request by Watervliet Arsenal, GEIP will perform up to three additional<br />health checks (one in each of the three quarters following the start of the project). During<br />the system health checks, the consultant will review SQL Server logs and a subset of the<br />CIMPLICITY system logs (one quarter of the CIMPLICITY systems will be reviewed during each<br />visit). The consultant will correct issues or advise the Watervliet Arsenal as appropriate.<br />Dates for the system health checks will be arranged between the Arsenal and the GEIP<br />project manager.</p>
<p>4.2 24-Hour Response to System Shutdowns<br />This deliverable provides for 24-hour response to begin problem resolution of critical issues<br />that prevent the system from operating. For example, the inability to download Part<br />Programs to one or more machine would fall into this category.<br />During normal GEIP business hours (8AM to 5PM, Monday - Friday excluding GEIP Holidays),<br />the Watervliet Arsenal may call a designated GEIP support engineer directly. During other<br />times, support calls will be directed to the GEIP GlobalCare Helpdesk who will forward the<br />calls to the assigned CIMPLICITY Solution Consultant.</p>
<p>4.3 48-Hour Response to Support Calls<br />This deliverable provides for 48-hour response to begin problem resolution of non-critical<br />issues. Support calls by the Watervliet Arsenal will be directed to the GEIP Global Customer<br />Care Helpdesk who will forward the call to the assigned CIMPLICITY Solution Consultant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.4 GlobalCare Complete Support<br />This proposal includes twelve months of GlobalCare Complete Support for the CIMPLICITY<br />software installed at the Watervliet Arsenal. GEIP's proposal for GlobalCare Complete<br />Support includes coverage for:<br />&bull; Eleven (11) CIMPLICITY 150 Point Runtime licenses<br />&bull; Five (5) CIMPLICITY HMI Viewer Runtime System licenses<br />&bull; One (1) Unlimited Development CIMPLICITY license<br />Please see the tables in the next section for license quantity/type details.<br />GlobalCare Complete Support provides basic technical phone support and access to version<br />upgrades for a period of one year. Please refer to the attached brochure for information<br />5. Period of Performance on this maintenance contract shall be for a one year period.<br />6. Watervliet Technical Point of Contact is John Baxter, 518-266-4365.</p>

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer.

<p>Non-USPS mail such as Fedex, UPS and other private carriers please use Rockville, MD 20850.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation: No. N02CO01416-24 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-85 (December 2015) simplified procedures for commercial items.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System code is 511210 and the business size standard is $38.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract with a base plus four option periods.</p>
<p>I. Description of Requirement</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) administers the NCI Clinical Trials Network and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network programs for the performance of cancer treatment and prevention trials. The NCI Clinical Trials Network is comprised of four adult clinical trial organizations and one pediatric organization. The Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network is comprised of investigators who conduct clinical trials funded by grant mechanisms. The NCI Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) reviews NCI-sponsored studies selected by CTEP for human subjects' protections. Site Membership and participation in the CIRB is initiated, tracked and maintained via IRBManager&copy;. The tool assists the CIRB in assuring that regulatory and human subjects protection requirements are met.</p>
<p>The CIRB is one of the largest, if not the largest, publically-funded Central IRBs in the U.S. <br />Over 1,000 research sites participate in the CIRB; consequently, the support tool must be able to do more than routine IRB Operations Office processes but must be able to support a Central IRB. This requires a tool that can communicate with participating institutions for enrollment, local context submissions, and opening studies. The tool must have a prior track record of supporting other Central IRBs because this project, while fully functioning, is still growing.</p>
<p>IRB Manager is a software product utilized by the Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) to capture and track site participation in the initiative to meet regulatory and human subject protection requirements. IRB Manager has been tailored to the unique needs of the NCI CIRB and has been integrated with other NCI systems. The CIRB has been accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP). AAHRPP accreditation of the NCI CIRB was based in part on the use of best practices and systems including a customized and integrated version of IRB Manager.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for:<br />&bull; Providing license, hosting and maintenance for a production and test instance of Base Product</p>
<p>&bull; Providing license, hosting and maintenance for a production and test instance of a Reporting Server</p>
<p>&bull; Provide approximately 60hrs/yr of IT support for system enhancements, customization.</p>
<p>&bull; If the system is not integrated with other NCI systems at the time of award then provide 1 FTE in contract year 1 and 0.5 FTE in contract year 2 to integrate with other NCI systems including but not limited to CIRB Website, CTSU's Regulatory Support Service (RSS) and CTEP's Identity and Access Management (IAM).</p>
<p>In order to meet current and anticipated needs, the following must be provided:</p>
<p>1) Must be a fully web-based database designed to:<br />&bull; Manage all the aspects of CIRB-related information.</p>
<p>&bull; Remind the CIRB administrators of tasks at hand.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate with the local institutions, local investigators and Board members through a common base of information, document generation, document attachments and event tracking.</p>
<p>2) Must allow users to: <br />&bull; Enter protocols and protocol related information such as: investigator, site (supports multiple sites/investigators/research staff), reviewers, events, sponsor/funding source, title, grants manager, category of the study, attachments, approval dates, descriptions, comments, generated documents and statuses.</p>
<p>&bull; Attach documents.</p>
<p>&bull; Create events associated with either an individual site in a study or all the sites participating in the study</p>
<p>3) Able to customize changes including: <br />&bull; Unique user-defined fields, events, event steps, and reports</p>
<p>&bull; Web services to consume and exchange data almost instantaneously between the CIRB website and database, and NCI's Clinical Trial Support Unit (CTSU) and Regulatory Support System (RSS) database, thus supporting:</p>
<p>o Pre-enrollment and enrollment functions involving institution and person roster information;</p>
<p>o Study determination documentation and institution study-specific approvals to RSS for internal processing and public display on the CTSU website</p>
<p>&bull; Send study review outcome data and institution-specific CIRB coverage confirmations to CTSU.</p>
<p>&bull; Utilize the NCI's Identity and Access Management (IAM) for system access.</p>
<p>&bull; Populate with institutions and person data from RSS to create the appropriate institution-specific person associations.</p>
<p>&bull; Customize forms designed to capture local context information for signatory institutions and principal investigators, new study coverage requests, study closure/IRB transfer requests, locally developed materials, and unanticipated problems/serious noncompliance issues as well as a secured loop for document submission, CIRB Operations Office review, and Board determination.</p>
<p>4) Ensure system availability and data integrity including:<br />&bull; Ensure that systems are backed up routinely. The Contractor shall have a process to minimize risk of data loss and disruption of operations.</p>
<p>&bull; Work together with NCI to determine the frequency of the back-up schedule and identify back-up prioritization, as both are dependent on the criticality of the system data for each application.</p>
<p>&bull; Store and rotate back-up tapes to maximize data integrity, safety, and minimize system downtime.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a proposed maintenance schedule for regular system maintenance to include downtime for maintenance/updates with the least impact to the operations of the systems. The Government anticipates peak hours for all systems to be weekdays from 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST).</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure all systems are fully functional 24 hours per day, 7 days per week (except scheduled maintenance). Immediate notification to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) is required upon realization of any system failure for any reason to include natural or man-made disasters. In the event of a major natural (e.g., weather, etc.) or man-made (e.g., power outages, etc.) disaster causing shutdown of CIRB operations, the Contractor provide a plan and ensure that the system shall be operational within 4 hours and be fully operational within 24 hours.</p>
<p>&bull; Work diligently to restore any such failure in the most expedient manner, while providing status updates to the COR until the system failure is resolved.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a detailed back-up plan for system failure to include plans for testing the disaster recovery plan at least twice per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a secondary facility, geographically separated from the primary facility, to ensure continuity of NCI CIRB operations.</p>
<p><br />II. Delivery: The Contractor that receives the award will be provided with the complete mailing address and point of contact.</p>
<p>III. Payment: Payment shall be made after delivery and acceptance of the product. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoice to the NCI COR and NIH Commercial Accounts.</p>

<DESC><p>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking commercialization partners for its Hyperion cyber security technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyperion is a technology designed to "look inside" an executable program and determine software's function or "behavior" without the use of the software's source code.&nbsp; Hyperion accomplishes this by generating associated program behaviors and the complete set of conditions under which they occur. These behaviors can be automatically checked for known malicious signatures and inspected by domain experts to assure correct operation and the absence of malicious content.&nbsp; Hyperion can also be used to check a program's security properties and to optimize a program.&nbsp; (Development of the Hyperion technology was made possible, in part, by funding from the Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems program within the Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.)</p>
<p>More information can be found at this ORNL Technology Transfer <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/partnerships/ornl%E2%80%99s-hyperion-technology">website</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States-based businesses and small businesses.</p>
<p>For additional information and license application, contact David Sims, Commercialization Manager, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, <a href="mailto:simsdl@ornl.gov">simsdl@ornl.gov</a> , 865-241-3808.</p>

<SUBJECT>Research Report on Chinese Investment in U.S. Aviation
<SOLNBR>USCC-033
<RESPDATE>012916
<CONTACT>Katherine Koleski, Research Director, Phone 202-624-1482, Fax 202-624-1406, Email kkoleski@uscc.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS:<br />January 11, 2016<br /><br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />January 29, 2016 <br />
<p><br />ABOUT PROPOSALS. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on Chinese investment in the U.S. aviation sector.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in P.L. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states, "The Commission...shall investigate and report ... on..."</p>
<p>"(B) The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of manufacturing, advanced technology and intellectual property, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on the national security of the United States (including the dependence of the national security industrial base of the United States on imports from China), the economic security of the United States, and employment in the United States, and the adequacy of United States export control laws in relation to the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(D) Foreign investment ...by the People's Republic of China in the United States, including an assessment of its economic and security implications, [and] the challenges to market access confronting potential United States investment in the People's Republic of China..."</p>
<p>"(E) The military plans, strategy and doctrine of the People's Republic of China ... the interaction between the civilian and military leadership in the People's Republic of China ... force modernization objectives and trends for the People's Republic of China military, and the implications of such objectives and trends for the national security of the United States."</p>
<p>"(I) The compliance of the People's Republic of China with its commitments to the World Trade Organization, other multilateral commitments, bilateral agreements signed with the United States, commitments made to bilateral science and technology programs, and any other commitments and agreements strategic to the United States (including agreements on intellectual property rights and prison labor imports), and United States enforcement policies with respect to such agreements."</p>
<p>The report's key research requirements are:</p>
<p>1. What are the projections from Chinese and international sources on the demand for aviation products in China in the short-, medium-, and long-term? What is the current breakdown of suppliers to the Chinese market for aviation products (built up units such as wide body, single aisle, regional, turboprop, helicopters and other platforms as well as component products)?</p>
<p>2. Assess the current state of China's domestic commercial and general aviation sector across every stage of research, design, and production. What are the Chinese government's policies for promoting the domestic development and production of commercial and general aircraft? Can these policies be carried out relying only on Chinese domestic technologies? What is the role of foreign firms in the development of China's aviation manufacturing industry? What are the policies of the Chinese government toward foreign companies? What are the means by which the Chinese government encourages aviation technology transfers, and what are the implications for jobs and manufacturing capacity in the U.S. aerospace industry? What are the implications of Chinese domestic aviation sector development for U.S. global competitiveness?</p>
<p>3. Assess Chinese investment in the U.S. aviation sector, including through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), joint ventures (JVs), and other cooperative activities. Which sectors or industries have been the target of Chinese investment (e.g., research and design, engines, avionics, materials, etc.)? How are these investments contributing to the development of China's domestic aviation industry? What has been the impact on technology transfers? Is there evidence that Chinese companies have been using M&amp;As or JVs as a mechanism for evading U.S. export controls? Have acquisitions of U.S. commercial and general aviation technology (including through M&amp;As and JVs) contributed either directly or indirectly to China's military capabilities and, if so, how? What relationships have Chinese firms, research institutes, or universities developed with U.S. universities in the aviation area, if any?</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($43.98 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall agree to participate in up for four (4) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, DC area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>
<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key research requirements").</p>
<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1. A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>
<p>2. Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report. It is understood that the designation of the researchers is a critical element of the proposal, and any changes regarding which individuals will be involved in the report's preparation must be approved by the Commission in advance and in writing.</p>
<p>3. A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ. In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used.</p>
<p>4. A list of any entities for whom you have conducted research or provided consulting services in the past. The Commission understands you may be limited in providing such information by confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p>5. An estimate of the time the applicant will need to complete the required work.</p>
<p>6. The price the applicant will charge to the Commission to complete the work set forth in this RFP.</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals wishing to submit a proposal in response to this RFP must ensure that the response arrives at the location noted below by 5:30PM (EST) on January 29, 2016, or it will not be accepted or considered.</p>

<p><br />SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP) Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE. THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER. WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE. THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:</p>
<p>PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER PROJECT/TASK NUMBER <br />ESTIMATED AMOUNT</p>
<p>2116446PCZ031 $15,000.00</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED, AND THE INTENDED USE:</p>
<p>This purchase provides high end controller hardware and support software needed to complete the final PXIe test computer. Each of the PXIe's are legally required to have its own support software and licensed program.</p>
<p>This third and final purchase will complete the upgrade of the collection of aging automated test units used by C3CEN ERF Automated Test Equipment (ATE) Section.</p>
<p>UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:</p>
<p>The Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) has invested over $100,000.00 dollars in National Instruments PXI ATE consoles. The products requested for in this PR are peripheral devices for a PXI ATE console made by National Instruments (OEM). National Instruments retains proprietary and copy rights and is the sole source authority.</p>
<p>The ERF's existing National Instruments PXI test equipment platforms are identical to each other, which means that the code written on one PXI may be successfully deployed to all our PXI testers with a high confidence of identical outcomes in all our circuit card tests. This same concept has to apply to any new PXI device we purchase-it needs to match the existing PXI systems we obtained in 2010 and 2012. Strange incompatibility failures could be introduced if we choose to use non- N.I. components and we could waste a lot of time and money troubleshooting the test device instead of troubleshooting circuit cards for the fleet. In an electronics troubleshooting, fault analysis environment, uncertainty introduced by the test equipment must be eliminated and replaced by the confidence instilled by a compatible configuration of like components- for example, any component "A" of PXI-1 could be immediately swapped for component "A" of PXI-2 with no difference in performance. Only by utilizing hardware and software from National Instruments are we guaranteed to have no configuration conflicts-allowing us to concentrate on our core mission of circuit card repair.</p>
<p>The C3CEN ERF ATE Section has had highly successful results utilizing the PXI systems; National Instruments provides outstanding after- purchase support through their web site, discussion forums, regular software updates, engineer help lines and on-site tech assist visits. We believe the ERF will be successful in the future because we buy test equipment that meets our needs today and will surpass our expectations tomorrow. The U.S. Coast Guard made a wise choice to invest in National Instruments, and we wish to continue ensuring future success by using the products which have proven to be successful.</p>
<p>REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:</p>
<p>Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using part numbers and item names for a list of manufacturers/vendors that could provide automated test equipment and no other brand/substitute could meet the OEM specification.</p>
<p>EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE:</p>
<p>The products requested for in this PR are peripheral devices for a PXI ATE console made by National Instruments (OEM). National Instruments retains proprietary and copy rights and is the sole source authority. Adequate item information, documentation, and specifications are not available to develop an appropriate purchase description for full and open competition. The estimated cost of researching a new automated test equipment platform and replacing the current ERF ATE platform, is unreasonable and cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Recommend no actions be taken at this time to overcome barriers barring full and open competition.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>1.1 USCG District Eight is seeking membership with a fitness center located in New Orleans, LA.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>2.1 The objective of this effort is to acquire a minimum of thirty corporate memberships with a fitness center that will enable USCG District Eight personnel to meet established physical fitness requirements. Military and civilian personnel assigned to USCG District Eight do not currently have access to such a physical fitness facility.</p>
<p>2.2 USCG District Eight has a staff of nearly 200 active duty and civilian personnel. The contractor shall provide a membership arrangement that allows for the membership of up to 30 USCG District Eight personnel to utilize cardiovascular and strength training equipment at any given time during the contractor's hours of operation. These passes will allow one person, per day for each pass.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>3.1 The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, tools, management, and supervision necessary to provide a safe and secure fitness center.</p>
<p>3.2 USCG District Eight personnel, using a general issue membership purchased by the USCG, shall have unlimited access to all standard commercial services available to other private and corporate members of the fitness center.</p>
<p>3.3 In order to accommodate dynamic work hours, operational priorities, and scheduled work commitments, the fitness center shall be open Monday - Friday. USCG District Eight personnel shall have unlimited access during normal fitness center hours. Hours of operation at a minimum shall be:</p>
<p>Monday - Friday: 0530 - 2100 <br />Saturday and Sunday: Preferred but not required</p>

Contractor shall specify the number of showers available for use at the facility.</p>
<p>3.7 The fitness center shall be located within a 0.5-mile distance from 500 Poydras Street, New Orleans, LA 70113. This distance allows personnel to arrive at the fitness center, properly warm up, exercise, shower, and return the workplace in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>3.8 To provide for personnel safety, maximize CG use of the fitness center, and minimize costs incurred by individual CG District Eight personnel striving to meet established CG fitness and weight requirements, it is necessary that the fitness center offer a parking option to CG District Eight personnel while exercising within the fitness center. The contractor shall identify parking for patrons at no additional or incorporated cost to the government contract. Parking charges are not the responsibility of the government.</p>
<p>3.9 It is preferred that the fitness center offer fitness classes and contain space that is sufficient to facilitate team competitions, intramurals, and 15-20 person group workouts.</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

REQUESTING SERVICE:  	Clinical Engineering

INTRODUCTION:	

The purpose of this service contract is to ensure that medical equipment booms throughout VA Boston are receiving preventative maintenance in a timely and effective manner per the manufacturer's recommendations. Medical equipment booms are highly specialized pieces of equipment which require specific training and equipment to service, which clinical engineering currently does not have. Since the equipment has a high complexity but low frequency for service, this skillset is hard to maintain in-house.  This scope of work will outline the requirements and expectations for potential vendors that can provide the aforementioned preventative maintenance services.


BACKGROUND:	

The VA Boston Healthcare system currently has medical equipment booms in the OR and endoscopy procedure rooms at both the West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain medical centers.  Medical equipment booms are ceiling mounting structures which hold medical equipment in a consolidated carrier and also clinicians to position the equipment around the operating suite in a more efficient manner. Equipment booms also have medical gas lines and power outlets built in so that the clinician has everything they need to provide patient care anywhere in the room. Although these booms are extremely helpful and provide procedure room organization, they are highly specialized pieces of equipment which require specific training and equipment to service, which clinical engineering currently does not have. Since the equipment has a high complexity but low frequency for service, this skillset is hard to maintain in-house.

SCOPE OF WORK & REQUIREMENTS:
	
The service contract to help maintain these booms should contain the following components at a minimum:

a.)	The contractor must have service personnel with experience and expertise on the boom make/models identified below.

b.)	The contractor must perform preventative maintenance (PM) on the booms annually to meet the manufacturer's recommended service frequency.


c.)	The preventative maintenance should cover the following areas per the manufacturer's recommendations:
"	Tightening of all fasteners/hardware
"	Checking mounting structure above the ceiling, and adjusting as necessary to ensure proper function
"	Clean entire boom system
"	Check for medical gas leaks
"	Check all friction adjustments & adjust as necessary
"	Level all shelves
"	Check articulation stops
"	Clean old grease and bioburden within joints
"	Grease friction points as necessary
"	Check-up limit stops on all hydraulic (EL) arms
"	Check down limit stops on dock it systems
"	Check cables and hoses for wear and for proper articulation
"	Check pump oil level on hydraulic (EL) arms
"	Check and adjust upper and lower hydraulic arm limit switches
"	Check incoming voltage to pump
"	Check outlet electrical connections
"	Check communication cable connections
"	Check function of gas outlet latch valves
"	Check for proper fuses in pump assembly
"	Test circuit breaker function in pump assembly
"	Check plumb adjustment of flat screen arm if applicable
"	Level of monitors
"	Check all warning labels and decals
"	Check all wiring to ensure proper connections are made at the point of termination

d.)	Contractor must provide pricing information on emergency repairs, including labor and travel time, along with the equipment PM proposals.
  
e.)	Any issues found related to electrical, medical gases, vacuum, or other utilities need to be reported to clinical engineering. These items must be addressed internally through the VA engineering/facilities department.

f.)	The contractor must provide a report of service summary for any work performed to the clinical engineering point of contact.

g.)	Clinical engineering requires a maximum 4 hour call back response time for any non-PM service related issues that are communicated to the contractor. Likewise clinical engineer requires a maximum 24 hour timeframe in which the contractor must be on-site to address any service calls.

h.)	If a boom is removed from service, the VA should be refunded credit valued based on the amount of time left that was previously paid for that contract year.

i.)	One session of first responder training for booms at both the West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain VA Medical Centers.

j.)	No parts should be ordered without prior confirmation from the clinical engineering service.

k.)	Clinical engineering will require at least an annual meeting to review contract performance, equipment changes, and provide support feedback.

SUMMARY OF DELIVERABLES:

STATEMENT OF WORK 	

 STATEMENT of WORK and Functional Performance 
Title: Live Imaging of brain cells in behaving rodents 
1. System Description 

A severe limitation in current preclinical experimental paradigms is that it is not possible to peer deep within the brain to image activity of neurons. Therefore, by not capturing live images of cellular activity only a limited view of brain function is being obtained. A device is required that peers into the brains of rodents and allows researchers to record images of many neurons as the rodent is performing complex behavioral tasks, without impeding the behavior of the animal. 
A highly specialized device weighing approximately 2 grams, that sits atop the brains of small rodents such as mice, and which captures video images of neurons deep within the brain in freely-behaving rodents. The device will capture in real-time cellular activity data from hundreds of neurons in awake, freely-behaving animals in any brain region. This miniature microscope device will attach to a rodent's skull allowing researchers to record brain cell activity without impeding the behavior of the animal. Vendor should provide excellent training support and workshops to assist scientists in planning and designing research protocols. 
The vendor must be able to supply instrumentation to meet the following specifications: 
a. The device must enable live imaging of rodent neurons 
b. The device must allow the user to adjust focus to obtain sharp images. 
c. Hardware must be able to decode the signal and graphically present it. 
d. Software must be able to analyze the data. 
e. The integrated equipment must be user-friendly. 
f. Windows compatible computer (Win7) will integrate the data. 
g. Mass of device: 2g 
h. Dimensions: 11mm x 14mm x 20mm 
i. Modality: epifluorescence 
j. Excitation: 475/10nm (Blue) 
k. Collection: 535/50nm (green) 
l. Field of view: 1440 pixels x 1080 pixels; 900um x 650 um 
m. Temporal resolution: 30 fps at full field of view with USB3.0

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to change the response time from January 25, 2016 to January 22, 2016.&nbsp;<br /><br />Combined Synopsis / Solicitation
<p>Title: Bioanalytical Testing Services</p>
<p>(i) This is a combined synopsis-solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2016-21 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85-1/01-04-2016.</p>
<p>(iv) A notice regarding any set-aside restrictions, the associated NAICS code 325199- Chemical Manufacturing - All other basic organic chemical Manufacturing<br />Business Sized Standard: $24.0</p>
<p>(v) Bioanalytical Testing Services of chemical molecules PIP4K2 and KDM5B</p>
<p>(vi) Background <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br /><br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 alpha (PIP4K2) catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) on the fourth hydroxyl of the myo-inositol ring, to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). It may exert its function by regulating the levels of PtdIns5P, which functions in the cytosol by increasing AKT activity and in the nucleus signals through ING2 and ay regulate the pool of cytosolic PtdIns5P in response to the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, PIP4K2 may also negatively regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by lowering the levels of PtdIns5P and may be involved in thrombopoiesis, and the terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and regulation of their size.</p>
<p>Lysine-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is a histone demethylase that demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code. KDM5B does not demethylate histone H3 'Lys-9' or H3 'Lys-27'. It demethylates trimethylated, dimethylated and monomethylated H3 'Lys-4' and acts as a transcriptional corepressor for FOXG1B and PAX9. It favors the proliferation of breast cancer cells by repressing tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1 and HOXA5. In contrast, KDM5B may act as a tumor suppressor for melanoma and represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional activation of the core clock component PER2.<br />Both these proteins are of great interest to study for NCGC and hence, we seek to profile 5 proprietary compounds against these proteins (each) using surface plasmon resonance. We have previously worked with this vendor who developed a custom, proprietary method for running the SPR against another target, IDH1. The results were used as part of the CBC project and we now expect to continue using these precise services to allow for continuity of data.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain bioanalytical testing services to characterize PIP4K2 and KDM5B and then assess 5 compounds for each protein.</p>
<p>Scope of Work<br />Independently and not as an agent of the Federal Government, the contractor shall characterized ATP, ADP, and 1 control compound against three forms of PIP4K2 and characterizes full-length and truncated form of KDM5B. Upon completion of these services, the contractor shall profile 5 small molecules for PIP4K2 and KDM5 each using a proprietary method used previously against IDH1. The contract shall also provide binding constant to NCGC within 4 weeks of start of experiment. The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center NCGC is responsible for providing vendor with proteins and compounds.</p>
<p>(vii) Vendor shall provide a complete report and binding constants. NCGC will ship reagents after the award is made, vendor shall provide binding constant for each small molecule with 4 weeks after experiment has been started.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Selection of an Offeror for award will be on the basis of lowest price technically acceptable quote meeting the government's essential features as described herein.</p>
<p>Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.</p>
<p><br />(x) The provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xi) FAR clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. An addendum to FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) FAR clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xiii) There are no additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions (such as contract financing arrangements or warranty requirements) determined by the contracting officer to be necessary for this acquisition and consistent with customary commercial practices.</p>
<p>(xiv) The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement.</p>
<p>(xv) Responses to this solicitation must include sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities of providing the product or service. In addition, responses must include clear and convincing evidence of the offeror's capability of fulfilling the requirement as it relates to the salient characteristics.</p>
<p>The response should be practical, clear, and concise; should use quantitative terms whenever possible; should avoid qualitative adjectives; and should comprehensively address the requirements of this solicitation.</p>

<p>8. DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT:</p>
<p>Condition Found Report, Change Orders will be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how these documents are to be followed for the duration of the contract performance period:</p>
<p>(a) Condition Found Report (CFR) - All readings and inspections are to be taken within 24 hours after the machinery or system is opened. All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Change Request- CR and IGE are generated by the COR and entered in the Contract Workbook. COR will assign the Change request number.<br />4. COR provides copy of Change Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on CR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Change Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO</p>
<p>Change Request must be submitted by the COR to the contractor within 24 hours after responding to the CFR. Contractor must submit proposal to the Contracting Officer within 72 hours receipt of the Change Request.</p>
<p>A modification will be issued to incorporate and implement all changes made by change orders.</p>
<p><br />9. CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR. The COR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COR in writing.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Global Health (CGH), Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM), intends to negotiate a sole source contract with EMMES, 401 N. Washington St., Suite 700, Rockville, MD 20850, to provide clinical trial data management services that meet the regulatory and reporting requirements for the following vaccine clinical trial:</p>
<p>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine Administered by Direct Venous Inoculation (DVI) to Healthy Children and Infants 5 Months through 12 Years of Age Living in an Area of High Malaria Transmission in Western Kenya: Age De-escalation and Dose Escalation and a Double Blind, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial for Safety and Efficacy.</p>
<p>Emmes has experience with PfSPZ malaria vaccine trials and data management in Africa. The efficacy of a malaria vaccine may be related to transmission levels, prior malaria exposure and acquired immunity, and other factors particular to where the vaccine is tested. It is essential that CDC objectively and accurately assesses the performance of the PfSPZ vaccine and compare the performance across multiple malaria transmission levels, populations, countries and age groups. Such comparisons are frequently very complex because of different methods in collecting data, different measures of efficacy, and the use of different analyses. The design of data collection tools, data management and monitoring, and analysis for the majority of the PfSPZ studies done or planned were or will be managed by Emmes. To ensure coordination and comparability, we are requesting sole source contracting of Emmes, so they can provide similar data management services for the trial we are planning, so that a seamless comparison of data can occur between sites.</p>
<p>Due to the collaborative nature of this initiative, it is expected that utilization of existing systems, processes, and technical expertise will be the most efficient approach to achieving project objectives. Establishment of data management continuity of support will greatly reduce delays in addressing this urgent global research need. The use of developed processes and existing systems will ensure the results generated from the proposed clinical trial in Kenya can be rapidly and efficiently analyzed upon study completion, and would expedite quick and efficient harmonization, merging, and integration of data from this study with previous/subsequent studies in order to generate the appropriate information needed to inform immunological assessment, safety, and clinical efficacy.</p>
<p>The use of other than full and open competition for this acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a Capability Statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. All responses will be considered. All Capability Statements shall be received by the closing date of this synopsis and shall be submitted in writing. Responses may be sent via email to luw9@cdc.gov. No solicitation will be issued. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>

REQUIREMENT:

The FAA has a current requirement for the acquisition, installation, maintenance and training support of X-Ray Package Screening Systems at approximately 50 locations throughout the continental United States.  Vendors are requested to demonstrate experience and capabilities of providing maintenance and training for X-Ray Package Screening Systems.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Revised X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work, attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified below and in the attached X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

The FAA anticipates that any resultant contract will be Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity with Firm Fixed Price CLINs and one Corrective Maintenance Labor Hour CLIN.  Any such contract is further anticipated to be have a base period of performance of one (1) year and four (1) year option periods.

At this time the nature of any competition that may result from this market survey has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of an anticipated procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334517 with a size standard of 500 employees.

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages, excluding the Business Declaration form and SBA certification documentation. No type font less than 11 point may be used.

PURPOSE:	
This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:

The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.

In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

a. Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the Revised X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work)

b. Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)

c. Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

<CONTACT>Chad Slade, Phone 619-532-3372, Fax 619-532-4789, Email chad.a.slade@navy.mil
<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised as a set aside for Small Business (FAR 52.219-6) concerns. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered. This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair within the NAICS code listed, primarily by design-build or secondarily by design-bid-build, of commercial and institutional buildings at various government installations located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, armory, auditoriums, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQs), child care centers, fire stations, gymnasiums, hangars, hospitals, maintenance/repair facilities, warehouses, and other similar facilities. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000. Task orders will range between $8,000,000 and $15,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two: Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted. THE SOLICITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about December 21, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website address listed above. A sources sought notice was posted on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms. As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement as a small business set-aside. The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) San Diego District Office and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

<DESC>AMENDMENT #2:&nbsp; THE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF SUBMISSIONS HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 20 JANUARY 2016.<br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS NUMBER HAS BEEN CHANGED TO:&nbsp; W911WN-16-SS-0001.<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought announcement only. This is not a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. Response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will not affect any vendor's ability to submit a proposal if and when a solicitation is issued. The purpose of this synopsis is to survey the market and gain knowledge of potential interested contractors for completing the work effort relative to NAICS 237310-HIGHWAY, STREET AND BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION.
<p>Estimated magnitude of construction: $250K - $500K</p>
<p>The Whiteday Creek Public Access Bridge is located at the entrance to Opekiska Lock and Dam near Everettville, WV, 7 miles southwest of Morgantown, WV. The bridge carries Opekiska Road (Route 36) across the mouth of Whiteday Creek where it empties into the Monongahela River to provide the only public land access to the locks.</p>
<p>The bridge consists of three simple spans and measures 200'-0" in length overall between the abutment bearings. The two end spans each span 50'-0" between the abutment bearing and pier centerlines, while the middle span spans 100'-0" between the pier centerlines. Transversely, the deck measures 25'-0" out-to-out and 21'-0" from curb-to-curb. Guardrails are installed above both curbs. The main load-carrying members are eight adjacent precast pre-stressed concrete box beams. At the Main Span, each single-cell beam measures 4'-0" in height at the ends over the piers and 3'-9" in height at mid-span. The Main Span box beams are post-tensioned with two 1&frac14;" tie rods through solid concrete diaphragms at three separate and equally spaced locations along the span. Grouted shear keys are located longitudinally between the beams near the top. An asphalt wearing surface overlays the tops of the box beams. At the Main Span, the overlay thickness measures 3&frac12;" at the roadway centerline and is gradually sloped to both curbs for drainage. The substructure includes two single-shaft reinforced concrete piers situated on sound rock. Additionally, the reinforced concrete abutments are founded on steel piles driven to sound rock.</p>
<p>There is evidence that water is penetrating the box beams and that the shear keys between adjacent beams are deteriorated. The exposed pre-stressing strands are cause for concern as the pretension force in the strands and structural capacity of the affected box beams are assumed to be compromised. The bridge currently has a 5 ton weight limit to reduce the impact on the bridge.</p>
<p>The Contractor will install carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips to the underside of the Main Span box beams to strengthen the beams. The CFRP strips will be installed after making concrete repairs to spalled areas with exposed pre-stressing strands. Approximately 90 linear feet of 4-foot wide beam flange will need to be repaired and reinforced with CFRP strips. Repairs will consist of removing unsound concrete, cleaning exposed reinforcing and pre-stressing strands, applying a corrosion inhibitor and bonding agent, and repairing the area with low-permeability concrete patch material. The bottom of the beams are approximately 4'-3" (at their lowest) to 5'-6" (at their highest) above normal pool elevation. Actual clear distance will vary based on releases from Opekiska Lock and Dam and the time of year.</p>
<p>The project completion date is set at 150 days following contract award. The Notice to Proceed (NTP) will be granted by the Contracting Officer following contract award after the Contractor provides Performance and Payment bonds.</p>
<p>Official Solicitation will likely be issued March of 2016. Results of this sources sought will be used, in part, to determine the feasibility of a small business or lower tier socio-economic set aside for this project and to determine if the Rule of 2 has been met for any particular category of small business. All qualified contractors are encouraged to respond; lack of responses may jeopardize the project being set aside for small business.</p>
<p>Offeror's response to synopsis shall be limited to 8 pages and shall include the following information:</p>
<p>-Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address, and web site (if any);</p>
<p>-Offeror's business designation and socioeconomic sector (eg. Large, Small, 8(a), Woman-owned, Service-disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, etc.);</p>
<p>-Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and DUNS Number; if a member of a joint-venture or mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement with the SBA, please provide information on both members of the JV.</p>
<p>-Contractor's Bonding Capacity</p>
<p>-Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation once it is issued;</p>
<p>-Offeror's capability to meet the requirements including specific equipment and experience with the means and methods described in this sources sought announcement; if a member of a joint venture, the offeror should include relevant information from both members of the JV. Do not provide information on other repair methods as this project has already been developed and other methods have been considered and discarded as not feasible either in terms of cost or other factors.</p>
<p>-Offeror's ability to perform at least 15% of the effort with its own equipment;</p>
<p>-Offeror's capability to perform a contract of this complexity, comparable work performed within the past 5 years, including a brief description of the project, customer name, timelines of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of project. If a member of a joint venture, the offeror should include relevant information from both members of the JV.</p>
<p>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 3:00PM (EST) on 16 December, 2015. E-mail is perferred method of replying to this synopsis. Please respond to the point of contact listed in this sources sought announcement.</p>
