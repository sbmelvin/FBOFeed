<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial products and services. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519 including Exception 2 for value added resellers. The small business size standard is 150 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>This is a brand name only requirement. Quoters must provide the brand name software identified within the line items.</p>
<p>This is a brand name only requirement for Oracle software and support. This project supports Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) biometrics research and development objectives in automated fingerprint-matching system testing, and standards through an on-going FBI/National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) collaboration.</p>
<p>NIST has been in collaboration with the FBI since 1968 in conducting research on automated fingerprint-matching systems. Since 2008, with the help and support from the FBI, the current legacy fingerprint-matching test environment at NIST is in a transitional phase to update NIST's current supercomputer based architecture to the new blade-based Next Generation Identification (NGI) system currently in operation at the FBI. The blade-based NGI system architecture utilizes a fingerprint-matching system designed specifically for the FBI's current operational system. The FBI requires that NIST install the NGI system architecture, on FBI supplied hardware so that NIST will remain in sync with the FBI's operational system.</p>
<p>Transition and updating of the NIST fingerprint-matching system to duplicate the fingerprint-matching subsystem of the FBI's new NGI system is critical for NIST to remain in sync with the operational behavior of the FBI system, to ensure repeatability of NIST's testing framework, and maintain the collaboration.</p>
<p>The database management system software by Oracle is the database management system used in the FBI system and the subsystem NIST must duplicate. The Oracle database management system is the only system that is identical to the FBI's subsystem and will ensure performance replication of the FBI's finger print matching subsystem.</p>
<p>NIST requires the Oracle brand database management system software lobe installed on the FBI supplied hardware already in NIST's possession and intended for this purpose.</p>

NMCI provides end-to-end secure Information Technology (IT) services to more than 400,000 seats and 800,000 users, across 2,500+ USN and USMC locations that vary from major bases to single user locations.   NMCI has been operated under the programmatic and operational oversight of the DON until the end of the contract period of performance, September 30, 2010.  On October 1, 2010, the DON transitioned to the NMCI Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC), for the continued delivery of NMCI services to the DON, through April 30, 2014 (if all options are exercised).  The DON intends to transition IT services from CoSC to the follow-on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract(s). The primary goals of NGEN are to: 1) operate the NMCI network while maintaining delivery of NMCI network and computing services; 2) support the NMCI network and associated computing services from requirement identification to service disposal; 3) ensure continued security of the network and proactive enhancement of information assurance (IA) capabilities to meet evolving and emerging threats; 4) provide Government Command and Control (C2) to ensure flexible and responsive operation and defense of the network; 5) leverage DoD enterprise security services provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to meet user requirements as technically and fiscally feasible and approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA); and 6) maintain continuity of service during transition from NMCI CoSC to follow-on NGEN contract(s) or Government operation. The Government anticipates firm fixed price, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for the Transport and Enterprise Services requirements.  Award will be made to the offeror or combination of offerors that results in the lowest total combined price to the Government for the transition to, and operation and maintenance of the Next Generation Enterprise Network. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with four one-year options.  This is a full and open competition. With the exception of attachments J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J-43, this RFP has been released with all supporting attachments.  Hardcopies of documents will not be provided. Do to the proprietary nature of J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J- 43 these attachments have been posted to the NGEN MITRE Technical Data site located at: https://partners.mitre.org/sites/NEN_TXS_RFP_GOV_TECH_DOC/NGEN_Technical_ DATA/default.aspx MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), is providing a secure server to host the NGEN applicable documents and technical data.
