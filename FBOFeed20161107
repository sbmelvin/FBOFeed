However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

Destination: SW3211; 19. Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  The Competition Advocate (CA) at each contracting activity/office (as defined in DLAD 2.101) shall act as the ombudsman and attempt to resolve contractor complaints.  DLA AVIATION - AOB's CA/ombudsman can be reached at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

<DESC>A Market Survey was conducted by Sources Sought Announcement on 17 March 2016 posted on NECO/FedbizOpps seeking availability and capability of qualified and eligible businesses in the Small Business Programs.  As a result of the market research analysis, the Government did not find a minimum of two verified, capable, small business contractors in any socio-economic program available to perform the design and construction services for this project. On 08 August 2016, the Small Business Program Office concurred with the following unrestricted, full and open competition determination.

THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 6.1 FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
 This procurement will use the one-step lowest priced technically acceptable selection procedures and consists of one (1) solicitation. Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price design-bid-build construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government. 

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction of utilities and road infrastructure of P-991, Coastal Campus Utilities Infrastructure, Silverstrand Training Complex-South, Naval Base Coronado, Coronado, California. 

The scope of work for project P-991 is to construct utilities infrastructure and roads to support the build-out of the Silver Strand Training Complex-South (SSTC-S), in support of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).
 The SSTC-S currently does not have the utilities and infrastructure required to support the planned major installation expansion. The scope of work for project P-991 will build primary facilities for electrical, gas, water, sanitary sewer, storm water, fire protection, communication and data systems. Utility stub-outs and connections will be built for future projects to adequately connect to the utility infrastructure. Adequate utilities infrastructure is required to support MILCON projects programmed for construction at SSTC-S. This requirement necessitates a capital investment to ensure all MILCON projects will be able to tie into adequate utilities systems required to use the facilities. The project will allow the facilities developed by the future MILCON projects to be operationally ready and usable upon construction completion.
 The Base Proposal Item includes all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, supervision, and incidental related work to provide construction, procurement, and installation to construct the infrastructure.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The estimated price range for design and construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Factor 1  Experience, Factor 2  Safety, Factor 3  Past Performance.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.
 The RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil by 23 November 2016. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION. 

Prospective Offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. 

A pre-proposal conference including site visit will be conducted.

<DESC>This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement N00383-14-G-006D with Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, Indianapolis, IN (Cage Code 072E5). This synopsis serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by NAVSUP WSS in the time period from December 20, 2014 to December 19, 2015 against the subject BOA.

Individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under the Navy Weapon System covered by this BOA. A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact. 

Pursuant to this synopsis, orders issued against the subject BOA will be issued in accordance with 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award as the items are flight critical and/or the available technical data has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production/repair of the same or similar item.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Received offers that failed to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under any order issued against the subject BOA.

<DESC>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sources Sought Synopsis:</span> This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted and responses will not be used as proposals.<br />&nbsp;
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to this SSS.</p>
<p>b) The results of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this market research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.</p>
<p>c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice to foreign-owned firms</span>: Such firms should be aware that restrictions apply which exclude foreign participation at the prime contractor level.</p>
<p>d) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background/Requirements</span>:</p>
<p>a) The current sole-source C-17 Aircraft Globemaster Operational Enhancements (GLOBE) contract is currently being performed by The Boeing Company (Contract FA8614-13-D-2002). It is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with an ordering period of five (5) years (Dec 2012 through Dec 2017). This effort provides for the development of integrated software and hardware upgrades to the Boeing-developed C-17 aircraft and provides infrastructure support necessary to support development efforts. Boeing has been the sole designer, manufacturer, and integrator of the C-17 air vehicle since program inception. No data package is available for other contractors.</p>
<p>b) Unless there are viable respondents to this SSS that can meet the requirements specified herein, the Government, in accordance with DFARS 217.204(e)(i), plans to extend the ordering period for Contract FA8614-13-D-2002 an additional five (5) years (Dec 2012 through Dec 2022), and the period of performance accordingly (through Dec 2027). Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research. Please provide information regarding capabilities (e.g. - a brochure or description of capabilities and nature of the goods and/or services the company provides). Respondents are asked to self-identify or express interest to valerie.wetzel@us.af.mil no later than 7 Dec 2016. The Boeing point of contact for subcontracting possibilities is Sonia Saxena-Patel, 2401 E. Wardlow Road, Long Beach, CA 90807-5309; telephone number is 714-896-1091.</p>
<p>3. In response to this SSS, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Information</span>: Please provide the following business information for your company and for any teaming or joint venture partners:</p>
<p>- Company Name:<br />- Address:<br />- Point of Contact:<br />- CAGE Code:<br />- Phone Number:<br />- E-mail Address:<br />- Web Page URL:</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small Business Set-Aside Determination</span>:</p>
<p>a) In accordance with (IAW) DFARS 210.001, market research results will be used to determine whether the criteria in FAR Part 19 are met for setting aside the acquisition for small business.</p>
<p>b) Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are:</p>
<p>- Other Than Small Business<br />- Small Business <br />- Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) <br />- Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB)<br />- Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB)<br />- 8(a)-Certified Business<br />- Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)<br />- Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB)<br />- Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small business (HUBZone).</p>
<p>c) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 336 - Transportation Equipment Manufacturing / 336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing. This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: (1) manufacturing or assembling complete aircraft; (2) developing and making aircraft prototypes; (3) aircraft conversion (i.e., major modifications to systems); and (4) complete aircraft overhaul and rebuilding (i.e., periodic restoration of aircraft to original design specifications). The size standard associated with this NAICS code is 1,500 employees; please indicate number of employees relative to the indicated size standard.</p>
<p>d) If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply. Please provide rationale as to how compliance with these limitations would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.</p>
<p>e) Please be advised that the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size under the Limitations of Subcontracting, as does the Non-Manufacturer Rule if a supply NAICS is chosen. Respondents should consider how the primary tasks identified in this RFI will be broken out between prime and sub-contractors to avoid ostensible subcontracting, and address in their response if necessary.</p>
<p>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small Business Subcontracting Opportunities</span>: IAW FAR 19.201, it is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, including the opportunity to participate as subcontractors. Please recommend a reasonable expectation for small business subcontracting as a percent of total contract value, as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small Business Breakout Opportunities</span>: If your company is capable of meeting some, but not all of the requirements stated in this RFI, please provide a response detailing the requirements you are capable of meeting. This will allow an assessment of whether or not breaking out a portion of the requirement for Small Business is possible and practicable. Any issues regarding Limitations on Subcontracting (including issues of affiliation and ostensibility) should be considered in your response.</p>
<p>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ombudsman:</span> An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. As stated in 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman:</p>
<p>a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>b) Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>c) If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, the interested party may contact the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Ombudsman:</p>
<p>Lt Col Kenneth Decker, Jr.<br />1790 10th Street Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7630<br />Telephone: 937-255-5512<br />Email: kenneth.decker.1@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>d) Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU/SMC Ombudsman level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC, 20330-1060, Telephone: 571-256-2395, facsimile number 571-256-2431.</p>
<p>e) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>f) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

This media consists of interactive navigation and EC lab exercises and simulated missions using the building block approach and phasing training according to doctrinally correct EC taxonomy, encompassing basic threat recognition to complex real-world aerospace power EC and integrated mission scenarios. The T25 SECT provides introductory navigation and sensor training and full scale mission simulations for typical operations such as strategic/covert penetration, standoff jamming/direct support, electronic intelligence collection and suppression of enemy air defenses with integrated navigation skills training. The T25 SECT system operates on a common computer network, isolated from external networks. The T25 SECT TSSC provides operational support for the trainer and contains a computer system that acts as the network file server for the student stations and also maintains configuration management. The TSSC stores the databases and applications for all of the training events, sorties, and exercises, and associated software and data files, which are downloaded to the student stations for training. The TSSC provides the capability to develop and modify training missions as well as administer, maintain and update the trainer and system software, lab/mission files, library data files, technical publications, engineering drawings and other technical data. A significant T25 SECT technology refresh is currently underway and expected to be completed by October 2016.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to perform a F3I redesign of a CCA within the Receiver Transmitter Assembly (RT) used on the AN/APN-232 Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA) system. The driver of this redesign is due to the ASIC Gate Array, a core component on this circuit card, along with the sample and hold amplifiers, which are obsolete and no alternates are available to support Depot high usage repair/replacement. The Altitude Output Converter (AOC) A2 Circuit Card is one of 11 SRUs interconnecting inside the CARA RT. The principle function is to filter altitude data supplied from other circuit cards, calculate and filter the altitude rate data, and digitally. AN/APN-232 Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA) system is common radar system used by 60% of Air Force aircraft developed by NavCom to provide the altitude measurement of an aircraft flying over a terrain from 0-50,000 feet. </span></p>

Management will include, but not be limited to, responsibility for administrative control of procedural aspects of contract compliance, responsibility for administrative control of Government property, responsibility for production scheduling, responsibility for the composition and delivery of reports as required and responsibility for effective communication of technical and administrative information with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the GEM Production Program Manager, and any other Contracting Officer designated Government personnel. As a minimum, the contractor shall track and report on the number of GEM designs being processed and completed including identification of customers and controlling part numbers emulated, the status of active Delivery Orders and the status of any interruptions of production or quality related deficiencies. The contractor shall also maintain and report the status of the GEM base wafer production and inventory. ( See CDRL A001 and A002)</p>
<p>1.3.1.3 The contractor shall maintain the GEM technology including the minimum level of processes (including process materials such as base wafers and long lead time packages) and the procedures necessary to provide the DoD with required GEM parts. This includes the capability as described in paragraph 1.3.1.1 to design and produce GEM parts.</p>
<p>1.3.1.4 The contractor shall provide the GEM Design Library updates to the DLA Land and Maritime GEM Program Office (as required). The contractor shall also provide training to designated DLA Land and Maritime GEM Program Office for the purpose of reviewing designs, as required. The maximum number of updates required to be delivered shall be twice each year. ( See CDRL A003 )</p>
<p>1.3.1.5 The contractor shall provide for a coordinated Government and contractor marketing effort. The GEM contractor will have primary responsibility for marketing efforts with commercial enterprises and the Government will have primary responsibility for efforts within the military services and with foreign government agencies. Contractor travel related to marketing efforts under Government purview shall be coordinated with and approved by the Government. Costs associated with commercial marketing efforts shall be borne by the contractor except as approved by the Government.</p>
<p>1.3.1.6 The contractor shall provide engineering services such as technical interface with various Government entities such as Weapon System Program Offices, Weapon System Support Activities and other entities whose requirements may be met through GEM technology. The contractor shall also perform engineering services related to the replacement of printed wiring boards or elements thereof employing GEM technology. These engineering services and travel related to these services shall be coordinated with and approved by the Government.</p>
<p>1.3.2 Delivery Order Effort.</p>
<p>1.3.2.1 During the period of performance of this contract (including option periods, if exercised), the Government may issue unilateral delivery orders pursuant to the ordering of provisions of Section I of the contract. These delivery orders will identify the specific part(s) to be delivered, by National Stock Number (NSN), part number, specification or drawing number, as applicable. Delivery orders shall also specify quantities, delivery schedule, shipping points, preservation and packaging requirements, FOB point, and inspection/acceptance point. Government Source Inspection (GSI), First Article Testing, and MIL-PRF-38535 requirements may also be imposed, as appropriate, in individual delivery orders to ensure that the items meet all technical requirements. (CDRLs A004 thru A014 may be invoked on an individual delivery order and if required, the costs will be negotiated under the delivery order) <br /><br />1.3.2.2 GEM engineering services (see 1.3.1.6) such as, but not limited to reviewing obsolescence studies to determine GEM applicability and services related to testing or compatibility of GEM devices may also be ordered under a delivery order. Although this activity is generally performed as part of the Core Effort (see 1.3.1), it may also be ordered separately under a delivery order; primarily to accommodate externally funded requirements.</p>
<p>1.3.2.3 GEM technology extensions such as, but not limited to covering additional microcircuit families by base array development, design modification or process enhancement may also be ordered under a delivery order, when approved by the Government Program Manager. Although this activity is generally performed as part of the Core Effort (see 1.3.1), it may also be ordered separately under a delivery order; primarily to accommodate externally funded requirements.<br /><br />1.3.2.4 GEM design efforts including, but not limited to reverse engineering, performance requirement determination, and circuit design; with or without engineering samples and with or without fully qualified production quantities, when approved by the Government Program Manager. Engineering samples or prototype parts for application testing may also be ordered, when approved by the Government Program Manager. Although this activity is generally performed as part of the Core Effort (see 1.3.1), it may also be ordered separately under a delivery order; primarily to accommodate externally funded requirements.</p>
<p>1.3.2.5 Preservation and packaging of GEM parts shall be in accordance with the purchase order or other contract vehicle such as a delivery order. Military grade packaging in accordance with MIL-STD-129P w/CHANGE 4, MIL-STD-2073 and IPC/JEDEC J-STD-609 may be required. Also when specified, the contractor must affix passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, at the case and palletized unit load levels, when shipping certain items to certain DOD locations. The contractor may be required to submit advance shipment notices to DOD via the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system, to permit association of the passive RFID tag data with the corresponding shipment</p>
<p>1.3.2.6 During any portion of the period of performance of this contract the Government may issue unilateral delivery orders for parts such as, but not limited to parts produced on technology extension processes (see 1.3.2.3). Because of the lack of maturity of these processes and the consequent lack of cost data for elements of part production (e.g., process variability, expected production yield, assembly costs and initial quality assurance testing costs) it will not be reasonable to expect the contractor to be able to project the total part cost without significant risk. As such, pricing and elements of costs to be included in the part price will be negotiated with each delivery order. These delivery orders will identify the specific part(s) to be delivered, by National Stock Number (NSN), part number, specification or drawing number, as applicable. Delivery orders shall also specify quantities, delivery schedule, shipping points, preservation and packaging requirements, FOB point, and inspection/acceptance point. Government Source Inspection (GSI), First Article Testing, and MIL-PRF-38535 requirements may also be imposed, as appropriate, in individual delivery orders to ensure that the items meet all technical requirements.</p>
<p>1.3.2.7 During any portion of the period of performance of this contract the Government may issue unilateral delivery orders for parts from other DLA-developed emulation capabilities (see 1.3.1.1.h). These delivery orders may be, but are not limited, to emulated parts deemed to be in a limited production status. Because of the lack of maturity of these processes and the consequent lack of cost data for elements of part production (e.g., process variability, expected production yield, assembly costs, and initial quality assurance testing costs) it will not be reasonable to expect the contractor to be able to project the total part cost without significant risk. As such, pricing and elements of costs to be included in the part price will be negotiated with each delivery order. Exact specifications of the emulated devices will be described at the time of ordering.</p>
<p>1.3.3 Management. The contractor shall assign a Manager (herewith designated as a key person) to the GEM Production Program. He/she shall be responsible for direct technical communication with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the GEM Production Program Manager, and any other Contracting Officer designated Government personnel. Due to the highly skilled technical nature of the GEM Program's tasking, all technical personnel possessing Bachelor's degrees and above shall be designated as key personnel. Any proposed changes in key personnel shall be submitted in writing (with full resume) to the Contracting Officer for consideration no later than 30 days prior to the proposed date of personnel change. All key personnel changes must be approved by the Contracting Officer in writing prior to the change of personnel. A listing (accompanied by full resumes) of all key personnel performing under the GEM Program shall be provided to the Contracting Officer upon initiation of the contract.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vaisala, Inc. for the repair of thirty-two Ice Free Wind (IFW) Sensors; ASN: S100-2A8MT3A2, for the National Reconditioning Center (NRC) in Grandview, MO.&nbsp;<br /><br />
<p>Justification for Sole Source<br />In support of the National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Offices, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Defense, the National Reconditioning Center requires repair services for the SENSOR, ICE FREE WIND (IFW), ASOS MODEL 425NWS (WS425D7A1C), ASN: S100-2A8MT3A2. The IFW sensors support the mission of life and property protection by providing wind speed and wind direction information for the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) which is used to provide input for weather alerts and warnings at airports. This data is used in weather forecasting, current condition reporting, and climate measurements.  Wind speed and direction information is especially important in determining take-off and landing directions at airports.</p>
<p>Vaisala, Inc. is the depot repair facility for SENSOR, ICE FREE WIND (IFW), ASOS MODEL 425NWS (WS425D7A1C), ASN: S100-2A8MT3A2.  These products were developed at private expense, and include proprietary information and repair data held in escrow.  As such, the calibration and repair of these items can only be performed by Vaisala, Inc.</p>
<p>Vaisala, Inc. is the OEM and is the only company that has the knowledge to perform the necessary repair services for the WS425D7A1C Ice Free Wind Sensors, ASN: S100-2A8MT3A2.  There is only one authorized source of repair for these devices, the original manufacturer - Vaisala.  The Ice Free Wind Sensors were manufactured by Vaisala as a commercially available item and the U.S. Government does not possess the data rights to this item.</p>

The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ELIGIBILITY</span></p>
<p>The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement will be R408. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">561110&nbsp;(Office Administrative Services)</span> with a size standard of $7.5 million. All interested Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to respond with a capabilities statement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROGRAM BACKGROUND</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The anticipated period of performance includes a 5 year ordering period. The anticipated start date is October 2017.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The contract type is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price for labor and Cost Reimbursable for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) including travel and material. This is expected to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with an estimated total Level of Effort of approximately 46,080 hours (with 1 Full Time Equivalent being comprised of 1,920 hours per year) over a period of five years. These services shall be performed on-site at Patuxent River Naval Air Station.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<p>See Attachment 1, Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and Attachment 2, Draft Labor Categories and Hours.</p>
<p>Labor categories anticipated to execute the contemplated services are included in the attached Draft SOW. The anticipated hours per labor category are included in the attachment Draft Labor Category and Hours document.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work themselves in terms of cost of performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business' General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost. The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14, with the exception of Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (FAR 52.219-27(a)(l)) and HUBZone Small Businesses (FAR 52.219-3(d)(1)).

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to extend the current contract (DTFAWA-11-D-00004) with UNICOM Government of Herndon, VA.  This extension will allow for the continued purchase of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware (HW) that includes servers, storage systems, network devices and related services in support of the FAAs information technology (IT) enterprise for a period of four (4) months with two (2) three (3) month option periods.  The purpose of this extension is to allow for a continuation in services so the FAA can complete the current competition for a new contract for this requirement.  The FAA is currently processing a new Strategic Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Personal Computer Device Contract (DTFACT-15-R-00045).

UNICOM is the current provider under contract DTFAWA-11-D-00004. This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the Strategic Acquisition of Various Equipment (SAVES) Program.  This contract provides simple purchasing of COTS HW that includes servers, storage systems, network devices and related services in support of the FAAs information technology (IT) enterprise for the FAAs CONUS and OCONUS locations.
This is a sole source requirement to UNICOM as they are the only current provider of the above products under the FAA mandatory source SAVES contract. The follow-on contracts for this requirement are currently in the pre-award stages. 
The extension to the UNICOM contract will service as a bridge contract consisting of one four (4) month period and two (2) three (3) month periods.  The bridge will serve to avoid any interruption in services while the FAA completes the current competition for a follow-on contract.

Accordingly, a competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement. Any questions or comments about this announcement must be directed to Elizabeth Ford Ochs at Elizabeth.Ford@faa.gov, no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on November 10, 2016.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed the Ground-to-Space Laser Calibration (GSLC) System concept for calibrating earth-observing sensors measuring reflected radiance. GSLC is capable of calibrating sensitivity to polarization, degradation of optics, and response to stray light of spaceborne reflected solar sensors. The concept is based on using an accurate ground-based laser system pointing at and tracking the instrument on orbit during nighttime and clear atmosphere conditions. The GSLC system will be applicable to instrument calibration in both, low earth and geostationary earth orbits. The quality of earth science data products based on observations from spaceborne radiometric sensors depends on their performance and accuracy on orbit. The accuracy of measuring reflected solar radiance can be affected by multiple factors. First, instruments with complex optics are sensitive to polarization. The response of such instruments is characterized before the launch; however, sensitivity to polarization can change on orbit significantly. Other factors are the degradation of optics, particularly in blue wavelength range below 500 nm, and on-orbit changes in the instrument response to stray light. None of the existing sensors has the ability to monitor all these changes in calibration on orbit. Accurate verification of space born sensors calibration on orbit plays a crucial role in meeting mission accuracy requirements. Onboard verification systems significantly impact mission costs by increasing the mass of instrumentation and required power. Also, onboard verification systems are not accessible for adjustment, maintenance, improvement, or repairs in the case of failure. Accordingly, a need exists for an improved calibration concept that does not suffer from the drawbacks of known calibration systems and methods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The present invention comprises an approach for calibrating the sensitivity to polarization, optics degradation, spectral and stray light response functions of instruments on orbit. The calibration is achieved by transmitting an expanded, uniform laser beam to the instrument in low earth or geo-stationary orbit, during nighttime clear sky conditions.&nbsp; The calibration approach uses varying beam polarization and wavelength within short time intervals. The expanded beam with uniform top-hat profile, generated by ground-based laser system, is aimed at and transmitted to the satellite, whereby the entire aperture of the optical sensor on the satellite is exposed to transmitted light. The optical sensor measures the intensity of incident signal on orbit while operations with beam polarization and wavelength are performed using optics on the ground.&nbsp; NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patents 8,767,210 and 9,052,236.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov</a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.&nbsp; Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company.

<p class="MsoNormal">The first invention is a statistical approach to liner design when detailed fan source noise information is not available. This invention uses a statistical representation of the fan source with a duct acoustic propagation and radiation code to determine the optimum impedance spectra for acoustic liners embedded in the walls of the engine nacelle. This optimization may be based on predicted in-duct or far-field acoustic levels. Acoustic liner models are then used to identify geometric liner parameters needed to produce impedance spectra that most closely match these optimum spectra, and therefore provide maximum fan noise reduction. The simulated statistical fan source model accounts for the variation of the fans sound spectrum as the flight conditions change and provides the added benefit of generating confidence intervals for the predicted liner performance. Increased weighting may be applied to specific frequencies and/or operating conditions within the liner design. Thus, the entire broadband frequency spectrum may be targeted simultaneously. This can offer a major advantage over current liner design approaches that focus on narrow-band attenuation spectra (i.e., target individual fan tones) and are generally not broadband in character.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second invention is a graphical tool that allows real-time design and analysis of acoustic liners to achieve optimized broadband acoustic liners. Thus, it takes advantage of recently improved manufacturing techniques to allow implementation of liners in unconventional locations. One example is liners mounted in the body of fan exit guide vanes to reduce engine fan noise. Referred to as ILIAD, the software uses a point-and-click interface to graphically create acoustic chambers within a 2-D representation of the liner design space while predicting the resulting acoustic parameters. Variable-depth chambers are accommodated to maximize the number and length of chambers that can be put in the available space. At the same time, the software computes all of the modeling predictions of the acoustic characteristics to maintain performance levels. Designers will see the acoustic effects of geometry changes instantly. Although the prediction capability is relatively well known, the ability to perform this calculation in an interactive design environment is new. ILIAD enables the exploration of numerous liner design possibilities quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a nanostructure neutron converter layer that can be used for neutron detection. Neutron radiation is a significant risk in long-duration spaceflight and is also a risk in commercial aviation and nuclear reactors. This invention provides for more effective neutron radiation detection than currently available technologies. Ionizing radiation, and in particular neutrons, pose a hazard to crew, passengers, and equipment in aerospace and other industries. For example, one hazard of neutron radiation is neutron activation, i.e., the ability of neutron radiation to induce radioactivity in most substances it encounters, including a person's body tissues. The risk posed by radiation has long been recognized as one of the major challenges to frequent and long duration spaceflight. To help address the risks posed by neutron radiation, effective neutron radiation detectors are needed. This single layer neutron converter can be used to convert neutrons into a readily detectable form of radiation. The neutron converter material has a high neutron absorption cross section, tailored resistivity providing a good electric field penetration with sub-micron particles, and a high secondary electron emission coefficient. The material is formed by either sequential or simultaneous super-critical fluid metallization of a porous nanostructure aerogel or polyimide film. The neutron converter layer can also be formed by in-situ metalized aerogel nanostructure development. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent pending.</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):  http://www.acquisition.gov/far, http://www.doi.gov/pam, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-7967.htm <BR> <BR>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [  ] have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and Cont... <BR> <BR>(D) Have [  ], have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [  ] has not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights? (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. (g) Invoice. (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include? (i) Name and address of the Contractor; (ii) Invoice date and number; (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number; (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered; (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading; (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered; (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent; (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information. (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures. (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT. (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. Cont... <BR> <BR>(h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings. (i) Payment.? (1) Items accepted. Payment shall be made for items accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destinations set forth in this contract. (2) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. (3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (4) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (5) Overpayments.

(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final decisions.

(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt within 30 days; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.

(k) Taxes. The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

(7) The Standard Form 1449. (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments. (9) The specification. (t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor?s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? <BR> <BR>(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to? (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause? (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. (ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are? (A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. (iii) Materials means? (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. (i) Payments. (1) Work performed. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. Cont... <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the? (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall? (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other Direct Costs.

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?).?] Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. Cont... <BR> <BR>(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment? (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor?s timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall? Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the? (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if? (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). Cont... <BR> <BR>(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on? (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ?completion invoice? and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. Cont... <BR> <BR>(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. Cont... <BR> <BR>(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is December 2016. Among vendors who are on QSL MP-1508-03_Manual_Resuscitators, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. </strong>The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Manual Resuscitators.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Manual Resuscitators. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $282,667.60 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MP-1508-03_Manual_Resuscitators who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via email, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement</strong>.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</strong><br /><br />1.	Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br /><strong>Required Products /	Annual Usage in Units /</strong>
<p>1.	ADULT RESUSCITATOR WITH ADULT MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR BAG /	8, 244 /<br />2.	ADULT RESUSCITATOR WITH ADULT MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR TUBE 40-60 INCHES /	2, 570 /<br />3.	INFANT RESUSCITATOR WITH NEONATE/INFANT MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR BAG /	1, 581 /<br />4.	INFANT RESUSCITATOR WITH NEONATE/INFANT MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR TUBE 40-60 INCHES /	1, 682 /<br />5.	PEDIATRIC RESUSCITATOR WITH TODDLER/CHILD/PEDIATRIC MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR BAG /	786<br />6.	PEDIATRIC RESUSCITATOR WITH TODDLER/CHILD/PEDIATRIC MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR TUBE 40-60 INCHES /	854 /<br /><br />2.	Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.<br /><br /><strong>Item Descriptions /</strong></p>
<p>1.	PEDIATRIC RESUSCITATOR WITH NEONATE/INFANT MASK AND OXYGEN RESERVOIR BAG /<br />2.	ADULT RESUSCITATOR WITH MEDICATION PORT /<br />3.	INFANT RESUSCITATOR WITH MEDICATION PORT /<br />4.	PEDIATRIC RESUSCITATOR WITH MEDICATION PORT /<br /><br />3.	Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs): </span><br />Mr. Paul Davis, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, paul.j.davis.ctr@mail.mil, 808-433-3686; and Ms. Cora Toledo, RN, MMESO Pacific Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@mail.mil, 808-433-2894.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

	NON-PERSONAL SERVICES  - Non-Personal Health Care Services 
This contract is a non-personal services contract, under which the contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional services provided. The Contractor is required to indemnify the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the specialty concerned. 

THE CONSULTANT SHALL COMPLY WITH BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AS FOLLOWS:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation. Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

The award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirement herein and will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Gauze, Petrolatum. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Gauze, Petrolatum products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Gauze, Petrolatum in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Gauze, Petrolatum will be established approximately February 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Gauze, Petrolatum. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Gauze, Petrolatum.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Gauze, Petrolatum. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $261,069. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Twelve items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 99.34% ($259,335) of the total volume in sales ($261,069). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Infant Heel Warmers. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1512-66_Infant_Heel_ Warmers are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Infant Heel Warmer products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1512-66_Infant_Heel_Warmers. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL MS-1512-66_Infant_Heel_Warmers must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 08 October 2016. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Infant Heel Warmers.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required&nbsp;<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Infant Heel Warmers. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $207,541 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MS-1512-66_Infant_Heel_Warmers who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below. </strong>In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Daylight Savings Time (CDT) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /><br /></strong>1.	Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br /><strong>Item Descriptions</strong> \	<strong>Annual Usage in Units</strong> \
<p>Infant Heel Warmer, with tape \	223,400<br /><br />2.	Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted.  A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs): </span><br />Mr. Joe Winter, MMESO South Clinical Analyst, joseph.n.winter.ctr@mail.mil, 210-536-6072 or Mr. David Sheaffer, MMESO South Team Leader, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil, 210-536-6075.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Manual Resuscitators. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Manual Resuscitators products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Manual Resuscitators in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.  In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA.  Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Manual Resuscitators will be established approximately December 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately January 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Manual Resuscitators. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Manual Resuscitators.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Manual Resuscitators. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $282,667.60. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Six items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 93.34% ($263,852.48) of the total volume in sales ($282,667.60). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought Notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is co-chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />EVALUATION AND AWARD<br />The Government will evaluate and award contracts/ task orders according to the following:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.213-70 EVALUATION UTILIZING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (APR 2010)<br />The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible Quoters whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. After preliminary consideration of all quotations the Contracting Officer and selected technical advisors, will identify from all quotations received one that is suitable to the user. Our decision will be based on a professional analysis of readily discernible value indicators from your proposal.</p>
<p><br />I. EVALUATION FACTORS for Base (IDIQ) Award:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Capability. The Quoter will be given a suitability review measuring his general experience in Ship Building and Repair, per NAICS 336611 to include general experience, and the ability to handle surge capacity as described below at item (iii) below.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance.</p>
<p>Provide a list of no more than five customer references with contact information, project size in dollars, project date, customer, description and subcontractors used.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors. The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other Government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases. <br />If an offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating.</p>
<p>Price will not be an evaluation factor for the Base Award.</p>
<p><br />II. EVALUATION FACTORS: (All Task Orders)</p>
<p>(a) Technical Approach.</p>
<p>i. Technical &amp; Management Capability. <br />The Quoter will be evaluated on the range, experience and qualifications of company personnel, excluding subcontractors, relative to the range of capabilities required for ship repair. Describe experience in performing similar requirements, project manager experience and qualifications, key staff qualifications and experience, quality control procedures/program, in-house workforce crafts/trades and certifications, or other relevant information to meet the government's requirements as stated in the Specification, and through the submission and quality of its technical approach to each work item on the attached drydock ship repair specification .<br /><br />Provide the resumes of all Project Managers, Quality Assurance Manager and Ship Superintendents that may be assigned to oversee repair of NOAA vessels. See CAR 1352.237-75 - KEY PERSONNEL clause.</p>
<p>ii. Sub-contractor Qualifications. Provide experience and qualifications of readily available subcontractors relative the range of capabilities required for this ship repair. The Quoter will be evaluated on the range, experience and qualifications of each sub.</p>
<p>iii. Demonstrated Surge Capacity to maintain schedule. The contractor's plan to bring internal surge capabilities and assets to bear to meet or exceed acceleration/ surge challenges to schedule is vital. As such the prime contractor shall demonstrate their capacity to accomplish ship repair tasks on schedule with in-house, and external assets for this project and on past projects.</p>
<p>Request a by-trade/experience matrix showing the depth of your organizational manpower resources on permanent staff by trade and skill/grade and the available subcontractor workforce (i.e. the subcontractors needed for special work). The Quoter will be evaluated on the degree to which the plan addresses major risks, and the degree of preparedness demonstrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(c) Price Factor:</p>
<p>Price evaluations that lead to award of a task order will be based upon quoters' overall price for that respective Task Order. Quoters must submit pricing for the base and all optional items listed in the Task Order Pricing Schedule.</p>
<p>The Quoter need not offer a price quote for any task order published in this RFQ to be considered for award of a MATOC; however in order to be considered for a Task Order award, a price quote for that Task Order must be submitted. Prices will be evaluated for reasonableness and the contractor's understanding of the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work. All Quoters who are suitable technically will then be evaluated as to suitability of price. Prices that are determined to be unreasonably high or unreasonably low will not be considered for Task Order award.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD <br />Applies to subject task orders per attachments below:<br />(a) Award(s) will be made to the quoter(s): whose offer conforms to the RFQ requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9.1 by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose quote meets the requirements stated in this solicitation, to provide the best value to the Government in accordance with CAR 1352.213-70.</p>
<p>(b) The Government intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts and three Task Orders in response to this solicitation. The Task Orders may be awarded to more than one MATOC contractor. The Government reserves the right not to award a MATOC or Task Order depending on the quality of the quotes submitted.</p>
<p>(c) Evaluation of Quotes. All offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to make an award without conversations with any quoter based solely upon initial quotes. Therefore, quoters should ensure that their initial quote constitutes their best quote in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed.</p>
<p>(d) Negotiations. The Government reserves the right to engage in negotiations with all, some, one, or none of the quoters at any time during the evaluation process on any aspect of their quote.</p>
<p>(e) Task Orders. A Task Order will be awarded to the MATOC contractor that provides the overall best value to the government and has the capacity to accept the work requirements stated in the Statement of Work. Based upon the results of the integrated assessment of the technical and price quotes, the Government may award a Task Order to other than the lowest-priced quoter or the quoter with the highest technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

DESCRIPTION: ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A
STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.
THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT.
  A market research study was conducted by NAVFAC Southwest that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms. Upon review of the market research, the U.S. Small Business Administration
(SBA) in San Diego determined that a Small Business Set-Aside procurement is appropriate. The
NAVFAC SW small business office concurs with the SBA determination.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Interior Design Services. Projects under this contract will occur at various military installations located in the NAVFAC Southwest (SW) Area of Responsibility (AOR) (California, Arizona,
Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) and the NAVFAC Pacific AOR (Hawaii, Japan, Guam), but may be also available to the NAVFAC (AOR) as approved by the NAVFAC SW Chief of Contracting Office (CCO).
 Travel will be required to the project sites. The Offeror/Contractor must demonstrate adequate in-house staffing capability to self-perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract as required by FAR Clause 52.219-14(b) (1) Limitation on Subcontracting.

A-E Design and Engineering Services shall mainly provide for, but not be limited to, INTERIOR DESIGN related services. All A-E services will be in accordance with the scope of this contract, Industry Design
Codes and Standards and Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) such as Antiterrorism, Energy and Sustainable Design, Safety and Health Requirements. For this contract, the lead discipline shall be a certified Interior Designer.
 Acceptable certifications are a National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) certification or a state and/or jurisdiction Interior Design Certification, Registration, or License. The number of design task orders per fiscal year may vary and may involve surges of multiple projects with overlapping delivery dates.

A-E services required: The work will primarily include preparing Comprehensive Interior Design (CID) for various types of facilities. CID includes Structural Interior Design (SID) and Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF and E) Interior Design. SID includes selection and coordination of interior finish materials that are integral to or attached to the building structure.
 FF and E interior design includes design, selection, specification, color coordination, and procurement documentation of the required items. SID packages will typically include furniture floor plans, finish schedules, and any supporting interior elevations, details, or plans necessary to communicate the building finish design and build out. FF and E packages will typically include placement plans, ordering and finish information on all freestanding furnishings and accessories, cost estimates, and best value determinations.

Additional services may include the following: preparation of the interior design portion of a design-build
Request for Proposal (RFP) package, including developing the FF and E requirements and budget for the project; verification of equipment and finishes during building construction; consultation during FF and E procurement, delivery, and installation; supervision of furniture assembly and placement; developing standards for FF and E for a program or group of projects; and other related consultation.

Preparation of all interior design deliverables shall be in accordance with UFC 3-120-10, Interior Design.
FF and E specifications shall be based on Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA), General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and other Federal contracts.

The types of buildings/facilities may include, but are not limited to, administration buildings, academic facilities, maintenance facilities, hangars, industrial/warehouse, bachelor enlisted/officer quarters, recreational facilities, dining facilities, medical facilities, laboratories, and consolidated clubs.

The maximum contract value may not exceed $5,000,000 aggregate total.
 The minimum guarantee for the contract is $5,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order. The minimum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $5,000. The maximum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $400,000. There will be no dollar limit per year. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods. Each performance period will run 365 (366 for leap year) calendar days. The hourly rates will be negotiated for each performance period.
 The Government may exercise the option period unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c) (1), options for post-award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. The estimated start date is December 2016. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541410 (Interior Design Services) and the annual small business size standard is $7.5 Million.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Firms that provided Architect-Engineer services for a task order issued under the resulting contract are prohibited from participating on the subsequent construction contract.
 This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm. Firms or personnel shall not be affiliated with any furniture dealership, vendor, or manufacturer.

SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Selection of Architects and Engineers, formerly the Brooks Act (PL 92-582) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. The evaluation and selection will be based on the following criteria: Criterion 1,

Defense/Government contract, include the complete contract number, including the task order number if applicable.

In SF330, Part 1, Section F, Block 24, submit a description of the project, including: 1) Type of project and its relevance to the scope of this contract; 2) Specific interior design services performed by the firm (i.e.
CID, SID, FF and E, design-build requirements, supervision of installation, etc.); 3) Relevant sustainable features (see definition) incorporated in the project (if none or if not applicable to the project, affirmatively state so); and 4) A-E fee for the interior design portion of the project. Firms with multiple offices shall indicate which office(s)/branch(es) performed the A-E services.
 Each project may include an additional page with photograph(s) of the project interior design; the photograph pages will not count in the 30-page limitation.

For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project (see definitions), as is a stand-alone contract award. Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated. For purposes of this evaluation, recent is defined as professional services completed after November 23, 2009 and complete as of the SF330 due date. Completion is defined as the date that the final interior design services were completed.
 Projects not meeting these requirements will not be considered to demonstrate recent experience.

If the proposed team is a joint venture (JV), submit information for relevant projects completed by the JV entity. If the JV does not have shared experience, projects may be submitted for each of the JV partners.
In any case, do not exceed the ten (10) project limitation. In cases where the submitted project was performed by a JV, but all JV partners for that project are not on the team identified in Part I, Section C, specifically describe the relevant work performed by the JV partner(s) proposed for this contract.

In all cases, clearly describe the specific relevant interior design work self-performed by the proposing firm and the firms roles and responsibilities on the project; do not include work that is not attributable to the proposing firm.
 If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities teaming on this contract, the project may not be considered.

SF330, Part 1, Section G, Key Personnel Participation in Example Projects: Submit in accordance with the SF330 Instructions. From the total projects listed in Section F, provide a maximum of ten (10) projects.

SF330, Part 1, Section H; Additional Information requested by Agency: Address the remaining
Criteria 3 through 7; additional sheets may be used up to the 30 page limitation for Part 1, if required. See submission requirements. Clearly identify the Criterion number and title.

CRITERION 3, CAPACITY: The evaluation will consider the Offerors capacity to accomplish the work in the required time and the capability to self-perform at least 50% of the contract value with in-house staffing.

Submission Requirements: Submit a narrative that demonstrates the firms capacity to accomplish work in the required time frames, addressing the following: 1) Present workload and capability to integrate work under this contract with other work; 2) Methodology the prime A-E firm will use to execute a minimum of
50% of the contract value with in-house personnel; 3) Capacity to accomplish multiple task orders simultaneously with overlapping dates; 4) Ability of the firm to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of service; and 5) Strategy to meet surges in unexpected workload demand.

CRITERION 4, PAST PERFORMANCE: The evaluation will consider the Offerors past performance on relevant Government and/or commercial projects regarding quality of work, cost control, compliance with performance schedules, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on example projects presented in
Section F.
 The evaluation will be based on past performance assessments and other available past performance information. Points of contact provided in the proposal may be contacted. Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:
For projects provided as experience in Section F, list and provide copies of any applicable design awards received (copies are not counted in the 30-page limitation). Clearly indicate to which Section F project the award applies; otherwise the information may not be considered.

Submit an A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS), Contractor Performance Assessment
Report System (CPARS), or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.
 If a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package. If there is not a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project. If a PPQ is submitted, but an official ACASS/CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If an ACASS/CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330. If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract and client information for the respective projects.
 A-Es should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the
Governments point of contact, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, Code RAQ20.EP, Attn: Elliott Penetrante, via email at elliott.penetrante@navy.mil, prior to the response date. A-Es shall not incorporate by reference into their response ACASS/CPARS or PPQ evaluations previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. Submitted
ACASS/CPARS and PPQ evaluations will not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation and shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document(s).

CRITERION 5, LOCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY: The evaluation will consider the teams location, demonstrated knowledge of and project experience within the geographic areas where projects are anticipated for this contract.

DESCRIPTION: ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A
STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.
THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT.
  A market research study was conducted by NAVFAC Southwest that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms. Upon review of the market research, the U.S. Small Business Administration
(SBA) in San Diego determined that a Small Business Set-Aside procurement is appropriate. The
NAVFAC SW small business office concurs with the SBA determination.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Interior Design Services. Projects under this contract will occur at various military installations located in the NAVFAC Southwest (SW) Area of Responsibility (AOR) (California, Arizona,
Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) and the NAVFAC Pacific AOR (Hawaii, Japan, Guam), but may be also available to the NAVFAC (AOR) as approved by the NAVFAC SW Chief of Contracting Office (CCO).
 Travel will be required to the project sites. The Offeror/Contractor must demonstrate adequate in-house staffing capability to self-perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract as required by FAR Clause 52.219-14(b) (1) Limitation on Subcontracting.

A-E Design and Engineering Services shall mainly provide for, but not be limited to, INTERIOR DESIGN related services. All A-E services will be in accordance with the scope of this contract, Industry Design
Codes and Standards and Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) such as Antiterrorism, Energy and Sustainable Design, Safety and Health Requirements. For this contract, the lead discipline shall be a certified Interior Designer.
 Acceptable certifications are a National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) certification or a state and/or jurisdiction Interior Design Certification, Registration, or License. The number of design task orders per fiscal year may vary and may involve surges of multiple projects with overlapping delivery dates.

A-E services required: The work will primarily include preparing Comprehensive Interior Design (CID) for various types of facilities. CID includes Structural Interior Design (SID) and Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF and E) Interior Design. SID includes selection and coordination of interior finish materials that are integral to or attached to the building structure.
 FF and E interior design includes design, selection, specification, color coordination, and procurement documentation of the required items. SID packages will typically include furniture floor plans, finish schedules, and any supporting interior elevations, details, or plans necessary to communicate the building finish design and build out. FF and E packages will typically include placement plans, ordering and finish information on all freestanding furnishings and accessories, cost estimates, and best value determinations.

Additional services may include the following: preparation of the interior design portion of a design-build
Request for Proposal (RFP) package, including developing the FF and E requirements and budget for the project; verification of equipment and finishes during building construction; consultation during FF and E procurement, delivery, and installation; supervision of furniture assembly and placement; developing standards for FF and E for a program or group of projects; and other related consultation.

Preparation of all interior design deliverables shall be in accordance with UFC 3-120-10, Interior Design.
FF and E specifications shall be based on Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA), General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and other Federal contracts.

The types of buildings/facilities may include, but are not limited to, administration buildings, academic facilities, maintenance facilities, hangars, industrial/warehouse, bachelor enlisted/officer quarters, recreational facilities, dining facilities, medical facilities, laboratories, and consolidated clubs.

The maximum contract value may not exceed $5,000,000 aggregate total.
 The minimum guarantee for the contract is $5,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order. The minimum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $5,000. The maximum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $400,000. There will be no dollar limit per year. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods. Each performance period will run 365 (366 for leap year) calendar days. The hourly rates will be negotiated for each performance period.
 The Government may exercise the option period unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c) (1), options for post-award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. The estimated start date is December 2016. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541410 (Interior Design Services) and the annual small business size standard is $7.5 Million.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Firms that provided Architect-Engineer services for a task order issued under the resulting contract are prohibited from participating on the subsequent construction contract.
 This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm. Firms or personnel shall not be affiliated with any furniture dealership, vendor, or manufacturer.

<DESC><strong>Government Response to Potential Offeror Questions II:</strong>
<p>Q.2.1. Section 2.2.1 (Derived Waste), states: "The AST is equipped with a submersible pump and carbon drum for removal and treatment of water from the tank. The Contractor shall, as needed, pump water from the bottom of the AST through the carbon drum and discharge to ground surface. Accumulated LNAPL is periodically removed by PIADC personnel and stored on site until it is filtered and used to fuel a used-oil burner that provides heat to PIADC's warehouse." Is it the contractor's responsibility to replace the carbon drum (if necessary), and if so is that considered "routine" maintenance or "non-routine" (miscellaneous)?</p>
<p>Government Response: Misc funds. Carbon drum replaced every 4 or 5 years. Currently one-year old.</p>
<p>Q.2.2. Would it be possible to obtain an electronic copy of the most recent annual O&amp;M report (preferably), or one of the quarterly monitoring reports?</p>
<p>Government Response: <strong><em>See Annual Report Attached. <br /></em></strong>There is no requirement for quarterly reports. It is not on cost sheet but inadvertently left in SOW.&nbsp; <strong><em>Also, see revised SOW Attached, v.5 11.07.2016</em></strong></p>

<p>In order to effectively meet the program requirements, the contractor must have a final U.S. Government issued TOP SECRET security clearance for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access on the first day of contract award. Due to the security requirements of the work location, no work can be performed until appropriate facility and personnel clearances are obtained. Furthermore, a resultant contract has an inherent organizational conflict of interest and, thus, the contractor will be prohibited from bidding on or receiving an award for any other AFTAC contract for the duration of this contract.</p>
<p><strong>1.0 SOURCES SOUGHT INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1.1 AFTAC has a requirement for services to aid in developing, managing and operating an AFTAC Task Management system, and provide support evaluating and planning technical tasks ensuring AFTAC mission success.</p>

NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. THE GOVERNMENT MAY USE THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IN DETERMINING ITS ACQUISITION APPROACH.

<p>Contractor personnel for this requirement (1 FTE) will require a final adjudicated U.S. Government issued TOP SECRET security clearance for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access on the first day of contract award.</p>
<p>There is potential for this position to have access to financial information and possibly proprietary information resulting in an organizational conflict of interest, thus, the contractor will be prohibited from bidding on or receiving an award for any other AFTAC contract for the duration of this contract.

AFEI is accepting parties that wish to sign up for a waiting list.<br /></strong><br /><strong>A Government sponsored, no fee, Industry Day will be held at a future date upon further requirements definition.</strong><br /><br />Registration information is available at the Association for Enterprise Information's website - http://www.afei.org/events/7A30/Pages/default.aspx.</p>
<p>1) PCTE is a training platform that allows cyber mission forces to train in emulated network environments utilizing current cyber tool suites. The PCTE supports both individual and team training, in addition to large scale exercise and experimentation via a distributed close network across multiple classifications. The evolution of the platform will largely focus on integration of available applications, enabling increased automation to ultimately support multiple simultaneous training events. At maturity, the DoD joint PCTE will be a constellation of federated, interoperable common training capabilities enabling full spectrum training from individual competencies to the team, unit, group and force training, exercises, TTP development and mission rehearsal.</p>
<p>Currently, the DoD uses a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments that lacks the automation necessary to establish and maintain persistent and scalable training environments. Previous analysis efforts have detailed gaps associated with PCTE event planning, event management, training assessment, restoration of the training environments, and automated opposition force. The future of PCTE includes the development and evolution of new capability solutions focused on improving the timeliness and effectiveness to meet the requirements of fully functional cyber mission forces.</p>
<p>A Request for Information (RFI) was issued on October 17, 2016 requesting white papers providing possible technical solutions, capabilities, and critical cost/schedule drivers related to the PCTE. The full submission requirements for this RFI can be found at the following link: https://www.fbo.gov/notices/84b62e986a83e3378fcffd38454f65dd. <br /><br />2) The Innovation Challenge requirement will be released to the members of the Command, Control, and Communications in Cyberspace (C5) Consortium (c5technologies.org) utilizing Other Transaction Authority (OTA) as the vehicle to promote increased small and non-traditional industry engagement with Government. Selected industry partners from the consortium will be invited to demonstrate their system with training content provided by the Government. This Cyber Innovation Challenge will focus specifically on an unclassified training platform as part of the larger PCTE platform.</p>
<p>There is limited space available at this event so all interested parties should register as soon as possible at the registration link provided below. Attendees must provide Government issued identification upon arrival. Check in starts at 0800. Foreign Nationals may not attend this event.</p>
<p>Registration link: http://www.afei.org/events/7A30/Pages/default.aspx<br /><br /><br />/// Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in a 20-minute one-on-one session with the Government Project Management Office on November 2, 2016 from 0900-1200 and 1300-1600.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to clarify the Set-Aside Category for this Solicitation.
The solicitation is 100% set-aside for verified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) under Public Law 109-461, 38 U.S.C 8127 & 8128. In accordance with VAAR 804.1102 only verified SDVOSB firms are eligible to submit an offer or receive an award of a VA contract that is set-aside for SDVOSBs in accordance with VAAR Part 819. A non-verified vendor that submits a bid or proposal will be rejected as non-responsive or technically unacceptable as listing in VIP is not self-correctable as a minor informality as, for example, a listing in CCR or ORCA. All other purported SDVOSBs must apply for and receive verified status in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and be listed in VIP prior to submitting a bid or offer on an acquisition conducted in accordance with VAAR Part 819. The VIP database will be checked both upon receipt of an offer and prior to award. 
Any references to any set-aside categories other than the 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside should be ignored.

<DESC>This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement N00383-14-G-006D with Raytheon Company LLC, Indianapolis, IN (Cage Code 072E5). This synopsis serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by NAVSUP WSS in the time period from November 7, 2016 to November 6, 2017 against the subject BOA.

Individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under the Navy Weapon System covered by this BOA. A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact. 

Pursuant to this synopsis, orders issued against the subject BOA will be issued in accordance with 10 U.S.C.

<DESC>Upadated on 7 November 2016 to add the two phrases below.<br />Note: 3 page limit does not include Attachment 1. <br />Note: 1 Questionnaire (Attachment 1), is per product/capability. i.e. if an offeror has 3 capabilities/products of interest, 3 Questionnaires may be submitted.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Prolonged Field Care Training for Medical Simulation &amp; Training Systems
<p>KEY DATES<br />Response Date: 18 November 2016 (4:00 PM, Eastern Time)</p>
<p>ISSUED BY<br />The Joint Program Committee-1, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research, information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of The Joint Program Committee 1- Medical Simulation and Information Sciences Research Program (JPC-1) or the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). The JPC1 - Medical Simulation and Information Sciences Research Program (MSISRP) was established in fiscal year 2010 (FY10) to provide programmatic funding recommendations for Department of Defense (DOD) Health Affairs (HA) medical research, development, testing, and evaluation dollars related to medical training and education efforts to advance the development and integration of simulation-based training programs. This RFI seeks information regarding simulation training of prolonged field care (PFC) scenarios in which prehospital care provided under situations where doctrinal medical evacuation timelines are not met and teams are required to stabilize and treat patients longer at the point of care setting. The RFI seeks information from respondents to provide information regarding development of PFC designs, models, and simulation systems to support PFC training and education.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>This RFI is seeking organizations researching, developing, and offering a modeling and simulation system(s) for use in military medical education and training that extends beyond initial trauma care but is limited by evacuation options due to potential unlimited reasons.  Prolonged Field Care includes medical care applied beyond doctrinal planning timelines and is not limited to battle injury training.  Evidence collected from data-driven casualty estimations and disease or non-battle injury/battle injury rates are strongly encouraged for use to inform what injuries / pathologies need to be considered to be trained using medical simulation system(s). Work in this area should contribute to updating current or creating new military medical education and training materials or to develop and evaluate commercial off-the-shelf or new and/or integrated medical simulation systems.</p>
<p>The RFI is seeking interoperable, integrated, and open source/architecture systems that address the level of provider at a minimum of Role 1 and Role 2.  Role 1 is integral medical support or allocated to a small unit, and will include the capabilities for providing first aid, immediate lifesaving measures, and triage. Role 2 is typically at larger unit levels, usually of Brigade or larger size, though it may be provided farther forward, depending upon the operational requirements. Although not always, Role 2 may support surgical capabilities with the capabilities to perform emergency surgery and essential post-operative management.<br />This market research may assist with the further development and/or refinement of potential future announcements or solicitations.  Information will be reviewed pursuant to consideration for the development of future Requests for Proposal (RFP) or Announcements for potential research, development, and integration of technologies identified in this RFI.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The objectives of this RFI are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;	To identify developed simulation systems/models that are open source/open architecture to allow for future, yet-to-be-developed tools and systems to be inserted/integrated into a prolonged field care model / simulation system.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation systems/models designs that include the Physician, Physician Assistant, and Nursing populations that could represent scenarios in PFC environments.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation systems that can quickly incorporate accurate and appropriate environmental changes (heat/cold, dry/humid, mountainous/desert/ocean, etc.), team performance training, and different diseases/pathologies. <br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC within continuum of care training scenarios which needs to proceed until a successful handoff has been made with the next appropriate level of care no matter the duration involved for evacuation.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC that incorporate the full mission profile to ensure all aspects of mission are integrated to include technical rescues, insertion techniques, and tactical considerations and incorporating as many of the medical care military providers.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC that incorporate currently used medical instruments, tools, pharmaceuticals, natural remedies indigenous to the respective environment and products as well as identified emerging technologies that will enable more robust care to be provided closer to point of injury.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC that model morbidity and mortality based on skill level.  It is recommended that "advancement" or progression of injury, illness, or disease should be supported by an open source / architecture public physiology engine [platform].</p>
<p>Relevance<br />The information provided must be relevant to the following areas:</p>
<p>1.	Information must be relevant to, but not ALL exclusive to a military medical personnel population.<br />2.	Information must be relevant to medical personnel and must be applicable in one or more to the potential military medical education and training applications: Role 1: First Responder Care; Role 2: Forward Resuscitative Care; Role 3: Theater hospital care; Role 4: Overseas Definitive Care; &amp; Role 5: U.S. Definitive Care.  <br />3.	Information must be relevant to ruggedness, robustness, durability, longevity, portability, mobility, various environmental exposure, safety, and modularity. <br />4.
