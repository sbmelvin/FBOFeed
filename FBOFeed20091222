Description
This is a presolicitation notice for potential offerors interetested in privatizing the natural gas distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  
The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point where the distribution system enters the Installation, and Government ownership starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are the 107th Air Refueling Wing natural gas mains and laterals. Approximately 7,360 linear feet of polyethylene pipe supply natural gas to 16 buildings on the 107th ARW. These lines are owned by National Fuels Gas.  
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate natural gas distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. National Fuel Gas Company supplies natural gas to both systems. Within the boundary of 107th ARW, the gas distribution mains and laterals are owned by National Fuels Gas so they are not included in this offering. The natural gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base contains polyethylene pipe and iron pipe. The pipe sizes vary from 1 inch to 6 inches in diameter. 
Gas enters the 914th natural gas distribution system at the main entrance on Lockport Road. It is delivered through a pressure regulator that drops the pressure to about 5 psi for distribution through the 914th AW owned system. Roughly 3/4 of the gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base was replaced with new polyethylene pipe before 1999. Roughly 40 percent of the laterals were replaced; the remaining laterals are about the same age as the buildings they feed. A project to replace the remaining iron part of the gas main (installed in the 1950's and has reached the end of its useful life) is planned but not funded at this time. Gas is measured at the bulk meter near the regulator at the entrance to the site.
Inventories will be included in the RFP.
The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

Description
This is a presolicitation notice to potential offerors to privatize the wastewater distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, treatment plants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the wastewater collection system privatization are the oil/water separators, and grease traps.
	The wastewater collection system serves both the 914th AW and the 107th ARW. The wastewater collection system on the base contains both gravity and pressure flow sewer mains. Most of the collection system on the 914th ARW side of the base is PVC. In the early 1990s, a section of PVC pipe was installed as force main on the 914th side of the base. The wastewater collection system on the 107th side of the base consists of PVC pipe that was installed in 1996. Laterals connecting the buildings to the collection mains are typically cast iron and were installed with the buildings during the 1950s.
	Wastewater collection pipe diameter ranges from 3 to 12 inches. There are two wastewater collection pump stations on the Niagara Falls ARS and about 101 access manholes. Wastewater from the base is discharged through pump station 731 into a PVC force main to a manhole on collection main beneath Walmore Road east of the base. The receiving manhole belongs to Niagara County Sewer District No. 1. The wastewater for the entire base is metered at the Pump Station, Facility 731.
Wastewater discharge volumes are measured at the discharge pump station in building 731 on the Niagara Falls ARS wastewater system. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 reported the wastewater discharge to be 40 million gallons in 1994. In 1998, the base owned flow meter records show that 37 million gallons were discharged from the base. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 invoices the base for wastewater based on the meter in the pump station.
In calendar year 1998, the average monthly discharge was 3 million gallons per month. Peak discharge occurred in March 1998 at 6.7 million gallons, and the minimum monthly discharge was 1.4 million gallons in November. A net decrease in the square footage of buildings on the base is expected within the next 5 years as planned demolitions are completed. As a result, future wastewater system demand should decrease.
The 914th AW was issued an industrial waste permit with the Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 that expired June 1, 2000. Renewal of this permit was applied for by the 914th CEV.  Future permit renewals will be applied for by the 914th CEV.
	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.
	The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) plans to issue a Request for Quotes (RFQ) forThermal Protection Systems (TPS) materials for the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL)Technology Development Project (TDP).In October 2009, NASAs Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) established theEDL TDP, to be managed programmatically at Langley Research Center (LaRC) and technicallyat ARC.  The purpose of the project is to further the technologies required to land heavy(~40 metric ton) masses on Mars to facilitate exploration.  The EDL TDP contains threetechnical elements.  They are 1) Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) development; 2)Modeling and Tools (MAT) development; and 3) Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP)development.  The primary goals of the EDL TDP TPS element is to design and develop TPSmaterials capable of withstanding the severe aerothermal loads associated withaerocapture and entry into the Martian atmosphere while significantly decreasing the TPSmass fraction contribution to the entry system.  Significant advancements in TPSmaterials technology is needed in order to enable heavy mass payloads to be successfullylanded on the Martian surface for robotic precursor and subsequent human explorationmissions.  In July 2009 NASA released a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information fromTPS materials vendors regarding materials and concepts that could meet the initialrequirements derived from the Mars Design Reference Mission 5.0 architecture.  NASAsevaluation of industry responses to the RFI indicates that there are  promising TPSmaterials, technologies and concepts that could ultimately meet the stringentrequirements for Mars aerocapture and entry.  This procurement will consist of screeningtests of multiple TPS materials from multiple vendors within a detailed trade studyframework in order to advance promising concepts to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or6 by 2014.NASA intends to conduct a Progressive Competition in accordance with NASA FAR Subpart1817.73 Phased Acquisitions.  This presolicitation notice constitutes the requiredsynopsis for Phase 1.  To be considered for a Phase 1 award, offerors will have todemonstrate capability to perform all phases of this Procurement.  The following information applies to this phased acquisition process:(1) The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a competitivedown-selection process, as follows:Phase 1 is for delivery of TPS material coupons as described on the attached Statement ofWork  Phase 1.  NASA will perform a variety of tests on these submitted coupons, andresults of the testing will be evaluated as part of  the down-select to Phase 2.Phase 2 is for continued testing, development, extending the TRL, etc. for up to 4 rigidablator materials and for further screening of viable deployable ablator materials (seeattached Statement of Work  Phase 1 for more detail on types of ablators) . The downselect for Phase 2 is expected to be about Summer 2010.Phase 3 is for development and further characterization of up to two rigid ablatormaterials and up to three deployable ablator materials (see attached Statement of Work Phase 1 for more detail on types of ablators).  The down-select for Phase 3 is expectedto be about mid FY2012.Phase 4 is for further development and larger scale testing of the best materialsdetermined in Phase 3.	  The down-select for Phase 4 is expected to be in the beginningof FY2014.(2) Competitions for identified subsequent phases will build on the results of previousphases. (3) The award criteria for subsequent phases will include demonstrated completion ofspecified previous phase requirements. (4) The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors will be capable ofsuccessfully competing for the subsequent phase(s). Proposals for the subsequent phase(s)will be requested from these contractors. (5) The Government does not intend to issue a new, formal solicitation for subsequentphases.  This is a progressive competition in accordance with NFAR 1817.7301-5.  Towardsthe end of each phase, all contractors for that phase will be provided pertinentsubsequent phase proposal information (e.g., statements of work, specifications, proposalpreparation instructions, and evaluation factors for award) to be considered for the downselect to the next phase.(6) Each subsequent phase of the acquisition will be synopsized in accordance with FAR5.201 and 5.203. (7) Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase contractors will becapable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s), proposals from allresponsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered.  In order tocontend for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective offerors must demonstratea design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase contractors.  Failure to fullyand completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render theproposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.(8) Each subsequent synopsis during this process will identify the current phasecontractors.NASA/ARC is planning to award multiple non-commercial purchase orders for Phase 1.  ThePhase 1 procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures.  Later phases will include more complex requirements and areexpected to have higher contract values, with longer periods of performances, and arethus expected to be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.The tentative TPS for MARS EDL Phase 1 schedule is:  Issuance of Synopsis  December 22, 2009;  Issuance of Solicitation  January 6, 2010; Quotes/proposals Due  15 days following issuance of solicitation;  Multiple Purchase Orders awarded end January 2010All contractual and/or technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax)by January 4, 2010.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.	Please address anycomments or questions to: Marianne Shelley, NASA Ames Research Center.	Email: Marianne.Shelley@nasa.gov.  Fax: 650-604-3020.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Claremore, OK.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5,700 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.

Other applicable requirements include:

Parking:  42 hard surface spaces with adequate pull-through and turn-around to accommodate agriculture- related trucks and trailers.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it received in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or execute the renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

Please send written expressions of interest to: 

Nita Morris, Real Property Leasing Officer / USDA FSA, Oklahoma State Office / 100 USDA Suite 102 / Stillwater, OK  74074

Email: nita.morris@ok.usda.gov

Written expressions of interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 p.m. on January 11, 2010 and must include the following information:

	Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.
	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
	ANSI/BOMA Office are square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.  Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount if any.
	Date of space availability.
	Method of rentable space measurement
	Building ownership information
	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
	Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.

<DESC>RECOVERY - NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE FOR A LARGE FORMAT, HIGH SPEED, HIGH RESOLUTION NEUTRON IMAGING DETECTOR SYSTEM

RECOVERY  THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.  This Notice of Intent to Sole Source is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Sensor Sciences, of Pleasant Hill, California for the purchase of a Large Format, High Speed, High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

In addition, the high speed, high spatial (20 micrometers at 10% MTF) resolution resistive anode detectors required for the low electronic noise (less than 0.75 events per second per squared centimeter) and spatial resolution are only available from Sensor Sciences.  Further, only Sensor Sciences has publicly demonstrated a neutron imaging detector with spatial resolution less than 20 micrometer and greater than 15 % thermal neutron detection efficiency.

Sensor Sciences is the only manufacturer and distributor for the required Large Format, High Speed, High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector System, and no other suppliers can satisfy NISTs requirements.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on January 6, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. 

The resulting award will be posted on www.fedbizopps.com  in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6070, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.

Description

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis the brand name X-RAD 320 X-ray irradiation system upgrade, TOUCHRAD multi user control, Motorized sample shelf height adjustment, oil cooling pump, installation, training and shipping from Precision X-Ray, Inc.; 15 Commerce Dr. Unit 1; North Branford, CT 06471.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans and conducts pre-clinical and clinical research on the biologic and therapeutic effects of radiation administrated alone or in combination with other modalities of treatment; to develop novel technology, to investigate and understand optimizing treatment selections; and to provide radiation therapy and oncology consultations for patients. The ROB requires the use of a self-contained X-ray irradiation system for use in biology and medical research to deliver precise X-ray irradiation dosages in a radiation shielded enclosure.

The salient characteristics for the required system are as follows: 

The cabinet needs to be able to fit into a space 80h x 40w x 44d
Cabinet features 6 x 8 lead glass viewing window on door.
Cabinet Interior: Type 316 stainless steel with fixed height Specimen Shelf
User Entry Port for inserting small tubing or cables into Irradiation Chamber
Interior fluorescent light and AC outlet
Existing X-ray tube, beam filtering and collimation will be fitted into the new cabinet
Touchrad multi user control
Motorized sample shelf height adjustment
Oil cooling pump
Complies with 21 CFR 1020.40 Sub J for Cabinet Radiation Safety
Radiation leakage is less than 0.5mR/hr at 5cm from surface averaged over a 10cm2 area at 320kV, 13.5mA. (Maximum Tube Power)

The government will trade in towards the purchase the following:  Pantak Model HF320, Serial Number 07-1525.

The proposed XRAD cabinet is manufactured by Precision X-ray, Inc. (PXI), and is the same model supplied throughout the NIH/NCI campus ensuring identical performance, and experimental reproducibility. The current Pantak X-ray system being used in the ROB research lab was originally designed to operate to a maximum of 300 kV. The Tube is rated for voltages up to 320kV and needs to be brought to this level on a regular basis during the tube warm-up procedure.  Also, the higher kV yields a more uniform and deeper penetration when used for small animal irradiation.  The need for energy levels above 300kV during experimentation is dependent upon the experiment being performed. PXI was started by key technical staff from Pantak, no longer in business, and has manufactured all the XRAD products continuously since Pantak's closure. The X-ray source and power supply for this system were upgraded by PXI over the past 2 years and are configured to be drop in replacements for a new cabinet as well. The existing cabinet leaks radiation at >300 kV and is no longer cost effective to retrofit or repair. There is no other source for the XRAD cabinet.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on January 6, 2010.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquistions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-100019-TG on all correspondences.

<DESC>TAS14:: 1041TAS:: RECOVERY PARK XXXX, PMIS XXXXX.  The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, CO 80225 anticipates awarding multiple IDIQ Contracts to Install Gates or Otherwise Close Abandoned Mines to Protect Visitors and Preserve Resource Habitat and to Mitigate Safety Hazards.  This work will take place in multiple parks within the Pacific West Region and Intermountain Region.  This project has been approved for funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act.
General:  The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, will be soliciting proposals for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below. This solicitation will be issued electronically, on the U.S. Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) websites, at www.FedBizOpps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov.   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register on both websites. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF. Specifications and drawings will be available in Adobe PDF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at www.FedBizOpps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the websites for all information relevant to this solicitation and periodically checking for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent. 
Work will include one or more of the following: installation of bat compatible gates and other types of wildlife permitting closures, backfilling using on-site or other materials, plug closure using Polyurethane Foam (PUF), and installation of fencing.  Eighteen standard closure types will be matched to specific abandoned mine openings.  
Work will be conducted in a variety of settings, with various risks that necessitate careful execution of mine closure activities.  Many of these AML sites are remote which will, in some cases, make access difficult.  In certain cases, the NPS may uphold and enforce limitations on what types of vehicles and equipment can be taken to a job site, especially in the case of wilderness areas.          
Work will occur in the Pacific West and Intermountain Regions of the National Park Service (please go to www.nps.gov for further information regarding the geographical extent of this work).  The NPS seeks interest from firms who have extensive experience with mine closure activities.  
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  NPS anticipates competing and awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to HubZONE contractors to satisfy this need.  The NPS anticipates competing individual task orders for each project among all successful contractors awarded a contract under this solicitation.  Individual task orders will provide information regarding site location, required end product results, site restrictions and/or limitations, and required closure types for each AML feature.  Site visits will be highly encouraged.  
The term of the IDIQ contract shall be five years with a maximum deliverable to each firm not to exceed $6,000,000.00 per year.  There is a $25,000.00 guaranteed minimum extended to each firm selected which applies to the first year only.   
The NAICS codes for this procurement are 238190 and 238910.  The small business size standard is $14M.  The solicitation will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities and IDEAS/EC on or about January 19, 2010 with a response date of 30 days thereafter.
Payment and Performance bonds will be required on a per task order award.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) has recently raised the maximum contract amount that can be covered by an SBA guaranteed surety bond from $2 million to $5 million.  Small businesses can find further information regarding SBA bonding on www.SBA.gov.
All responsible HubZONE sources may submit an offer that will be considered. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
Additional Info:  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is an on-line system that is located on the Internet. Prior to ORCA, vendors were required to submit Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) for each individual large purchase contract award. Now, using ORCA, a contractor can enter their Reps and Certs information once for use on all Federal contracts. This site not only benefits the contractor by allowing them to maintain an accurate and complete record but also the Contracting Officer as they can view every record, including archives, with the click of a mouse. The ORCA site can be found by going to http://www.bpn.gov and clicking on "Online Reps and Certs Application" on the left side of the screen. If you do not have access to the Internet or feel you need extra Internet help please contact the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) (www.dla.mil/db/procurem.htm) closest to you.  You are strongly encouraged to register in ORCA in responding to this solicitation. You are required to have an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.CCR.gov in order to conduct business with the Federal Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit Innovative Professional Solutions of Panama City Beach, FL.32407-4804 for the Safety Support Requirements for the Assault Breaching System Countermine System Program on a sole source basis. This weapon system safety support requires the following expertise and experience from the Contractor:  (a) past experience supporting the ABS CMS safety program, including in depth knowledge and technical experience of existing ABS CMS weapon system safety analyses and documentation, as well as, unique system safety issues associated with the CMS weapon system, (b) familiarity and experience providing system safety support and developing weapon system safety documentation for the ABS CMS and similar US Navy weapons systems, and (c) significant experience developing successful data packages and presentations for the US Navy Weapon System Explosives Safety Review Board (WSESRB), Software System Safety Technic! al Review Panel (SSSTRP), and US Air Force Non Nuclear Munitions Safety Review Board (NNMSBB), in support of US Navy weapon systems programs, (d) significant experience in developing US Navy mine weapon system assembly, training, and technical manuals. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. IPS has the unique capabilities and knowledge required to support this effort.  No other vendor holds or maintains the technical expertise in the explosive safety program required to support this high priority safety program. Innovative Professional Solutions is a small business that has supported this effort the last two years. IPS has provided high quality weapon system safety support to the ABS CMS program previously on contracts N61331-09-P-4503, N61331-07-P-3025 and N61331-06-P-2129. It is estimated that getting another source trained and up to speed on this tasking would increase the cost to the Navy by as much as 100%. 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina intends to award a sole source contract with Keppler Speakers, 4350 N. Fairfax Dr., Suite 700, Arlington, VA  22203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 711410, Agents and Managers for Artists, Athletes, Entertainers, and Other Public Figures, with a small business size standard of $7M.  The EPA believes Keppler Speakers is the only source reasonably available that is capable of performance because they act as duly authorized representative for nationally recognized experts of the highest caliber to speak at various functions.
The EPA-RTP Management Council requires the services of such an organization to locate a speaker who is an expert in the field of environmental law to speak on the EPA-RTP campus for the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, April 22, 2010.  Such individual should have a unique niche in the environmental movement as a notable authority on environmental advocacy with unique contacts in the environmental field to include such accomplishments as authoring best selling books on environmental subjects, experience in negotiating international treaties regarding environmental issues and litigation of environmentally related lawsuits.  Keppler Speakers has provided reasonable rates for such individuals which the EPA-RTP campus can readily afford. 
Any interested firms who believe they can fulfill the requirements should submit a capabilities package fully demonstrating their capabilities, qualification and expertise no later than December 28, 2009.  The capabilities package should be sent electronically to powell.john@epa.gov.  Capabilities packages will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  
This notice of intent is not a request for proposal.  This is for informational and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  Any information submitted to this notice of intent is voluntary.  Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. Any questions in relation to this notice of intent must be submitted in writing via email to powell.john@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

The purpose of this project is to develop and conduct both a formative and summative evaluation of the Regional Extension Center Program and Health IT Research Center (Section 3012) required under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009. This program was created in an effort to provide technical assistance to support providers in purchasing, adopting, and becoming meaningful users of electronic health records. Without the active use and exchange of health information by health care providers, the United States will fail to achieve its overall goals of higher quality and more efficient health care for all Americans. The Office of the National Coordinator will award the grants in 2010.

This evaluation, required by HITECH, will focus primarily on the effectiveness of the grants in establishing technical assistance support for providers to adopt and become meaningful users of electronic health records. Information from this evaluation will provide timely feedback and information to help continuously improve the centers ability to support adoption by providers. An overall evaluation of the program will determine its effectiveness, as a whole, and results will be used in future funding decisions.  

The contractor selected for this evaluation will be required to cooperate with an ONC-funded contractor who will be performing a global evaluation to assess the combined impact of the HITECH programs.  A multiyear task order is anticipated with a period of performance for 48 months.

<DESC>Note! All correspondence must be submitted to the Contracting POCs.<br /><br />1. Part: U.S. Government Procurements<br /><br />2. Subpart: Services<br /><br />3. Procurement Classification Code: R-Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services <br /><br />4. Agency: Department of the Air Force<br /><br />5. Responsible Office and Address: Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Contracting Division (PKE); Mail to: AFNWC/PKE; Attn: Ms Cassandra L. Caputo; Bldg. 20604, Rm. B-9C, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5606.<br /><br />6. Notice Type: Notice Of Contract Action (NOCA) - Sole Source Follow-on Contract<br /><br />7. Subject: The technical support requirements in support of the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) for the 705th Combat Training Squadron (CTS) at Kirtland AFB, NM, are currently performed by Scientific Research Corporation (SRC), Atlanta, GA, under contract FA9453-05-C-0177. This contract was originally awarded as a small business set-aside on 4 April 2005. In order to ensure critical mission requirements continue upon this contract's expiration, 3 April 2010, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source 8 month follow-on (bridge) contract with the incumbent contractor, SRC, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. This authority allows for a follow-on contract for highly specialized services when award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Due to the specialized nature of the services being performed, the number and level of security clearances required, and the multitude of on-going projects (60 projects) requiring continuity due to being within testing and approval stage, if a follow-on contract award were to be made to other than the incumbent, there is a required 60-day transition period (starting 2 Feb 2010) to ensure proper project transition, with the successor contractor taking on full responsibility by 4 April 2010. Given the need for a 60-day transition period, this NOCA is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the DMOC needs as further described below. The sole purpose of the bridge contract is to ensure critical mission requirements continue while AFNWC/PKE completes a competitive small business set-aside source selection for the procurement of these technical services. The Sources Sought for the competitive source selection was posted on 14 Oct 09 through the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br /><br />8. Description of the Efforts Needed Statement Of Work (SOW). The mission of the 705 CTS is to "develop, integrate, and deliver a virtual Air, Space, and Cyber environment for Air Force, Joint, and Coalition combat training, test, and experimentation." This mission requires the 705 CTS to maintain a highly-qualified staff of government and contractor personnel with expertise in exercise design and execution, weapons systems integration and interoperability and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology development. The 705 CTS anticipates continued expansion of the DMOC mission primarily in the areas of seamlessly integrating the Theater Air Control System (TACS) at the operational and tactical levels of warfare, providing robust joint and coalition training, controlled interface and Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) operations, testing in realistic operational environments, integrating live and simulation environments, and experimenting with advanced weapons systems and evolving Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).<br /><br />Utilizing the DMOC and associated resources, the 705 CTS performs training, tests, and experimentation with military personnel operating live weapon systems and high fidelity simulations in a dense synthetic environment. DMOC resources include simulations of airborne systems; surveillance systems; airborne and ground command, control and communication systems; Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs); voice communications systems, data link systems; data loggers; network analysis tools; and intelligence systems. The battlespace is currently capable of simulating up to 50,000 simultaneous air and ground objects. Digital terrain databases include Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), Digital Feature Analysis Data (DFAD), and Controlled Image Base (CIB) imagery. Standards for Electronic Warfare and weather effects are under development and may be modeled. <br /><br />The DMOC is linked to a large number of military and contractor simulation facilities through point-to-point and wide area networks. Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA) and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) gateways and corresponding network components allow the DMOC to interface with a variety of joint Live Virtual - Constructive (LVC) simulation facilities. Translators are available to allow exchange of tactical data link messages between actual field equipment and simulation models.
<p>a. Objective: The offeror shall provide technical and analytical expertise for the execution of DMOC training events, tests, and experimentation activities and system development in support of battlespace operations. This effort includes program management and engineering support tasks. Contract deliverables will include, but will not be limited to, technical exercise plans, test schedules, acceptance test plans and reports, after action reports, technical reports, study reports, controlled interface and Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) ruleset and risk assessment documents, engineering analysis reports, engineering drawings, system, and technical architectures; simulation interoperability standards and technical schematics.<br />Based on current trends the estimated labor total for this scope of work is 3,500 hours per month. <br /><br />b. Mission Areas:<br />Efforts for the required support are broken into six Primary Mission Areas (examples provided are not exhaustive):<br /><br />1) Internal Training Events - DMOC internal training events include major exercise events such as Virtual Flag (VF) and smaller scale training events such as Warfighter Focused Events (WFEs), Joint Kill Chain Events (JKCEs), and Air Force Weapons School Training Events (WSTEs).<br /><br />2) External Training Events - External training event examples include Northern Edge (NE), Fleet Synthetic Training - Joint (FST-J), and Northern Goshawk (NG) exercises.<br /><br />3) Testing Events -Testing event examples include the Joint Command &amp; Control of Net-Enabled Weapons (JC2NEW) and Joint Fires Coordination Measures (JFCM) joint tests.<br /><br />4) Experimentation Events - Experimentation event examples include Defense of the Homeland Against Asymmetric Missile Attacks (DoHMA) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) events.<br /><br />5) Projects - The 705 CTS manages a large number of Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and facility improvement projects aimed at improving M&amp;S capability within the DoD and the international community.<br /><br />6) Distributed Warfighting Center (DWC) - As the integrator of United States Air Force (USAF) and LVC training, the 705 CTS provides the majority of manpower associated with DWC tasks and responsibilities.</p>

<DESC><p>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is seeking interested contractors to provide continuation of services to contract no. FA8819-04-C-0002 for Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Block 10 Space Vehicle (SV) storage in a launch ready state, launch processing, risk reduction, and on-orbit checkout of the SBSS Block 10 system. The Government intends to use the responses to this synopsis to assess whether or not a sole source contract is appropriate.</p>
<p>Contract no. FA8819-04-C-0002 was awarded to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems acting in capacity as the integrating contractor for a Boeing Company subcontract team. The Boeing team was responsible for the development, delivery, launch and operations of the space vehicle and ground elements. Due to delays in providing Government furnished launch services, the scheduled launch date of October 2009 was not met. FA8819-04-C-0002 will now be completed and a separate contract will be established for the activities described below. The Boeing team was responsible for the development, delivery, launch and operations of the space vehicle and ground elements and possesses highly specialized system knowledge to meet government requirements in a timely and cost efficient manner.</p>
<p>The scope of work will include: storage, maintenance and transportation of the SBSS Block 10 space vehicle; maintenance of the SBSS ground segment and engineering support hardware and software; resolving parts obsolescence and shelf-life issues; launch call-up and preparation activities, including processing at a designated payload processing facility; launch and early orbit support; on-orbit commissioning, checkout and calibration; and studies to support risk reduction and mission assurance. The performance of this effort requires highly specialized expertise and system specific knowledge of the space vehicle, ground segment, and launch vehicle interfaces. Performance of this requirement also requires access to proprietary hardware, software and engineering development units to which the Government does not own full data rights. The estimated period of performance for this effort is 1 June 2010 through 60 days after SBSS Block 10 launch. The SBSS launch date is currently estimated to be in December 2010.</p>
<p>Any persons or companies capable of fulfilling this requirement may submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) containing the following information: Company name; address; primary POC including phone number; technical description of the offeror's experience; technical knowledge of the Space Based Space Surveillance Block 10 space vehicle, ground segment, and launch vehicle interface; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; proof of security clearances for government evaluation; and credible performance, cost, and schedule information to provide sufficient system trade spaces for decision-making.&nbsp; Interested sources must have experience with: satellite storage, maintenance, transportation and launch preparation; expertise in technical space mission assurance and risk reduction that support SBSS system performance requirements; spacecraft and launch vehicle integration; launch and early orbit support; spacecraft commissioning; and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) sensor calibration. The contractor must also have sufficient personnel cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret-SCI accredited SCIF. SOCS shall include credible performance, cost, and schedule information to provide sufficient system trade spaces for decision-making</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses to this notice.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis should be submitted via email in electronic format MS Word 2000 or newer format, or PDF format and must conform to 8.5"x11" page size, type 12 font, with a maximum of 20 total pages (11"x17" foldouts with minimum 12 font are acceptable but will count as two pages.) Send SOCs to attention: Capt Jason Holman and Capt Jon Hobart or e-mailed to jason.holman@losangeles.af.mil and jon.hobart@losangeles.af.mil to be received by 4:00 P.M. PST on 15 January 2010. The technical POC's for this effort are: Lt Col Jeffrey Wiemeri, jeffrey.wiemeri@losangeles.af.mil, Phone (310) 416-1588 or Major Stephen Behm, stephen.behm@losangeles.af.mil, Phone (310)416-1765. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with the points of contact. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 employees. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. However, all businesses must be able to perform the requirements listed above at the time of submitting SOCs.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James Gill, USAF AFSPC SMC/PK at (310) 653-1789.</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality ContractingCenter, Picatinny Arsenal, N.J.07806-5000 in support of the Project Manager Combat Munition Systems (PM-CAS), Picatinny Arsenal is currently seeking qualified sources to determine the qualifications of private industry to manufacture any of the following Large Caliber Metal Parts:


Artillery 155mm Metal Parts, M795; Mortar Shell Bodies 120mm, Smoke M929, High Explosive M933A1/M934A1, Illumination M930/M983 (front & rear), Full Range Training Cartridge XM931.


The Government anticipates soliciting offerors for award of multiple Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to deliver the Army and Marine Corps FY11-FY20 Large Caliber Metal Parts production requirements.  It is anticipated that multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded for a basic period of five years with an option that may be exercised to extend each contract for an additional five year period. Each item shall be proposed upon individually and shall be evaluated separately.  A TDP is not available for this Market Survey.  Should an RFP be released, a TDP shall be provided.  Also, should an RFP be released, and an offeror desires to propose on more than one item, a separate proposal shall be submitted for each item.  The USG may also issue split awards on a given requirement in an effort to foster future competition.   Potential contractors possessing the technical, financial and facility resources necessary to meet the Governments requirements will initially be qualified by being awarded an IDIQ contract and then compete for delivery orders as requirements arise.  All facilities must have safety clearance to handle hazard classifications (i.e. 1.3G).


Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience and capability, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the required quantities of Large Caliber Metal Parts and obtain the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver the above stated Large Caliber Metal Parts at a high rate of production.  The Large Caliber Metal Parts make up the shell bodies which are hollow cylindrical steel shells, topped by an open ogive-shaped nose, with a closed boattail at the rear of the projectile.  The front end has a female thread that will be assembled with a lifting plug during transportation and handling.  A metal rotating band encircles the projectile near the base end. There are two types of artillery shell bodies being procured; High Explosive (HE) and Smoke/Illuminating.


For purposes of this market survey, the following approximate quantities represent a high rate of monthly production for each item:


Artillery 155mm Metal Parts, M795 9,000 per month; Mortar Shell Bodies 120mm, Smoke M929 TBD, High Explosive M933A1/M934A1 10,000 per month, Illumination M930/M983 (front & rear as a set) 5,000 sets per month, Full Range Training Cartridge XM931 10,000 per month.


The information submitted may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a required production line.  Contractors shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience as a manufacturer, proven monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the company is a large or small business.  Contractors shall also identify the specific item(s) that they are interested in when responding to this market survey.


This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.  The Government will not reimburse any respondent for any effort or information submitted in response to this sources sought.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status and will not be returned.  The contractor shall provide all information requested in this notification by January 15, 2010 by electronic mail at no cost to the Government, to michael.anthony7@us.army.mil.  Telephone (973) 724-3432. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email.


If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.


The point of contact for this action is Mr. Michael Anthony, Contract Specialist, CCJM-CA, (973)724-3432

Return Review Program (RRP)
December 22, 2009

GENERAL INFORMATION

Document Type:
Request for Information

Contracting Office:
Modernization Acquisition Branch

Point of Contact:
Shontae Harley
Contract Specialist


BACKGROUND

 The Return Review Program (RRP) is a mission-critical, automated system that will be used to enhance IRS capabilities to detect, resolve, and prevent criminal and civil non-compliance thereby reducing issuance of fraudulent tax refunds.  The 1993 Malcolm Sparrow Report determined that annual losses estimated at several billions of dollars were attributable to paper and electronic tax returns fraud and identified a gap between the IRS technological service competence and its technological compliance competence.  In 1994, the Palmer Task Force recommended to Congress that a pre-refund automated fraud control process be developed to significantly reduce IRS losses from fraudulent tax refunds.  The IRSs Questionable Refund Program (QRP) has as its objective the timely detection, investigation and prevention of questionable tax return-based refunds.  The current-state QRP uses a data-driven approach that depends upon the Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) capabilities to store and process large data sets, mine data to identify questionable refunds, query data to identify individual and mass non-compliance which may lead to the identification of potential criminal investigations, and to conduct research, trigger the required taxpayer notifications, and monitor aging and status.  

The Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) is used to detect potential fraud of tax refunds in individual income tax returns (IRS form 1040).  As the system ages, it has been unable to keep up changes in the tax code or current business priorities.  The IRS has determined that a replacement for EFDS is needed, and has designated this application as the Return Review Program (RRP).  RRP will take the existing EFDS functionality, and improve it by adding new features, a more robust scoring ability, and making the system in line with the IRS Enterprise Architecture.

OBJECTIVE

To achieve RRPs objectives, the IRS has determined that a system will be created in four Transition States as defined below.  Overall functionality of the system must include data mining and modeling, predictive analytics, fraud scheme detection, real-time fraud scoring, workload management and work stream identification based on fraud score card analysis, as well as the ability to incorporate real-time business rule changes.

Transition State One (TS1) will create a new relational database with tools to assist in detection and prevention of fraudulent submissions

1.Provide data interfaces

2.Provide dynamic pattern recognition across tax returns

3.Provide analytical tools to predict future fraud


Transition State Two (TS2) will replace the current Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) functionality.  EFDS is an automated system that is used to maximize fraud detection at the time tax returns are filed to eliminate the issuing of questionable refunds.  EFDS supports the following business capability needs:

o Receive and maintain large amounts of data from a variety of sources (internal and external).
o Execute data mining algorithms to develop data models that identify questionable and fraudulent returns.
o Establish tolerances to create workload inventories.
o Assign and transfer workload.
o Review potentially false tax returns and develop scheme referrals 
o Capture statistical information and track the status of schemes. 
o Track employer contact information and W-2 verification status.
o Record the disposition of a return.
o Compare current year return information to previous years 
o Analyze business entity information.
o Readily see if the taxpayer worked for the same employer in the previous years and whether the income reported on a return matches information submitted by employers.
o Case Processing
o Inventory Management
o MIS reporting 
o Case Treatment Streams

In addition, the new system will:

1. Consolidate five current disparate applications into one single integrated application

2.Provide a single authentication and establish role-based authorization process though a web-based interface using the IRS Intranet

3. Enhance capabilities for real time rule changes as new issues are discovered or inventory levels change

4. Run new system in parallel in EFDS until the IRS determines full operational capabilities are replicated and reliable.

5. Improve case processing by establishing support rules for assignment of cases differentiated by type/timing to work, e.g., partial refund, etc.

6. Enhance inventory management by making it easier to adapt to change, moving inventory, adding new PODs for delivery of inventory, etc.



 Transition State Three (TS3) will add additional functionality to assist in pre-refund issue detection

1.Enhance ability to scan business tax returns for fraud detection

2. Enhance early detection of multiple issues through real-time scoring

3. Identify potential new treatment streams, noncompliance patterns, and tax return preparer issues



Transition State Four (TS4) will enhance interfaces to internal and external interfaces in and outside the IRS

1. Create external interfaces that will allow data to be provided directly from identified stakeholders (Social Security, large corporations)

2. Enhance interfaces with existing IRS systems

3. Tracking the effectiveness of various fraud detection treatment streams

Vendors must meet the requirements of the IRS Enterprise Architecture and section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of 8(a), small businesses to provide the requirement for Front Desk Clerks as outlined below. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nations foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. It is comprised of twenty-seven Institutes, Centers, and Divisions. The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) is the onsite hospital for the NIH campus, providing full support for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings.  The 870,000 square foot complex consists of 242 inpatient beds and 90 day hospital stations.  The CRC connects to the existing Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center.  Together, the Magnuson and Hatfield centers form the NIH Clinical Center, the worlds largest clinical research complex serving a dual role; providing humane and healing patient care as well as the environment clinical researchers need to advance clinical science.  

Patients are admitted to the Clinical Center for the sole purpose of Clinical Research as prescribed in a clinical research protocol. They may be self referred or referred by their primary care physicians. The Clinical Center admits patients from all over the world for clinical trials and natural history studies. The Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge at NIH offers a home-like place of respite for families and loved ones of adult patients who are receiving care.  Patients from across the nation and throughout the world visit NIH to participate as partners in medical discovery. Often they are experiencing serious illness and undergoing intensive medical treatments. It's important and necessary for patient families and loved ones to be nearby during these difficult and often stressful times. The Safra Family Lodge provides a home away from home by providing space for solitude, family meetings and supportive fellowship. 

Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for providing the highest level of customer service by greeting and welcoming guests upon arrival at the Lodge. The contractor will be responsible for issuing electronic (Onity/Tess) guess room keys to and controlling entrance to specific rooms that service guests (e.g., business center and exercise room). The contractor will also be responsible for assisting guests with information regarding the Family Lodge, general Clinical Center information facilities and local information and attractions. 8(a) companies interested in responding to this requirement should submit a capability statement with the following information: Capability statements should discuss current work being done or work completed that is the same or similar in nature. Specifically, please discuss in detail the requirements that were satisfied, number of people, period of performance and any other information you may feel is important. Also, please discuss your plan of operation for these references. Specifically, please discuss quality control methods that were in place to ensure a successful operation. In addition, please provide an overview of your company that will demonstrate stability and expertise in providing the services required. Please discuss your ability to obtain and retain capable, responsible employees who are professional and sensitive to the needs of patients and their families at the NIH. Employees should possess a proven track record of being courteous and professional. Employees should also have good communication skills, both verbal and written and must possess basic computer skills and computational ability. This capability statement must also state business size, and whether or not the firm has been approved as a 8(a) under applicable NAICS Code 561210, respectively. Capable firms shall provide three copies of a capability statement to the attention of Malinda Dehner at the below address within (15) days from the date of this notice. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) additional twelve (12) month periods. This is a market survey and does not constitute the synopsis announcement for the actual solicitation. SEE DRAFT SOW

<DESC>A.	GENERAL OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS1.	TITLE OF PROJECTQUALITY MANAGEMENT DEVLOPMENT CONTRACT TO VALIDATE PHILADELPHIA VAMC JOINT COMMISSION, CARF, PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY, CONSULTATION, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES.2.	PURPOSE OF PROJECTAlthough this project is the continuation of the successful work of Joint Commission readiness, it is not just a Joint Commission readiness project. In order to successfully pass the Joint Commission, an organization cannot just do a last minute ramp up. It is imperative that organizations understand systems and processes. It is equally important to understand and operationalize a quality outcomes management philosophy and structure. This structure should be able to address both the outcomes of organizational processes but also address the individual outcomes of veterans receiving care. In addition patient safety initiatives must be integrated into all organizational systems. In order to do this multiple integrated systems must be evaluated and in some cases redesigned. Therefore the purpose of this project is to: analyze and evaluate current Joint Commission (JC) and CARF readiness, continue the evolution of the quality program in order to be one of proactive improvement rather than reactive quality assurance, provide staff development in the areas of systems and process re-design, work with leadership on critical care and other processes, facilitate the development of a comprehensive patient safety program. Emphasis will be placed on system design and compliance, performance improvement, quality outcomes management, tactical and operational planning and staff analysis and development. The end result would be the on-going state of Joint Commission and CARF readiness rather than a staff intensive, resource intensive, ramp up at the last minute.BACKGROUNDBeginning in 2004, Joint Commission (JC) launched a comprehensive and far reaching new survey process. This process requires an accredited organization to submit self-assessments or periodic performance reviews for each of the JC functional chapters. After the completion of the self assessment, Philadelphia VAMC is required to submit corrective action identified through the self assessment process. Therefore the accuracy of the assessments and the ability to comply with corrective action is paramount to a successful survey. Additionally, the JC will do a systems analysis of key processes, so organizations must have effective systems in place. This approach requires that Philadelphia VAMC look at processes across its organizations and not just at a simple point in time. Finally, the JC will be evaluating critical processes that are specific to the Philadelphia VAMC relative to reported events, complaints, data base searches etc. A tracer methodology is used by Joint Commission. This system traces patients through care processes to identify strengths, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, trends and patterns.  In addition the Community Living Center at Philadelphia VAMC requires intense focus on patient care process and systems particularly as they relate to CMS standards. At the current time it is critical that action plans for improvement be monitored for effective implementation. All of these factors necessitate the need for consultative service. This contract is  an organizational development contract. The end result of contracted services would be a continued state of Joint Commission and CARF readiness, but more importantly, improved patient care and safety, as well as staff and leadership processes and outcomes. 3.

The contractor will provide comprehensive on site assessment, education and consulting in Joint Commission readiness and CARF readiness, quality outcomes management, patient safety, quality improvement and organizational development. Additionally, the contractor will facilitate all performance reviews conducted by Philadelphia VAMC.This contractor will provide this service for all the Philadelphia VAMC clinical areas including: the methadone program, the in-patient behavioral health program, the out-patient addictions recovery program, the Community Living Center, the hospital and all the primary care ambulatory sites and the Home Based Primary Care program.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources.  Only small business sources should respond to this sources sought synopsis.  

Project Title:  2012-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)

Project Description:  The purpose of the NSDUH is to provide current data on substance use and mental health prevalence for the U.S. population (aged 12 and older) and each state, and to issue reports on survey results.  The survey sample will support annual estimates of prevalence for the nation, the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  The contractor will be required to: (1) provide sufficient numbers of interviewers and interviewer supervisory staff to screen approximately 190,000 dwelling units and conduct 67,500 interviews per survey year, using computer-assisted interviewing technology; (2) develop training procedures/materials and conduct training classes in order to maintain a sufficient, qualified field staff and satisfy survey fieldwork goals; (3) use statistical expertise to (a) employ a 50-state sample design, with an independent, multi-stage area sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and (b) employ small area estimation techniques in order to develop model-based state estimates; and (4) perform technical writing, analysis, and methodological studies to complete and support the contract tasking.  

The NSDUH will also include a Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS). The purpose of the MHSS is to generate a mental health module for NSDUH that can provide accurate estimates of the prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) among adults (aged 18 or older) at National and State levels.  Data collected from an annual follow-up sample of 500 NSDUH respondents will be used to calibrate the NSDUH mental health screening scales, if necessary.

Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method.  Page limit: Maximum 15 pages (Times New Roman, font size 10 or larger).  A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted, as supplemental information.  The anticipated period of performance is 58 months.  After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.  

Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and must respond to the following questions: 

1.	Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? 
2.	Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business?

7.	Describe your proven capability for identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified field interviewers and field management staff. 
8.	Describe your proven capability for the design and selection of multi-stage area probability samples.
9.	Describe your proven capability for managing and providing leadership to a potentially large group of statisticians, survey methodologists, computer programmers, clerks, coders, field interviewers, and other staff that would be devoted to this project. 
10.	Describe your proven capability for writing and submitting successful OMB clearance packages to ensure that the product meets the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and other OMB requirements.
11.	Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity for creating, managing, and documenting multi-site databases and ensuring the security and integrity of data.
12.	Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to provide technical assistance and manage communications in a variety of formats and media, including site visits, training, telephone and teleconferences, presentations, email, meetings, workshops, and conferences. 
13.	Describe your proven capability for analyzing data, including secondary analyses of large data sets employing complex sample designs (e.g., multi-stage area probability samples, multiple frame designs, etc.).
14.	Describe your proven capability for producing technical reports of analytic studies that assist in program monitoring and policy development.
15.	Describe your proven capability in responding to a variety of requests for information with quick turnaround times and for presenting information about complex survey issues to a variety of audiences, both orally and through written materials.
16.	Describe your staff capability regarding formal academic training and relevant experience to perform the proposed tasks.  
17.	Describe your proven capability for conducting meeting planning and providing logistical support.  
18.	Describe your familiarity with various mental health assessment tools, such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) and the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale.

Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the US Customs and Border Protection Procurement Directorate intends to issue a modification to contract number HSBP10-04-C-000193, an Alaska Native Corp 8(a) awarded Cost-Plus Award-Fee Prime Integration Contract (PIC) for the Integrated Logistics Support and Maintenance of Government-Owned high technology, non-intrusive inspection equipment, awarded to CTSC, LLC formerly Chenega Technology Services Corp,  5911 Kingstowne Village Parkway, Suite 300, Alexandria, VA 22315.   The modification will increase the scope of effort originally contracted for and  increase costs associated with furnishing  project-specific support for the Office of Border Patrol (OBP) consisting of, but not limited to, engineering and project management support, problem resolution, acquisition and installation of project-specific new equipment, and minor construction (less than $2,000) in direct support of specific projects separately identified and funded by OBP. Any such acquisition and installation shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented by the Department of Homeland Security. 

This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems. This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) The contractor is already in the midst of project-specific support for OBP and this new work is needed to complete the current projects and any new projects as a result of unforeseen site conditions. 2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each individual site. 3) The contractor is responsible for the complete logistics/deployment support, maintenance, and repair of all OBP inspection equipment 4) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during project performance. 5) This contract enables specific projects to begin immediately after need identification and funding without a separate detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the equipment and facilities are out of service and the impact on border crossing and commerce. CBP Procurement Directorate intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet its requirements. The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. Furthermore, the existing contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work. Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government to use the existing PIC contract to accomplish the requirements listed above.

Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement shall be emailed to the Contracting Officer

<p>Salient Characteristics:</p>
<p>1. Efficiency</p>
<p>The Storage Device must use both inline deduplication to prevent the storage of duplicate data blocks and compression to maximize disk utilization.</p>
<p>&bull; Inline deduplication must automatically recognize duplicate patterns in the backup stream in real time and only store unique blocks. Devices not capable of true inline deduplication or devices that require disk space to ingest and store non-deduplicated data will not be accepted. <br />&bull; Deduplication process must utilize a sub-file variable-length segment recognition and filtering process that works at block sizes as small as 4 kilobytes to maximize efficiency. Systems that use fixed blocks will not be accepted. <br />&bull; After data is deduplicated, the Storage Device must automatically compress the deduplicated data before writing to disk for additional storage savings. Storage devices not capable of data compression will not be accepted. <br />&bull; Deduplication must be performed across the entire Storage Device to maximize efficiency. Storage Devices that deduplicate only within a volume limits efficiency and will not be accepted. <br />&bull; All recoveries must be from data at rest in a deduplicated and compressed state</p>
<p>2. Assured Data Recovery</p>
<p>Automatic verification, integrity checking and system resiliency to ensure all data will be accurately restored when needed.<br />&bull; The Storage Device must perform an automatic verification at the time of backup to ensure that all data is protected on disk as it was written to support reliable accurate restores. <br />&bull; Capability to automatically notify the administrator in the event the verification process discovers a discrepancy. <br />&bull; Automatic integrity-checking and self-healing to include fault avoidance and containment, on-the-fly error detection and correction, and automatic file system recoverability. Process to continually verify that the data stored on the system can be accessed, re-assembled and presented in its original form. <br />&bull; Storage Device hardware must be resilient with hot-swappable components and must utilize RAID-6 to protect against data loss and service disruption associated with dual drive failure within same RAID group. <br />&bull; System must be capable of digitally shredding deleted data without disrupting valid data</p>
<p>3. Capacity and Performance <br />&bull; Storage Device requires minimum of 20 TB of capacity to retain at least 30 days of backups in data center footprint no larger than 3 rack units <br />&bull; System must be capable of completing ingestion/deduplication/compression of backup data at speeds greater than 1TB per hour <br />&bull; System must be able to complete full backup in fewer than 8 hours to result in all data protected on disk in a deduplicated and compressed state</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Interoperability and Expandability<br />The Storage Device shall be a self-contained disk system (i.e. appliance) that is simultaneously configured as a Virtual Tape Library and a NAS system.</p>
<p>&bull; All backup/recovery administration shall be performed using the CommVault enterprise backup/recovery software <br />&bull; Deduplication, compression and verification process shall be automatic and work seamlessly with all client data <br />&bull; System must be capable of supporting future replication/DR requirements such that deduplicated data starts replicating when backup starts to achieve Recovery Point Objectives <br />&bull; System must be capable of supporting future nearline/archiving requirements via NAS interface and must be able to deduplicate all data regardless of interface or application <br />&bull; Architecture must be expandable and scalable in both capacity and performance to at least 3 times the original size.</p>
<p>5. Replication<br />The Storage Device must be able to replicate deduplicated data over the Wide Area Network to like system at DR/COOP site to achieve daily off site data protection in bandwidth efficient manner.</p>
<p>&bull; System must be capable of preventing duplicate data blocks from being transmitted to DR/COOP system to maximize efficiency of available WAN bandwidth <br />&bull; Replication technology must be able to start replicating deduplicated data as soon as the backup starts. Technology that cannot start replicating until after backup/deduplication ends will not be accepted. <br />&bull; Replication must be automatic and take place in real time to result in copy of backup data protected at DR/COOP site after completion of backup job. Every backup job must be protected on disk in deduplicated state at both primary site and DR/COOP site every day to achieve RPO/RTO. Technology that requires replication scheduling or that cannot replicate deduplicated data during the backup window will not be accepted. <br />&bull; Restore performance on all backup jobs at DR/COOP site must be equal to the restore performance on all backup jobs at the primary site. <br />&bull; Replication TCP port must be configurable and bandwidth throttling capability must be built into the system.</p>
<p>6. Past Performance<br />&bull; Product must be at version 3.0 or later and must have been generally available in the market for at least four years <br />&bull; Product must have no fewer than 40 customers in the Department of Defense using the deduplication technology in production environments</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-10-1067252 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).   The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 813920.   The Government anticipates a fixed price contract with One Base Year and Four Option Years.


Please attachment A for the price structure.


I.  Description of Services for FDA Laboratory accreditations.

Third party assessments of FDAs twelve field laboratories to maintain accreditation status in compliance with the ISO 17025 and the AOAC Food and Pharmaceutical Program.

FDA has 12 field laboratories that are currently accredited to ISO 17025 and the AOAC specific requirements for food and pharmaceutical testing.  The on-site assessments occur every two years. The assessment schedule alternates with seven laboratories in one year and then the other five laboratories the next year; the schedule repeats itself for the following years.

Example:  7 labs are assessed in 2010; then the other 5 labs in 2011; 7 labs are assessed in 2012; then the other 5 labs in 2013; and 7 labs in 2014.

The following disciplines or fields have been identified: Chemical, Biological, and Mechanical.  Four of the twelve field laboratories have only one discipline (Chemical); a one field laboratory has all three fields; seven laboratories have two fields (Chemical and Biological).  

I.1. Technical Requirements
The contractor shall conduct third-party assessments on the identified schedule (see B.3) for twelve laboratories for compliance to ISO 17025 and the AOAC Food and Pharmaceutical Program. The accrediting body is nationally and internationally recognized and has established recognition MOUs with other national and international organizations and accrediting bodies. The following are the assessment requirements:

I.2. Pre-Onsite  Requirements
Upon receipt of award, the vendor shall arrange for one or more assessors to conduct an assessment at the laboratorys site prior to the expiration date of the Accreditation Certificate for that specific laboratory.  See the attached pricing structure for the laboratory accreditation renewal dates.


Prior to the assessment beginning, the FDA Laboratories will provide the assessor team all quality documentation requested, as well as the laboratorys representative technical SOPs. The quality manual and related documentation must be reviewed by the assessor team before the assessment can begin. This review shall be done before the assessor(s) come on-site for the scheduled assessment. Upon review of submitted documentation, the assessor(s) shall provide the document review results to the laboratory in writing before the scheduled onsite assessment, and may ask the laboratory to implement corrective action to fill any documentation gaps required by ISO/IEC 17025 before the scheduled assessment.  Prior to scheduling the full assessment, the assessor(s) shall review the draft scope(s) to determine the tests they shall witness and checks on the availability of the technical personnel who perform the tests. An assessment agenda shall be provided by the assessor at least a week before the scheduled date of the assessment. 

I.3.  On-Site Assessment
Assessments may last from one to four days depending on the extent of the desired scope, number of disciplines, and the size of laboratory. The contractor shall provide the assessors with an assessor guide and checklists to follow when performing an assessment. All of the guidelines shall be consistent among the assessors in the various laboratories.  
An entry briefing with laboratory management is conducted by the assessor(s).  At the entry briefing, the assessor(s) review the assessment agenda and if any changes are necessary due to scheduling conflicts. This briefing lasts approximately 30 minutes.  
Interviews with technical staff are conducted from the staff matrix document submitted from the laboratory as part of the document review.  Interviews consist of the sample analysis process for a specific technology and/or method.    Assessment can also include a demonstration of selected tests or calibrations by the appropriate technical staff.  The assessor(s) shall examine the equipment and calibration records.  The assessor(s) audit the management system to verify that it is fully operational and that it conforms to all sections of ISO/IEC 17025, the accrediting bodys requirements, and the AOAC requirements, including documentation.  A written report of the assessor(s) findings is presented at the close of the assessment.   An exit briefing with staff is conducted to go over the findings which are identified as deficiencies in the written report.
A deficiency is any nonconformity to accreditation requirements, including:
(1)  A laboratorys inability to perform a test, type of test, or calibration for which it seeks accreditation.
(2)  A laboratorys management system does not conform to a clause or section of ISO/IEC 17025, is not adequately documented, or is not completely implemented in accordance with that documentation.

(3)  A laboratory does not conform to any additional requirements of the accrediting body or specific fields of testing or programs, such as AOAC, necessary to meet particular needs.  


I.4. Laboratorys Response to Deficiencies
The FDA laboratory is requested to respond, in writing, detailing either its corrective action or why it does not believe that a deficiency exists. This response is due 30 days from the close of the assessment. The corrective action response must include the laboratorys root cause analysis and a copy of any objective evidence (e.g., calibration certificates, lab procedures, paid invoices, packaging slips and/or training records) to indicate that the corrective actions have been implemented/completed. It is entirely possible that the laboratory will disagree with the findings that one or more items are deficiencies. In that case, the laboratory is requested to explain in its response why it disagrees with the assessor(s).

Accreditation shall be granted for two years.  An Accreditation Certificate of successful completion is issued by the accrediting body within 60 days of the laboratorys response unless there is an unresolved issue.

 II. Deliverables

<DESC>Intelligence analysts must gather and analyze information from a wide variety of data sets that include: general references, news, technical journals and reports, geospatial data, entity databases, internal reports and more. The different terminologies, formats, data models, and contexts make it difficult to perform advanced analytic tasks across different data sets.
<p>If there are only a small, fixed number of data sets involved in an intelligence problem, then it may be practical to map all of the data sets to a common data model and to develop specialized analytic tools tailored to the problem. However, if the problem changes over time, the data sets are large or numerous, or there are new data sets that need to be integrated with those already in use, then a new approach is required. The focus of the KDD program is to develop novel approaches that will enable the intelligence analyst to effectively derive actionable intelligence from multiple, large, disparate sources of information, to include newly available data sets previously unknown to the analyst.</p>
<p>The ability to quickly produce actionable intelligence from unanticipated, multiple, varied data sets require research advances in two key areas: (1) alignment of data models; and (2) advanced analytic algorithms. Making advances in these two research areas, and fully characterizing the performance of the research results using real Intelligence problems, is the focus of the IARPA Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination (KDD) Program.<br />Performers shall perform research in both areas and develop prototype systems that implement their techniques and research results. The KDD Program will provide data sets to support research and development in addition to extensive test and evaluation.</p>
<p>KDD test and evaluation will take place on an annual cycle, with each performer applying their prototype systems to challenge problems defined by the KDD Program. KDD evaluation of prototype systems will take place at government facilities and will use realistic Intelligence problems and real Intelligence data. The research supported by KDD will generally be unclassified, but the annual KDD evaluations will involve data sets classified no higher than SECRET//NOFORN.</p>
<p>The KDD Program requires a combination of innovative research and the capability to develop robust prototypes. Research goals should be set, and research plans should be made, to take full advantage of the length of the KDD Program. The KDD Program expects a staged approach to prototype development; each successive prototype will leverage research progress made since the previous prototype. IARPA encourages teaming between academic and commercial entities to leverage the strengths of both types of organization. KDD requires the prime contractor for each performer team to have personnel and a facility cleared at the SECRET//NOFORN level at the time their proposal is submitted.</p>
<p>KDD is planned as a 51-month program and anticipates making multiple awards.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(3) For long-term contracts- <br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br />(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. ***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38. ***  

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 326150 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase Flexible Polyurethane Foam. ***

Background:

NIST has the need of Flexible Polyurethane Foam for evaluating whether flexible polyurethane foam can be produced as a reference material. To determine whether such a reference material is feasible, polyurethane foam formulations with well controlled properties are needed for a combustion study.
***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity Ten (10) Flexible Polyurethane Foam Formulations as defined in Requirement 1.

 OPTION LINE ITEMS:  The following items are option line items.  The Contractor shall provide pricing for these items.  Prices quoted shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of award.   Award of option line items is at the sole discretion of the Government in accordance with 52.217-7. 

OPTION LINE ITEM 0002: Quantity Ten (10) Flexible Polyurethane Foam Formulations as defined in Requirement 2.

OPTION LINE ITEM 0003: Quantity Four (4) Flexible Polyurethane Foam Formulations as defined in Requirement 3.

The Flexible Polyurethane Foam for Line Item 0001, and if exercised, Line items 0002 and 0003, shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:
Requirement I (Line Item 0001)
Ten formulations of flexible polyurethane foam are to be produced in the amount needed for tests with method A, B and C as described in Table 1. First, one formulation is to be prepared from a conventional polyether polyol that fulfills the specification given in Table 2. Then, eight further foam batches are to be prepared by systematic variation of the type of the polyether polyol and the type of surfactant used in the formulation as shown in Table 3. such that all possible combinations are prepared. One further formulation is to be prepared by substituting 25 wt.% of the conventional polyol of the initial formulation with a polyol from a renewable resource. All other formulation and processing parameters are to be held constant. Density and air permeability are to be determined by the manufacturer for a minimum of two foam pours per formulation on samples taken from identical positions near the center of the foam bun. The air flow value specified in Table 2 should be met as closely as practically possible for all foams with variations and shall not be lower than 3 ft3 min-1, with the exception of the material containing a renewable resource polyol. The ILD is to be determined by the manufacturer from at least a single foam pour per formulation on samples taken from identical positions near the center of the foam bun. It is acknowledged that the ILD target defined in Table 2 might not be met by the foam produced with variations to the formulation as defined below. Once testing of the foams with method A at NIST is completed, the NIST technical point of contact will select one of the ten formulations to be the target formulation in requirement II (Option Line item 0002).

#	Variation
1	polyether polyol:
- conventional polyol 1 (approximately 7 % ethylene oxide content)
- conventional polyol 2 (approximately 12 % ethylene oxide content)
- conventional polyol 3, with added grafted polyol.
2	Surfactant:
- conventional grade
- flame retardant grade
- universal grade

Requirement II (Option Line Item 0002)
After selecting the target formulation (as defined under Line Item 0001), a new batch of the target formulation and nine foam batches with controlled variations to the target formulation are to be provided in the amount needed for tests with method A, B and C. It is acknowledged that the ILD and the air flow target defined in Table 2 might not be met by the foam produced with variations to the formulation as defined below, since a controlled variation of these properties is aimed for. The requirements for the batches with controlled variations are the following:
First, the amount of the tin catalyst, the amount of water and the mixing head pressure are to be varied systematically in a 23 design with the levels given in Table 4. All other formulation and processing parameters are to be held constant at the levels used in the target formulation. 


Table 4: Process parameters of the target formulation to be varied (Please see attached in word document for correct formulations).
#	Variation	
3	Amount of tin catalyst:
- up to 25 % decrease of the amount used in the formulation
- up to 25 % increase of the amount used in the formulation
(The amount of tin catalyst shall be changed to such a degree that a substantial difference in foam permeability is reached, but the overall foam quality is maintained).	
4	Amount of Water:
- such that the free rise density is 1.5 lb ft-3
- such that the free rise density is 2.1 lb ft-3	

5	Mixing head pressure:
- lower
- higher	

		
Second, a single foam batch shall be produced with the target formulation, except that the amount of water is to be adjusted such that a free rise density of 2.1 lb ft-3 is reached. During processing of the foam, the density is to be adjusted
to 1.8 lb ft-3 using a vacuum process. 
 

Density and air permeability are to be determined by the manufacturer for a minimum of two foam pours per formulation on samples taken from identical positions near the center of the foam bun. The ILD is to be determined by the manufacturer from at least a single foam pour per formulation on samples taken from identical positions near the center of the foam bun. 


Requirement III (Option Line Item 0003)
From the test results obtained with method A, B and C on the 10 foams delivered according to Line Item 0002, the NIST COTR will select four formulations for production in a sufficient amount to perform tests A, D, and E. The selected formulations may vary from the exact specifications given in 
Table 3 and Table 4, although not in a way such that other production equipment or different raw materials are required; e.g. the required density may be 2.0 lb ft 3 instead of the 2.2 lb ft-3 as specified in Table 4. Density and air permeability are to be determined by the manufacturer for a minimum of two foam pours per formulation on samples taken from identical positions near the center of the foam bun. The ILD is to be determined by the manufacturer from at least a single foam pour per formulation on samples taken from identical positions near the center of the foam bun.
Other considerations that apply to Line Item 0001 and if exercised option Line Items 0002 and 0003:
All samples are to be produced on equipment that is dedicated to this project for the period required to consecutively produce the formulations of each requirement. The equipment can be used for other purposes after accomplishment of one requirement until preparation for the next requirement begins. The equipment needs to be clean and flushed appropriately before use in order to prevent any cross-contamination with previous foam formulations processed on the machine. The manufacturer shall provide recent run data from the foam production equipment to NIST that demonstrates that the manufacturer can repeatedly produce foams with specific chemical composition (formulation) of a quality similar to the specifications set in Table 2. All samples are to be post-cured with process parameters recommended by the manufacturer. Details of the formulations to be produced are to be provided to the NIST COTR before sample preparation starts. NIST reserves the right to require changes to the formulations defined above during the course of the project, depending on the outcome of the experimental results. These changes shall not modify the total number of formulations and total number of samples to be prepared.

Sample handling and packaging
All samples are to be provided to NIST with a disclosure of the raw materials used, the date of preparation, any relevant run data, and the ambient temperature and relative humidity in the laboratory on the day of production. All samples are to be cut as specified in Figure 1 to Figure 7. The samples are to be packed in the same orientation as cut from the foam bun, such that the position of the samples in the foam bun can be identified. It should be clearly marked which samples were at the top and bottom side of the foam bun prior to cutting. The samples are to be packed in polyethylene bags and to be put inside cardboard boxes that protect the samples from light exposure.

Cutting of samples for test method A, B, C as in requirements I and II Line Item 0001, and Option Line Item 0002:
All samples are to be cut according to the schematics in Figure 1 to Figure 3 or in an equivalent manner that yields at least the amount of test specimens specified in Table 5. Any alternative cutting scheme must be approved by the NIST COTR. Two additional foam buns of the same size as the foam buns used to prepare samples for tests A (Figure 1) shall be prepared to cut samples from the center of the foam for the determination of ILD, air flow and density bun with the same orientation as the samples in Figure 1 to Figure 3.

Table 5: Minimal, total amount of specimens required. The number of specimens shall be evenly distributed amongst the formulations requested in each requirement. For instance, the 50 specimens requested in requirement I (Line Item 0001) for test method A shall consist of 5 specimens for each for the ten formulations.

The tents must accommodate the tables, chairs to seat 300 people.  <BR><BR>Q.2 How many hours per day will the generator run?<BR>A.2 The generator will run from 0600 to 1700 everyday.<BR><BR>Q.3 How many hours per day do you expect to use the heaters and generator?<BR>A.3 The heaters will be used everyday to keep the tent at 60 degrees.  Therefore, the number of hours depends on the outside temperature.<BR><BR>Q.4 Can we start Set-Up first thing in the morning on January 4th?<BR>A.4 Yes, the contractor may begin setup as early as necessary to have setup complete by 1:00 pm on 4 January 2010. <BR><BR>Q.5 Can we wait to take down the tent until the morning of February 6th when it is light out?  <BR>A.5 Yes, the contractor may take down the tent on the morning of February 6, 2010.<BR><BR>Q.6 Can we stake the tent in the ground?<BR>A.6 Yes, the tent can be staked in the ground.<BR><BR>Q.7 The request for quote states that the tent must be waterproof.  There is no such thing as a waterproof tent that large.  They are all water resistant but there could be a few drops of water here and there depending on what direction the wind is blowing.  Would a water resistant tent be acceptable?<BR>A.7 This type of configuration is acceptable. <BR><BR>Q.8 If tent heaters attached to 100lb propane tanks are proposed to run the tent heaters constantly for approximately 16 hours, will you have the capability to fill the propane tanks when they run out?  <BR>A.8 As specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, the heaters shall be powered by the diesel operated generator or diesel fuel. The government does not have the capability to refill propane. <BR><BR>Q.9 In the request for quote it says Heater shall be attached to the tent through heater holes or other type of duct system.  Heater tubes shall not run under the walls of the tent.  There are only two ways to connect the tent heaters. One is through a diffuser that tucks under the side walls of the tent. The other way is to put the heater directly inside the tent.  Is this acceptable?   <BR>A.9 The Government would prefer electrical heaters powered by the generator if possible.  The heater may go inside the tent if no other alternative is available.<BR><BR>Q.10 An 80KW generator is requested which is certainly very adequate for the heat and lighting required.  It would be useful to know if there will be other services plugged into the generator to ensure the proper unit is specified.<BR>A.10 The generator will only be used for the lights and possibly the heater(s).  Amendment will reflect generator specification changes.<BR><BR>Q.11 Is propane an acceptable form of tent heating? <BR>A.11 As specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, the heaters shall be powered by the generator or diesel fuel.  <BR><BR>Q.12 Does this tent need to be connected to any building or will it be located in a space by itself?<BR>A.12 The tent will be located in a space by itself.<BR><BR>Q.13 Are there any limitations to the dimensions of the tent? We are considering a 40 x 100 tent. The total footprint would be 52 x 112 including all the tent anchors.<BR>A.13 The tent must be able to hold 300 people plus the tables and chairs.  There are no other space limitations.<BR><BR>Q.14 What ground surface will the tent be installed on?<BR>A.14 The tent will be installed on dirt.<BR><BR>Q.15 Is any type of flooring required inside the tent? We would recommend some type of flooring and carpet inside the tent.<BR>A.15 No type of flooring inside the tent is required.<BR><BR>Q.16 When do you expect this contract to be awarded? Several days will be needed for preparation, delivery and installation.<BR>A.16 The Government anticipates award on or about 29 December 2009.<BR><BR>Q.17 I understand that you need to be able to seat 300 people at tables inside the tent with no additional space required. Is this correct?<BR>A.17 Yes.<BR><BR>Q.18 Will partial bids will be considered, or is this opportunity all or nothing?<BR>A.18 This requirement is for a configuration of tent, lights, heater, and chairs to include setup and take down.  One contract will be awarded to provide all items and services.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities. The COTR will serve as the liaison between NLM and the creative team or any other third parties, when communication and contact are necessary. Access to the Contractor is, within reason, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile phone and e-mail device.<br /><br />Vendor will manage multiple phases and tasks, controlling and monitoring workflow while maintaining a high level of service. The Vendor will use efficient technology and delivery services to coordinate information and materials to all project personnel, tracking items electronically and documenting them in spreadsheets, to identify critical relationships, deliverables and dates.<br /><br />At the outset of each project, the Contractor will meet with NLM to establish processes, scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, critical paths and dependencies, schedules and budgets. As projects progress, the Contractor will issue progress reports indicating the status of work accomplished, work in progress, deliverables pending, schedules, budgets and interdependencies. During those briefings and as the project requires, the Contractor will inform NLM of any modifications to the project requirements and mediate any unforeseen issues. Foremost, the Contractor will act on behalf of NLM to ensure that the project is successful and is completed on time and on budget.<br /><br />To manage budgets, the Contractor will keep track of each line item's estimates for each task costs and in a master contract spreadsheet. This enables NLM to see how the budgets are portioned and realign funds as needed. Project estimates with further project cost detail are provided as tasks are required.<br /><br />For each task, estimates and a creative brief with a project plan is submitted to the client. Before works commences we obtain the approval of the COTR to the estimate and creative brief. As the project progresses, Contractor will seek notices to proceed from the COTR with each deliverable and milestone.<br /><br />Deliverables<br /><br />Contractor will design and produce a number of promotional materials, including, but not limited to: (1) designing and/or updating promotional materials, as listed above; and (2) designing and/or updating Web sites. The Government will have exclusive ownership of all deliverables produced under the resultant purchase order.<br /><br />&#9679; POSTER: Please provide an overall, typical cost for designing a 4-color 20 by 30-inch poster, excluding costs associated with printing.

<p>a. Neil Lamartin is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: 439 West York Street, Norfolk, VA&nbsp; 23510.<br />b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.<br />(2) The COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the Contract price, terms or conditions. Any Contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COTR. No such changes shall be made without the expressed prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO may designate assistant or alternate COTR(s) to act for the COTR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the Contractor. <br />(End of clause)<br /><br />NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)<br /><br />The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:<br /><br />A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be reduced the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)<br /><br />Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):<br /><br />Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.<br /><br />The invoice must include:<br /><br />a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br /><br />Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.<br /><br />The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.<br /><br />All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.<br /><br />All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.<br /><br />Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.<br /><br />Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.<br /><br />Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:<br /><br />Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov<br /><br />The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-XX-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award)."<br /><br />NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)</p>
<p>The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br /><br />a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B.</p>
<p>b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:<br /><br />1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.</p>
<p>2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.<br /><br />3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.<br /><br />c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0003). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.<br /><br />d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.</p>
<p>e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.<br /><br />FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (SEP 2009) applies, and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition:<br /><br />(8) 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003) (15 U.S.C. 644).<br />(18) 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009) (15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)).<br />(19) 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003) (E.O. 11755).<br />(20) 52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (Aug 2009) (E.O. 13126).<br />(21) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999).<br />(22) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (Mar 2007) (E.O. 11246).<br />(31) 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies (Feb 2009) (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d).<br />(34) 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (June 2008) (E.O.'s, proclamations, and statutes administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury).<br />(39) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3332).</p>

Description
This is a solicitation for potential offerors interetested in privatizing the natural gas distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  
The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point where the distribution system enters the Installation, and Government ownership starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are the 107th Air Refueling Wing natural gas mains and laterals. Approximately 7,360 linear feet of polyethylene pipe supply natural gas to 16 buildings on the 107th ARW. These lines are owned by National Fuels Gas.  
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate natural gas distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. National Fuel Gas Company supplies natural gas to both systems. Within the boundary of 107th ARW, the gas distribution mains and laterals are owned by National Fuels Gas so they are not included in this offering. The natural gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base contains polyethylene pipe and iron pipe. The pipe sizes vary from 1 inch to 6 inches in diameter. 
Gas enters the 914th natural gas distribution system at the main entrance on Lockport Road. It is delivered through a pressure regulator that drops the pressure to about 5 psi for distribution through the 914th AW owned system. Roughly 3/4 of the gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base was replaced with new polyethylene pipe before 1999. Roughly 40 percent of the laterals were replaced; the remaining laterals are about the same age as the buildings they feed. A project to replace the remaining iron part of the gas main (installed in the 1950's and has reached the end of its useful life) is planned but not funded at this time. Gas is measured at the bulk meter near the regulator at the entrance to the site.
Inventories will be included in the RFP.
The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

Description
This is a solicitation notice to potential offerors to privatize the wastewater distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, treatment plants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the wastewater collection system privatization are the oil/water separators, and grease traps.
	The wastewater collection system serves both the 914th AW and the 107th ARW. The wastewater collection system on the base contains both gravity and pressure flow sewer mains. Most of the collection system on the 914th ARW side of the base is PVC. In the early 1990s, a section of PVC pipe was installed as force main on the 914th side of the base. The wastewater collection system on the 107th side of the base consists of PVC pipe that was installed in 1996. Laterals connecting the buildings to the collection mains are typically cast iron and were installed with the buildings during the 1950s.
	Wastewater collection pipe diameter ranges from 3 to 12 inches. There are two wastewater collection pump stations on the Niagara Falls ARS and about 101 access manholes. Wastewater from the base is discharged through pump station 731 into a PVC force main to a manhole on collection main beneath Walmore Road east of the base. The receiving manhole belongs to Niagara County Sewer District No. 1. The wastewater for the entire base is metered at the Pump Station, Facility 731.
Wastewater discharge volumes are measured at the discharge pump station in building 731 on the Niagara Falls ARS wastewater system. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 reported the wastewater discharge to be 40 million gallons in 1994. In 1998, the base owned flow meter records show that 37 million gallons were discharged from the base. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 invoices the base for wastewater based on the meter in the pump station.
In calendar year 1998, the average monthly discharge was 3 million gallons per month. Peak discharge occurred in March 1998 at 6.7 million gallons, and the minimum monthly discharge was 1.4 million gallons in November. A net decrease in the square footage of buildings on the base is expected within the next 5 years as planned demolitions are completed. As a result, future wastewater system demand should decrease.
The 914th AW was issued an industrial waste permit with the Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 that expired June 1, 2000. Renewal of this permit was applied for by the 914th CEV.  Future permit renewals will be applied for by the 914th CEV.
	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.

<DESC><p>*** FA8509-09-R-23400-0001 , dated 30 Oct 2009 ***<br /><br />Based on proposals received under RFP FA8509-R-23400, Lightweight Paratroop Doors, the Government has concluded ambiguities contained within the Performance-Based Work Statement, the lack of critical evaluation information under Sections L and M, and the best estimate quantities (BEQs) requested in the CLIN structure under Section B, may have created an environment not conducive to adequate competition based on a huge disparity between all offerors. Therefore, while the scope of the requirement for the Lightweight Paratroop Doors is not changed, the Government is amending RFP FA8509-09-R-23400 in an attempt to provide a more clear, concise Performance Based Work Statement and evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Amendment 0001 cover page, dated and signed, is required to be returned simultaneously with all revised pricing and technical volumes/proposals no later than 4:30 pm EST, 16 November 2009. Digital proposals are required and should be sent via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:wendi.lough@robins.af.mil">wendi.lough@robins.af.mil</a> with a cc to Beckie.King@robins.af.mil. Hard copies will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The following changes have been incorporated in to the RFP as follows:<br /><br />Section B - CLIN structure has been updated to include references to specific PWS paragraphs in an attempt to provide clarity; firm quantities provided for Group A and B kits.</p>
<p>Section I - Transportation and Packaging information has been updated to included the use of a MORD instead of a TAC.</p>
<p>Section J - PWS revised to add specific information and required details for spring requirement.</p>
<p>Sections L and M - Revised Technical Evaluation Factors</p>

<DESC>This Special Notice identifies GSA&rsquo;s outline of requirements for NIST FIPS 199 defined Low and Moderate Impact Cloud Computing (CC) Software as a Service (SaaS) offering. <br /><br />Cloud Computing is a major initiative to modernize Information Technology (IT) within the Government. Cloud computing has the capability to reduce the cost of IT infrastructure using commercially available technology that is based on virtualization of servers, databases and applications to allow for capital cost savings. <br /><br />In anticipation of a possible issuance of an RFQ referring to Cloud Computing Software as a Service (SaaS), the following information is provided: <br /><br />In CC, security responsibilities are shared between the Contractor and the Consumer, in this case a Federal Government Agency. The Contractor will be responsible for provisioning, securing, monitoring, and maintaining the hardware, network(s), and software that support the infrastructure that is offered. In addition, the Contractor will be responsible for the security of the Operating System (OS) and any additional software (i.e., any data base management systems), including the applications provided. If individual (named) user access is required, the specific Service Level Agreement shall document who is responsible for creating and maintaining user accounts. The Service Level Agreements shall also document how the user accounts will be created and maintained. <br /><br />The implementation of a new Federal Government IT system requires a formal approval process known as Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A). NIST Special Publication 800-37, Revision 1, gives guidelines for performing the C&amp;A process. <br /><br />At the Low and Moderate Impact levels, the Contractor must prepare and provide required documentation that describes the security mechanisms and processes used to maintain a secure environment. The contractor must also provide evidence of an independent assessment of these mechanisms, processes, and documents.&nbsp; Interested contractors should begin to prepare and accumulate relevant security artifacts as defined in NIST 800 series publications. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, IS NOT PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS THE GSA OBLIGATED TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.&nbsp; <br /><br />For more information, interested parties should E-mail <a href="mailto:saas.rfi@gsa.gov">saas.rfi@gsa.gov</a>.

<DESC>RFI for LIMS and Business Systems/Processes Assessment &amp; Recommendation
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>This Request For Information (RFI) is for INFORMATIONAL AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and SHALL NOT BE construed as A SOLICITATION or as an OBLIGATION on the part of SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F). THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. Any questions concerning this solicitation must be directed through the SAIC-F point of contact, at the email address listed below.</p>
<p>RFI Number: S10-092</p>
<p>Posted Date: December 7, 2009</p>
<p>MODIFIED - Response Due Date: December 23, 2009 by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time</p>
<p>Contracting office address: SAIC-Frederick, Inc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 92 Thomas Johnson Drive, Suite 250<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frederick, MD 21702-1201</p>
<p>Purpose of RFI:</p>
<p>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) has a requirement to assess existing laboratory operational processes and related IT infrastructure within the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) as well as implement a plan to address deficiencies and additional technology requirements and/or enhancements in an effort to improve overall operations. The goal of the initiative is to leverage industry best practices that will provide improved productivity, enhanced reporting capability, a more seamless service experience to ATP's customers as well as reduce ATP's total cost of services through gains in efficiency.</p>
<p>Organizational Overview:</p>
<p>The ATP partners with the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-F) to provide highly specialized, cutting-edge expertise and support through a tightly integrated, highly effective approach to the study of complex biological problems using a broad spectrum of advanced technologies. The ATP's wide range of cutting-edge technologies accelerates the translation of basic research discoveries into new treatments for patients with cancer and AIDS.</p>
<p>The ATP is comprised of a total of nine laboratories - six core service laboratories and three dedicated laboratories. Historically, each of the laboratories has operated independently in terms of making process improvements, which has resulted in disparate technology implementations making ongoing support and project/financial reporting difficult and costly.</p>
<p><br />Work Scope &amp; Deliverables:</p>
<p>&#61607; Assess existing laboratory and business work flow processes and systems for nine (9) ATP laboratories to identify deficiencies and additional requirements with a focus on the following current key work flow elements that are integral to ATP's operations: 1) customer request; 2) cost estimate and work scope; 3) multilevel project/cost approvals; 4) LIMS [project, sample, and data management]; 5) billing; 6) customer satisfaction feedback; 7) reporting capability; 8) time reporting; 9) PR generation; 10) M&amp;S expense tracking; and 11) supplies inventory management.</p>
<p>The six (6) core service laboratories have an estimated total of 45 work flows; and the three (3) dedicated laboratories have an estimated total of 24 work flows.<br />&#61607; Capture the following information for the systems already in place as part of the data collection effort for documentation of an ATP systems inventory to be prepared by the ATP: 1) laboratory name; 2) system name; 3) administrative point of contact; 4) technical point of contact; 5) functional use of system; and 6) deficiencies.<br />&#61607; Provide a final report that documents the following:<br />a) Feedback acquired from the data collection process for each ATP laboratory. The reports are to be provided in standard use case format for use in future technical development efforts.<br />b) A gap analysis of existing laboratory operational processes against industry best practices for each ATP laboratory as well as an overall summary of the findings.<br />c) Several alternative solutions that will offer options based on required levels of investment for improving operational efficiencies within each laboratory or ATP-wide, as applicable, along with associated costs; benefits; risks; recommended investments in process reengineering, technology, and training; as well as a return on investment analysis for each solution. The recommended alternative should also be identified.<br />Solution requirements:</p>
<p>1. The recommended LIMS solutions must be caBIG compliant.<br />2. Qualification of the ATP laboratories for electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) suitability should be considered.<br />3. SmartStream (SAIC-F's financial system) has the following requirements that need to be considered as part of the solutions:<br />&#61607; The following fields must integrate with SmartStream: 1) center number; 2) item code; 3) CSAS field; 4) project field; 5) quantity; 6) requestor; 7) unit price; 8) PI information; and 9) AO information.<br />&#61607; An output billing file is required for SmartStream.<br />4. Include recommendations regarding priorities for a staged implementation plan. This will include information about connectivity to existing legacy systems currently under reevaluation (CSAS, Yellow Task).<br />Responder Instructions:</p>
<p>Responder must submit a capability statement (10 page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their organization's experience and abilities to provide an assessment and recommendation as described, which includes:</p>
<p>1) the professional qualifications and experience of key staff who may be assigned to perform the assessment and recommendation; <br />2) listing of any/all current and relevant certifications from a qualified neutral third-party and contact information;<br />3) experience in performing laboratory process and technology assessments and strategy recommendations from both a scientific and business operations perspective;<br />4) experience in integrating laboratory and business systems;<br />5) knowledge and experience with LIMS implementations for major companies with similar data and sample processing requirements;<br />6) an estimated itemized cost based on defined work scope and deliverables to include the following breakdowns:<br />d) Provide two separate estimates: 1) estimate for core service laboratories (total of 6 labs) and 2) estimate for dedicated laboratories (total of 3 labs).<br />e) Estimated itemized pricing for the core service laboratories and dedicated laboratories as requested in #6a into estimates for performing a 1) LIMS assessment and recommendation and 2) business systems/process assessment and recommendation.<br />The above cost estimates we understand will be best guess estimates based on the information provided herein and will be used for budgetary planning only.<br />The initial response should include the following Business Information in addition to the capability statement:</p>
<p>1) RFI Number<br />2) DUNS number<br />3) Company Name<br />4) Company Address<br />5) Company Point of Contacts, Phone, FAX, and Email Address.

<DESC>This amendment is to include additional questions and answers for this solicitation.
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
1) Task 3.2 is the museum Director's meeting, which would seem like it should occur shortly after the partnership meetings in Task 3.1. However, it is shown as occurring in May 2010 in the schedule. Should this meeting be in March, or is it intended to be more of a wrap up meeting? 
(A).  This meeting is scheduled to coincide with the American Association of Museums annual meeting where national directors would likely be in attendance. 
2) Does the Price Proposal need to provide a firm fixed price for project expenses?  If so, can you provide more detail about the 10 onsite partnership meetings described in Task 3.1 so that we can budget for them?   
(A).  This is firm fixed price.  These meetings are anticipated to take place with meeting directors in various regions throughout the country.

<p>This participant-directed education/advice would principally support the tax decision, but might also include a component of general financial/retirement counseling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tools used might include a spectrum of options including, but not limited to written collateral, web-based tools, telephonic customer service support and individual counseling.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars and is awarded under Contract No. HHSN261200800001E with SAIC-Frederick, Inc., the Operations and Technical Support contract for NCI-Frederick. The Contractor's DUNS number is 159990456.
<p>The purpose of this action is to fund the following ARRA projects:</p>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a large-scale, collaborative effort to characterize the genomic changes that occur in cancer. Biospecimen Core Resources - NCH</p>
<p>New Therapeutic Molecules - The goal of this program is to ensure the supply of drugs required by NCI-supported clinical trials and evaluation of new drugs for clinical study.</p>
<p>CBC Functional Biology Working Space - NCI's Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) is a network of scientists from government, industry, and academia who are identifying multiple, new targets for early-stage drug development.</p>
<p>Universal Influenza Vaccine Development - NIAID's Vaccine Research Center is developing universal flu vaccines that will provide coverage against multiple strains.</p>
<p>Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Award: This award is priced as an "Other Than Fixed Price" action. Work assigned to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is pursuant to the terms and conditions of Contract No. HHSN261200800001E, a cost-plus-award-fee prime contract for operations and technical support to the NCI-Frederick. The use of a separate fixed price award to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is not appropriate because this is Research and Development work issued under an existing cost reimbursement contract.</p>
<p>Justification for Noncompetitive Award: This ARRA funded award is being made as a within scope modification to an existing contract awarded noncompetitively to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. pursuant to a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition signed by the DHHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy on January 17, 2007.</p>

There are no other firms that can meet the prices provided by AIHA. The period of performance will be for one Basic Year and two Option years. Interested sources that have the capability to perform the services may contact me via email at rieko.toma.jp@kadena.af.mil. Responses must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. Japan Standard Time on December 31, 2009. The Government will consider all responses but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely under the discretion of the Government. This action is under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
