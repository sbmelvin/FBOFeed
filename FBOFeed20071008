<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT

The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for IFB 930 - Building 6 Seismic Upgrade Project, Phase 2, 3 and 4, Construction services.  

Building 6 is a one-story steel framed building built in approximately 1941.   It is circular in plan with a diameter of 161ft. -4 in. and a height at the perimeter of 44 feet.  The dome rises to a height of 81 feet at the center of the building.  It is separated from the surrounding annex building by a 7-1/2 inch joint.  The structural system of Building 6 is a steel braced frame.  The roof is supported by a system of arched steel roof trusses, which are supported by 24 steel columns at the perimeter of the building.  A 30 ton radial bridge crane is supported by a center pivot and another 24 steel crane columns.

The Building 6 lateral system is diagonal steel bracing located around the perimeter of the building.  The original structure has been modified with some original braces removed and some replaced by 4ft x 3-1/2 in. double angles connected to gussets with high-strength bolts.

Considerations in the selection of the seismic upgrade approach were the congested nature of Building 6 which appears to preclude the use of heavy lifting equipment to install new structural steel.  The presence of sensitive laboratory equipment and the desire to minimize concrete demolition or welding are also primary considerations.  

The proposed seismic upgrade project includes the replacement of existing steel braces, new connections, and modifications to the radial crane central support.  These are described below:

All of the existing double angle lower tier braces will be replaced with new double channel braces.  Then layout will generally match existing layout except that the work-point at the base will be approximately at he top of existing floor slab.  In some cases, the work point will be slightly higher to permit the braces to avoid existing equipment.  

New connections will be provided at the ends of the replaced braces.  These will have larger gussets sized to meet the required demands.  The connection of the double channels to the gusset plates will be one of three methods: high-strength bolting with shop drilled holes, high-strength bolting with field drilled holes, or welding.  It is anticipated one end of the double angle braces will be connected with high-strength bolting with shop drilled holes and the other with either high-strength bolting with field drilled holes to provide installation tolerance.  Welding will be limited to the braced to column connections on the ground level only. 

At the upper tier of bracing, some existing connections will be replaced similar to the approach described above.

The restraint of the crane bridge beam central support will be modified to provide additional lateral stiffness.  This is anticipated to be accomplished by adding new stiffer lateral springs.

The relocation, temporary work and modification of plumbing and fire protection systems will be provided where systems are affected by or would impede the structural modification work.  Similar electrical relocation and modification work will be Owner-performed.

The total construction cost for the phase 2, 3 and 4 work is estimated to be between $3 million and $6 million dollars.  The project will occur during three four-six week shut-down periods:  Phase I has already been completed - April, 2007; Phase 2 beginning on or about April 1, 2008; Phase 3 commencing on or about April 1, 2009 and Phase 4 commencing on or about April 1, 2010.  Around-the-clock work will be permitted during part of the performance time.  Other contractors and client labor forces will be performing work during the same timeframe.  The contractor will be required to share access, use of cranes, etc. during these shut-down periods. 

Three lay-down areas will be provided to the contractor for storage of materials required for construction:  a remote one in the Building 51 parking area, one small area adjacent to Building 6, and one designated location within the perimeter of the work area.  But for a few spaces, the contractor crew will need to park in the Building 51 parking area and carpool to the Building 6 site.

Firms interested in being pre-qualified to perform this work should send a REQUEST TO RECEIVE THE PREQUALIFICATION PACKAGE, including their company name, address, phone number, fax, contact person and business size (small, large, woman owned, disadvantaged, Veteran owned, hub zone, etc.), by e-mail to: RLHoffman@LBL.gov .  A prequalification package will be sent to interested firms approx. 10/25/07 and will be due back, completed, by November 12, 2007.  A site visit will be made available to interested prequalified parties mid December. After review of the submitted packages, all firms that are evaluated as being prequalified will then be sent an invitation for bid (IFB) package and information about the site visit.  Firms that were previously prequalified to bid on the Phase 1 scope do not need to resubmit prequalification packages.

Direct any questions concerning this announcement to Rose Hoffman e-mail RLHoffman@lbl.gov.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Armor Encapsulation
<DESC>Idaho National Laboratory, managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize the technology. The INL would like to identify a partner to enter into an exclusive license agreement to manufacture INL?s method of producing an armor encapsulation system.  The INL seeks parties interested in manufacturing armor encapsulation.  

Technology: The INL has demonstrated a method for producing a coated armor system and process.  An armor system and method involves providing a core material and a stream of atomized coating material that comprises a liquid fraction and a solid fraction.
