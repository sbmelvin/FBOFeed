<DESC>Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) intends to issue an Invitation for International Proposals (IFIP) for the provision of the NATO System for Tracking Entitlements and Privileges (NSTEP) for Human Resources Data Services (HRDS). Please note: The system name is notional and may change before the IFIP is issued.
<p>SHAPE requires a system to manage Allied Command Operations (ACO) staff use of their NATO entitlements - rationed items and tax-free sales. Effectively, this will be a virtual ration card system linked with NATO's incoming ACO/ACT and Missions Identification System (AMIS) card and NATO's Automated Personnel Management System (APMS) - ACO's human resources database system.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor's personnel who will provide the required services must be in possession of a current NATO national security check. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to SHAPE the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>In order to bid on this project, a U.S. prime contractor must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government, and 4) have successfully performed at least three contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope and magnitude to the requirement described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFIP is IFIP-ACO-SH-14-01.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate potential prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms should request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application): 14 January 2014</p>
<p>IFIP release (planned): January 2014</p>
<p>Please note: Budget Committee rules allow for nominations to the bidders list past the IFIP release date and up until bid closing. The IFIP will be posted here:</p>
<p>http://www.aco.nato.int/page136374522.aspx</p>
<p>Bid closing (planned): March 2014</p>

<DESC><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Surgical Scrub Brushes through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 01 April 2014. This is not a request for quote or proposal.</strong>
<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Surgical Scrub Brushes which are impregnated with an antimicrobial ingredient and has a nail cleaner. The Surgical Scrub Brushes are easy to open with wet or dry hands. The Surgical Scrub Brushes have soft flexible bristles, and a soft sponge. The Surgical Scrub Brushes are latex free or latex safe. The Surgical Scrub Brushes are made for single use, and has a defined shelf life.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Surgical Scrub Brushes will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, william.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124. Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the FBO website.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform all interested parties of the FAA's decision to contract via single-source procedures.   

The FAA intends to award a contract to Schneider Electric of Palatine, IL. This contract will run for 18 months with one six month option. This contract will commence on or about February 15, 2014 and have a ceiling of $9,600,000.

The FAA has a continuing need for standardized Electrical Distribution Equipment (EDE), for renovation of existing Air Traffic Control sites and the construction of new ones.  Additionally, the EDE supplier must fully support the FAAs Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) system and provide technical training.  These supplies and services were provided by the Schneider Corporation (formerly Square D) under Contract # DTFAAC-04-D-00130, which expired on September 30, 2013. Presently, Schneider Electric is the only contractor equipped to provide these supplies and services. This contract will serve as a bridge to satisfy the FAAs immediate needs until a contractor can be selected for a long term contract based upon a full and open competition. A Request for Information (RFI) for the full and open competition will be released in the first quarter of 2014 and an award is anticipated in early 2015.

A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. This announcement is for informational purposes only, and is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or request for a proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement.

Any questions or comments should be referred to the Contracting Officer at Larry.Mendelson@faa.gov, tel. 202-493-4623, prior to January 10, 2013 at 12:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time.

Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.

<a href="mailto:Fuchs.Samantha@epamail.epa.gov">Samantha Fuchs</a>
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Fondriest Environmental, Inc. to purchase the following items: 1.	 Upgrade to the existing YSI 6600V2 Water Quality Monitoring Multiprobe (upgrade to V2-4) which will allow for the use of 4 optical probes including turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, and phycocyanin.  2.	YSI EXO2 water Quality Monitoring Multiprobe including conductivity/temperature, pH/ORP, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and total algae sensors. 3.	Water Quality monitor buoy including costal data buoy, cellular data logger, and mooring hardware.
For the past 7 years, the EPA has been using Yellow Springs Instruments (YSI) equipment for year-round data collection in the East Fork Watershed.  All the water quality sondes currently used by several Divisions and Labs at ORD-Cincinnati use proprietary YSI hardware and software.  While all water quality sondes theoretically yield equivalent data for the multiple water quality measurements they make, a change in hardware manufacturer would raise the question continuity of data from past years into the future in the mind of peer reviewers.  Additionally, other manufacturer?s water quality sondes are not compatible with YSI software.  Using two different software packages for two different manufacturer?s equipment would increase the possibility of errors during data transfer and compilation, and would negatively affect the quality of the data.  
YSI does not directly sell their equipment, but uses regional vendors, with only one vendor in each region.  Fondriest Environmental, Inc., 2091 Exchange Court, Fairborn, OH 45324 is the vendor for the Cincinnati area.
EPA has identified Fondriest Environmental, Inc. as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement.  
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The Receiver Technology Section of the Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) Branch at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is developing a radio frequency (RF) Signal Conditioning and Distribution System (SCDS). The SCDS provides configurable connectivity between sensor assets and signal processor assets. The SCDS accepts outputs of the sensor systems, which can be broadly categorized into five suites of systems: Sensor System A, B, C, D, and E. The SCDS provides inputs to mission system equipment, which can be broadly categorized into 5 suites of equipment: Mission System A, Mission System B, Mission System C, Mission System D and Mission System E.&nbsp; The development relevant to this RFP pertains to three SCDS subsystems: Unit Type 1, Unit Type 2 and Unit Type 3. The work required by this contract shall be performed in accordance with A-level specifications and a statement of work (SOW), which will be available with the solicitation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, test, and deliver units as listed in the SOW to meet the performance criteria specified by the A-level specifications and in accordance with the detailed requirements in the SOW. The contractor shall adhere to these requirements for each of the following three constituent subsystems:<br />&#9679; Unit Type 1: 9x8 RF Switch Matrix<br />&#9679; Unit Type 2: Ganged 2x1 Switches<br />&#9679; Unit Type 3: 96x110 Broadband Switch Matrix</p>
<p>Spares and support services for installation and repair will be required. The land-based testing on a ship-motion simulator (SMS), either at the contractor's site or NRL Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD), will be part of the factory acceptance test. The final systems' check-out onboard the platform will be performed at Norfolk, VA.</p>
<p>The work required by this contract requires accessing information classified at the SECRET level. Contractor personnel shall have a current, valid, and final SECRET clearance granted by the Department of Defense by date of contract award.</p>
<p>A fixed-price indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated.</p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the supplies and services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p>NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest must be received in writing no later than January 29, 2014 at 5:00 PM, and should include the following information at a minimum:</p>
<p>&bull; Building name and address;<br />&bull; Location of space in the building;<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rate per RSF;<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet and rental rate per ABOA, full service inclusive of a Tenant Improvement allowance of $46.74/ABOA SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />&bull; Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space;<br />&bull; The date that the space will be available;<br />&bull; Site plan showing parking area(s) and loading area(s);<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; Evidence of ability to meet the required occupancy date of June, 2014.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers, or agents may offer space for consideration. Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>Projected Dates:</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest Due: January 29, 2014<br />Market Survey (Estimated): February 14, 2014<br />Offers Due (Estimated): March 2014<br />Occupancy (Estimated): On or before December 25, 2014</p>
<p>Authorized Contacts:</p>
<p>GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall the Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning this space requirement with any Federal Agency other than the offices and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative, DTZ. Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>

<DESC>This notice serves to announce the intent of the Marine Corps Systems Command Contracting Office to issue a solicitation for the procurement of Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) and continued software development for the Combined Arms Command and Control Trainer Upgrade System (CACCTUS).<br /><br />CACCTUS is an upgrade to the USMC's CAST (Combined Arms Staff Trainer). Using the system components and capabilities - simulation, 2D and 3D visuals, interfaced C4I, synthetic terrain, and an after action review, the concept of operations for the CACCTUS system is to immerse the trainees in a realistic, scenario-driven environment to enable commanders and their battle staffs to train or rehearse combined arms tactics, techniques and procedures and decision-making processes. The system is currently providing training up to and including the battalion level. The CACCTUS project will ultimately provide interoperability between the CAST trainer and other Marine Corps Air and Ground Training devices. It will provide fire support training for the MAGTF elements up to and including the MEB level. <br />CACCTUS is currently deployed at Camp Lejeune, NC; Camp Pendleton, CA; 29 Palms, CA, Kaneohe Bay, HI and Camp Butler, Okinawa, Japan and is not at Full Operational Capability (FOC). This effort will continue to develop evolutions to the current CACCTUS baseline as required to achieve FOC and continue to maintain the system though PDSS. Deployment of an annual upgrade includes contractor installation at each of the five sites. <br /><br />Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be issued in February 2014.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) for this procurement is 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services.<br />This Requirement is 100% small business set-aside.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation RFP seeks opinions on making the CDRL delivery more efficient; views on what information is needed to clarify the PWS and input to improve the RFP prior to final release. <br /><br />The most recent delivery of the Software&nbsp;Version Description(SVD), System/Sub-System Design Document(SSDD) , Interface Design Description (IDD), Software Design Description(SDD), Software Users Manual(SUM) and Software Install Guide(SUM) will be available for review at RFP release.<br /><br />This notice does not obligate the government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. <br />All questions must be provided to the contracting office at PM TRASYS to Ms. Sandi Brubaker sandi.brubaker@usmc.mil. No telephonic inquiries will be entertained.<br /><br />Industry day(s) information in support of this procurement will be announced a minimum of 2 weeks prior to event.

INL's strategy in Tajikistan aims to reform Tajikistan's law-enforcement and justice-sector institutions so that its criminal justice system is more responsive to the needs of its citizens and communities. INL Dushanbe's justice sector programs aim to strengthen the rule of law and ensure the protection of the legal rights and human rights. A major project implemented by the American Bar Association's Rule of Law Initiative addresses reform of the defense bar and rule of law education. INL also develops rule of law in Tajikistan by conducting legal training for judges, defense attorneys, and law students; improving access to justice; strengthening local bar associations; reforming the existing criminal code; and monitoring court cases to ensure compliance with local and international norms. INL's community policing program supports the goal of promoting criminal justice sector reform. Community policing is aimed to generate an understanding of and support for democratic and community-oriented policing among key leaders in the GOTI Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), and improve trust between the police and the community, by building collaborative police-community partnerships.</p>

<RESPDATE>022814
<CONTACT>Raymond C. Cannon, Phone 3017575921, Email raymond.c.cannon@navy.mil
<DESC>1.0 Introduction:<br />&nbsp;<br />In March 2013, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) released a Sources Sought Notice, solicitation #242-13-060, to identify qualified, experienced and interested potential sources in the current marketplace. The previous solicitation sought market information on businesses capable of providing capabilities for a Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) lab environment. This notice is issued as a follow-on to that previous solicitation. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. All parties may respond to this notice regardless of the degree of participation with the previous solicitation. Responses to this notice are voluntary and will be treated as information only. The Government does not anticipate that a comprehensive response to this Sources Sought Notice will contain CLASSIFIED information. If a CLASSIFIED response is required, contact the Government point of contact for further instruction.. Not responding to this Sources Sought Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFPs, if any are issued. If a solicitation is released, a synopsis will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov).<br /><br />The Government, including representatives from the Navy and Army, intends to host an industry day, as well as, conduct one-on-one follow-up meetings with respondents of this notice. These meetings will allow for detailed information exchange and facilitate the potential initiation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). Additional information about the meetings is included in section 3.0.<br /><br />The NAICS Codes and Product and Service Codes (PSCs) listed in Paragraph 5.0, "Additional Information," may also be applicable to this Sources Sought Notice.
<p>2.0 Background: <br /><br />The Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE<sup>TM</sup>) Consortium is an aviation-focused professional group made up of U.S. industry suppliers, customers, and users. The FACE Consortium provides a vendor-neutral forum for industry and the U.S. government to work together to create software development standards and to gain consensus on a common framework, addressing such areas as open standards, best practices, guidance documents, data acquisition and competition driven business models.<br />The FACE Technical Standard was developed by the FACE Consortium and calls for software-based capabilities to be developed as components that interact with other software components through multiple FACE key interfaces, which will allow for reuse, third party technical insertion and increased component competition. The FACE Technical Standard defines the software reference architecture and interfaces intended for the development of portable components and applications. <br /><br />NAVAIR and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) plan to demonstrate software capabilities in a common operating environment defined by the FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.0. These demonstrations will potentially help influence future architecture development for both the joint DoD services Future Vertical Lift (FVL) and the F/A-XX. This activity includes establishing a prototype FACE common operating environment (COE) in Government laboratories at Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Aircraft Division (AD) in Patuxent River, MD, NAWC Weapons Division (WD) in China Lake, CA, and AMRDEC in Huntsville, AL. To maximize participation in these demonstrations, the Government intends to initiate CRADAs with industry partners. For more information on CRADAs, visit the following site:<br />http://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcad/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.content_detail&amp;key=2D3FA237-B2F7-4BC6-90E2-0955C5502771. <br /><br />To accomplish the goals set out in the previous solicitation, the Government intends to work alongside industry to integrate industry's software capabilities into a Government provided prototype FACE COE. The COE will be aligned to the FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.0. All industry supplied software components anticipated to be integrated must prove adherence to the FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.0 through the use of a Government specified conformance test suite. A list of the laboratory software and hardware available for utilization is included in attachment A. The FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.0 can be downloaded free of charge at https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/c137. <br />Participation will encourage and enhance the collaborative environment between industry and the Government towards developing and integrating FACE conformant products While participating in CRADAs, industry participants will be able to engage directly with Government FACE subject matter experts (SMEs) to better understand the requirements and implementation of the FACE Technical Standard. The CRADAs will give industry the opportunity to demonstrate their unique product capabilities operating in a portable, and reusable open architecture environment to a wide range of Government participants. <br /><br />The PMA209 FACE team will be hosting an industry day on 23 January 2014 in the Patuxent River, MD area. During this industry day, more information will be provided about the software and hardware capabilities the Government intends to utilize in a military flight representative system. Information about the reference architecture diagram, operational, technical and service views will be provided to allow contractors to determine where their capability best meets the FACE lab objectives. System Design Documents (SDDs) and System Architecture Documents (SADs) will be provided for all relevant components in the system architecture. If industry members are not able to participate in the industry day, diagrams, views and documentation will be provided via a secure IT system. In order to participate in this industry day or receive system documentation, please provide the requested information listed in section 3.0.</p>
<p>In addition to the previous Sources Sought Notice, the Government's goals for this specific effort, in priority order, are to: <br />a) Demonstrate industry software capabilities, which have been tested for conformance to the FACE Technical Standard with a Government specified conformance tool suite, in a military flight representative system. The Government is interested in verifying the following capabilities, in priority order:<br />i. Capabilities that are direct alternatives to existing Government capabilities integrated into the provided reference architecture <br />ii. New industry capabilities that are not part of the existing reference architecture<br />iii. Modification to existing industry capabilities that can be integrated into the reference architecture <br />b) Demonstrate industry software capabilities, which have been tested for conformance to the FACE Technical Standard with a Government specified conformance tool suite, which adhere to the FACE Technical Standard on industry provided hardware. <br />i. Demonstrating third party software capabilities running on industry hardware provided by a company other than the third party<br />ii. Demonstrating industry capability running on the owner company's hardware<br />c) Utilize the following support provided by industry:<br />i. Technical support for demonstrations<br />ii. Hardware provider for demonstrations<br />iii. Alternate facilities where demonstrations can be held</p>
<p>Goals a and b represent the areas where the Government is most interested in entering into CRADAs with industry. A CRADA would be established with a company proposing to meet goal c only if the Government did not have access to the resources proposed by the company and if determination was made that the resources would be beneficial to advancing the other goals of this effort.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives </span></p>
<p>As part of GSA's acquisition program restructuring effort, the support of professional services to assist with framing the improved internal controls designed around current workforce and electronic capabilities, inclusive of metrics, are needed. The new internal controls reflect revised and additional roles and responsibilities for more effective acquisition over sight, and standard operating procedures for contract review and audits.</p>
<p>The objective is to have a contractor to implement the restructured and new internal controls processes and metrics through the followings however, not limited to: Providing consultation, working with documents and review of Federal contracts, setting up and performing trend analysis with the review findings, establishment of metrics to monitor trends and internal controls compliance, setting up various templates, and providing recommendations for further review and internal control enhancement. Upon implementation, it is expected that the contractor can transition/train the knowledge to the Acquisition Community.</p>
<p>GSA needs to know the level of contractor's support and capability necessary to outline and provide services with focus on contractor's recommendation on timing as an important element and desired process with the establishment of necessary templates, metrics, reports and other tools for reviews and oversight.</p>
<p>In effort to address current issues for improved results, NCR, PBS, Acquisition Management is revisiting its internal controls and oversight processes to address the following areas with contractors' recommendations on:</p>
<p>&bull;Systemic Trends - To properly address deficiencies, NCR needs visibility of significant recurring issues, so as to correlate findings with training and policy development. <br /><br />&bull;Sample Size - Reviews need to be statistically relevant and focus on the procurements under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), so as to detect and address systemic trends in a regular and recurring fashion. FY 13, NCR, PBS Total number of Acquisition Actions was: 5,319 of which, 4,801 were under and or at the SAT level, in the areas of: Maintenance &amp; Repair, Professional Management Services, House Keeping, A/E, Construction, Training, Utility &amp; Energy, IT, Transportation, Protection - Security, and Other. <br /><br />&bull;Timing - To be effective in shaping procurement outcomes, reviews need to have &lsquo;real time' significance and occur during the pre-award stage. Doing so, will enable the region to make needed course corrections, reduce acquisition risk, and ensure the wise expenditure of taxpayer dollars. <br /><br />&bull;Risk - Anticipation in 100% oversight is not possible. To maximize productivity and ensure what would be the best expenditure of resources. Meaningful reviews, oversight must be directed towards acquisitions with the greatest risk. <br /><br />&bull;Accountability - Acquisition Excellence must be woven into the acquisition culture of the organization. Acquisition outcomes are the responsibility of both the operations and policy function of the organization.</p>

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR SEEKING BUSINESSES The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334519 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 Employees for an upcoming requirement for the USGS, Reston Acquisition Branch for the purchase of Python Snake Tags/GPS for tracking the movement and habitat use of giant constrictors, including the invasive Burmese python in the Florida Everglades. In order to better understand the way these animals interact with the environment, detailed tracking information is required. The use of remote-downloadable GPS tags will allow us to get detailed and frequent location information for these animals. Further, the devices must be implanted under the snakes skin, so size and shape of the tag are critical. Telemetry Solutions is the only vendor that is currently able to adapt a GPS tag with remote download ability to the size and shape we require for use in giant constrictors. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.

<DESC>The National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) provides technical and administrative support on behalf of the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council. The NSET Subcommittee is the coordinating body for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).
<p>The NSET Subcommittee has approved a budget that includes funds for NNCO to subscribe to the LRNI service for FY14. This service will provide access for all NSET Subcommittee members to the series of reports on nanotechnology that LUX Research has prepared over the past several years, and any new reports that they publish over the coming year. These reports are the most frequently cited source of information on nanotechnology investment trends and market opportunities, both within the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The breadth of detailed information available through the LRNI service is not available from any other source. The NSET Subcommittee requires access to the LUX Research information in order to be better able to compare other sources of information to the LUX Research information, and therefore to evaluate the validity of the highly cited LUX Research reports. Purchasing this subscription to the LRNI service will also provide NNCO staff members and NSET Subcommittee members with direct access to LUX Research analysts who prepared these reports, and will therefore enable direct communication concerning the methodologies that LUX has been using to develop its nanotechnology reports, thus allowing for better assessment of the validity of those reports. <br /><br />The period of performance will be the base year of January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2014, with one option year with a period of January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015.<br /><br />Firms that believe they can supply an equivalent product are invited to submit capability statements no later than December 30, 2013, for consideration by the NSF.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command <br> https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=a74de86e6a18269... 12/12/2013 <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 4400 Martin Road <br> Rm: A6SE040.001 <br> Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 <br> Fax: (256) 450-8840 <br>  <br> Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: <br> Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 4400 Martin Road <br> Rm: A6SE040.001 <br> Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 <br> Fax: (256) 450-8840 <br>  <br> The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. <br> If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMCAMC-Level Protest Procedures. <br>  <br> Proposals are due no later than Friday, 10 January 2014 by 4:00PM CST and may only be submitted electronically via email to the following points of contact: Ms. Jacqueline Montague, Contract Specialist, at jacqueline.t.montague.civ@mail.mil AND Ms. Dawn Windham, Contracting Officer, at dawn.m.windham.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br>

<CONTACT>Ms. Sarah Allen, MMESO South Clinical Analyst, Phone 210-292-3287, Email Sarah.L.Allen24.ctr@mail.mil - Kevin Hill, MMESO South Team Leader, Phone 210) 292-3270, Email kevin.w.hill1ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Adult Incentive Spirometers. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1110-02_Adult_Incentive_Spirometers are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Adult Incentive Spirometers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1110-02_Adult_Incentive_Spirometers. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is March 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL MS-1110-02_Adult_Incentive_Spirometers, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Adult Incentive Spirometers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Adult Incentive Spirometers. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $448,595.25 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MS-1110-02_Adult_Incentive_Spirometers who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this RFIAQ via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />Adult Incentive Spirometers pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this RFIAQ.<strong> Vendors not currently on the QSL for Adult Incentive Spirometers will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO MS-1110-02_Adult_Incentive_Spirometers. Vendor must provide responses to the RFIAQ via the IA FBO Package Worksheet.</strong> Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide pricing for the following items listed in response to the SA FBO posting. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price. Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>
<p>Item Descriptions /&nbsp;Annual Usage in Units <br />Adult Incentive Spirometers, 2.5 Liters with 1-Way Valve&nbsp; / 45,116<br />Adult Incentive Spirometers, 4 or 5 Liters with 1-Way Valve&nbsp; / 42,023</p>
<p>2. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the SA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK DECEMBER 19, 2013<br />REQUISITION NUMBER: NCNM7300-14-00259<br />OFFICE FURNITURE MOVE TO HILO, HAWAI&lsquo;I FOR<br />PAPAH&#256;NAUMOKU&#256;KEA MARINE NATIONAL MONUMENT<br />Introduction<br />The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a United States Federal agency dedicated to understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and to conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet United States economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA is the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine protected areas as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by NOAA, protects a network of special marine and freshwater areas. The goal of the NMSA is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses. Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, identify staffing and budget needs, set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary. On June 15, 2006, George Bush established the Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument (Monument) by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain. The 1,200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also one the most remote archipelagos in the world.</p>
<p>At a time when ocean resources around the world are in major decline, the designation of the Monument enabled nearly 140,000 square miles of the region to receive the highest form of marine environmental protection in the United States, creating one of the largest protected marine areas in the world.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2010, the Monument was inscribed as a mixed World Heritage Site for its outstanding natural and cultural attributes. A designation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Heritage sites safeguard for humanity the most universal and significant aspects of our global natural and cultural heritage.</p>

 This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity  
 in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design           
 capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified   
 source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The     
 approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical   
 data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or    
 knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate    
 source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's           
 procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The  
 qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering        
 activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.        
 The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  
 as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not     
 been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.  Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have    
 been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally    
 such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you 
 are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the   
 information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)  
 Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

 These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on

 this is an item you have never made.                                            If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS 
 submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request 
 for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required  
 by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data    
 required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award      
 under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval      
 request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval        
 requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should offerors require additional clarification, notify the point of contact or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>FULL TEXT SOLICITATION PROVISIONS</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible contractor whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor I. - Technical Approach<br />Subfactor a) Technical Ability<br />Subfactor b) Quality Control System <br />Factor II. - Past Performance<br />Factor III. - Price</p>
<p>The above evaluation factors are listed in their order of importance. Non-price factors when combined are more important than price. As proposals become equal in this area, price may be the determining factor for contract award. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offeror to obtain best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Approach: (Proposal Section II):<br />Offerors are required to describe in sufficient detail the information listed in the subfactors below.</p>
<p>Subfactor a) Technical Ability:<br />Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the offerors ability to perform the work in accordance with the requirements of the SOW with emphasis on addressing the following:</p>
<p>1. Ability to overhaul the equipment in accordance with the required technical data including any updates to technical data that may be issued during contract performance<br />2. The test equipment that shall be used during the overhaul process<br />3. Information about the calibration program<br />4. The Offerors approach in providing an Airworthiness Certification on all overhauled equipment. <br />5. Proposals shall describe the offerors approach to meet required delivery schedules. Offerors may diagram their deliveries in a flow chart.</p>
<p>Subfactor b) Quality Control System: <br />Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the offerors Quality Control System that will be used in performance of the contract with emphasis on the following:</p>
<p>1. Inspection procedures<br />2. Personnel involved in the inspection process including their qualifications and responsibilities<br />3. Traceability of replacement parts to the OEM<br />4. Warranty terms</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance (Proposal Section III):<br />Past performance will be evaluated for a performance risk assessment and will be considered the quality of the contractor's past performance in timeliness of delivery, quality issues and their resolution, and customer satisfaction. Attachment 7 is the "Offerors Past Performance Questionnaire". Offerors must include a complete questionnaire with their proposal for one (1) customer reference. The Government reserves the right to use past performances information obtained from other sources such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and Government personnel who are experienced with the offerors performance.</p>
<p>Factor III - Price (Proposal Section IV):<br />An offerors proposal, to be considered for award, must price at least one CLIN, including prices for inspection/no fault found, scrap charge, and the composite hourly labor rate for each contract year to be considered complete.</p>
<p>The proposal price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Prices that are extremely high or low in relation to the Government's estimate may be judged unrealistic and may indicate that the contractor has misunderstood the nature of the work to be performed. Therefore, price/cost reasonableness and price/cost realism will be evaluated. Offerors shall understand that low priced proposals perhaps to accept little or no profit or to operate at a loss in order to win new work will be viewed negatively by the Government in assessing the offers understanding of the risk associated with its proposal.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single contract for the repair or overhaul of all equipment listed in the Schedule of Supplies or Services but reserves the right to break out CLINs and award more than one contract if determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.</p>

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>

<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE AND OBLIGATION IN ADVANCE OF FUNDS Performance under this contract has been designated by the United States Coast Guard as necessary for avoidance of imminent threat(s) to the safety of human life or the protection of property and this work is excepted from the restriction under 31 U.S.C. &sect; 1341, Limitations on expending and obligating amounts, against creating an obligation in advance of appropriated funds. Accordingly, despite the fact that appropriated funds are not presently available to make all payments under this contract (order), the contractor is authorized to perform under the contract; the government will make payments otherwise required by the contract once the Department of Homeland Security is provided appropriated funds for this contract. The Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor immediately upon DHS receiving or failing to receive such appropriated funds and shall make such funds received available for payment under this contract within 60 days.</p>

<DESC>The following Questions were asked and answered:<br /><br />1. Par 5.1 (2) - Is the Telemetry content different for each of the 6 streams that have to be demodulated post-flight? Are the streams supplied as RF or IF signals? Do they have to be decommutated and displayed as in real-time?
<p>A: The content could potentially be different on the 6 streams. The streams will be PCM. Yes, there will be a real-time display.</p>
<p>2. Par 5.2 (2c) - What is the aggregate bit rate of the 29 streams? Do they have different bit rates, and if so - what are the bit rates?</p>
<p>A: Aggregate shouldn't exceed 20 Mbps for all of the 29 streams combined. If in the future a mission flies the Vibration Measurement System (VMS), that would increase to 46 Mbps. The individual bit rates are 819.2 Kbps, 1.6 Mbps, and 500 Kbps. VMS runs at 3.2 Mbps.</p>
<p>3. Par 5.2 (5d) - What is meant by multiplexing 6 streams into a single file or more? Is the single file mandatory or an option, i.e. can the streams be recorded into 6 files?</p>
<p>A: The recorder has to ability to multiplex at least 6 incoming PCM data streams into a single file.</p>
<p><br />4. Par 5.2 (5e) - Do the 8 channels have the same IRIG time tag?</p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
<p>5. Par 5.5 (3) - What is the relationship between 5 Mbps and 3.2 Mbps in Par<br />5.2 (2e)?</p>
<p>A: 3.2 Mbps is the requirement for the input to the best data engine.<br />5.0 Mbps is the requirement for the input to the processing server.</p>
<p>6. Par 5.5 (18) - What is the reason for 96GB of RAM? It is not clear why this extremely large RAM is needed for the bit-rates, number of telemetry parameters, data processing and display requirements defined in the specification.</p>
<p>A: Customer requirement.</p>
<p>7. Par 5.5 (22) - What is the reason for 1 TFLOP? It is not clear why this tremendous processing power is needed for the bit-rates, number of telemetry parameters, data processing and display requirements defined in the specification.</p>
<p>A: Customer requirement.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 30 DEC 13 08:00PM.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 24HRS PRIOR TO CLOSING. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.

Please see Attachment A) <BR> <BR>As referenced in http://cfr.regstoday.com/48cfr1352.aspx <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999).

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for the Piranha/Raptor text mining technologies. The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through January 31, 2014.<br />&nbsp;
<p>ORNL's Piranha, Raptor, and DTHSTR text mining technologies solve the challenge most users face: finding a way to sift through large amounts of data that provide accurate and relevant information. This requires software that can quickly filter, relate, and show documents and relationships. Piranha is JavaScript search, analysis, storage, and retrieval software for uncertain, vague, or complex information retrieval from multiple sources such as the Internet. With the Piranha suite, researchers have pioneered an agent approach to text analysis that uses a large number of agents distributed over very large computer clusters. Piranha is faster than conventional software and provides the capability to cluster massive amounts of textual information relatively quickly due to the scalability of the agent architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Note: This technology is currently licensed non-exclusively to several companies.&nbsp; Any exclusive license will be field-of-use limited and will preserve the rights already granted under existing non-exclusive licenses.<br /><br /></strong><br />While computers can analyze massive amounts of data, the sheer volume of data makes the most promising approaches impractical. Piranha works on hundreds of raw data formats, and can process data extremely fast, on typical computers. The technology enables advanced textual analysis to be accomplished with unprecedented accuracy on very large and dynamic data. For data already acquired, this design allows discovery of new opportunities or new areas of concern. Piranha has been vetted in the scientific community as well as in a number of real-world applications.</p>
<p>The Raptor technology enables Piranha to run on SharePoint and MS SQL servers and can also operate as a filter for Piranha to make processing more efficient for larger volumes of text. The Raptor technology uses a set of documents as seed documents to recommend documents of interest from a large, target set of documents. The computer code provides results that show the recommended documents with the highest similarity to the seed documents.</p>
<p>The DTHSTR technology provides a user with a personalized, humanly manageable list of documents from a significantly larger, unmanageable set of documents without the user performing keyword searches. DTHSTR reduces the amount of direct user input (typing, purchases, shopping carts, search terms) and maximizes the use of desired user context (text in documents, text on web pages). Innovatively combining the use of text categorization, extraction, and clustering allows DTHSTR to push relevant information (or tags) to users solely based on the documents shared or provided to the engine. Results are fast, efficient, and targeted to the specific interests of each user regardless of the application domain. DTHSTR can also operate as a filter for the Piranha technology, enabling analysis of even larger volumes of documents.</p>
<p>Technology descriptions, publications, etc. can be found at: <br /><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/piranha">http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/piranha</a> <br />and<br /><a href="http://www.ut-battelle.org/pftt/docs/201202870_201102668_50000040_PFTT_FFC.pdf">http://www.ut-battelle.org/pftt/docs/201202870_201102668_50000040_PFTT_FFC.pdf</a></p>
<p>License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States based businesses and small businesses.</p>

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p><br />The International Law Enforcement and Narcotics (INL) Section in the U.S. Embassy in Tajikistan coordinates and implements law enforcement, border security and criminal justice technical assistance programs in Tajikistan funded by the Department of State in accordance with an agreement between the U.S. and the Government of Tajikistan (GOTI). INL's strategy in Tajikistan aims to reform Tajikistan's law-enforcement and justice-sector institutions so that its criminal justice system is more responsive to the needs of its citizens and communities. INL Dushanbe's justice sector programs aim to strengthen the rule of law and ensure the protection of the legal rights and human rights. A major project implemented by the American Bar Association's Rule of Law Initiative addresses reform of the defense bar and rule of law education. INL also develops rule of law in Tajikistan by conducting legal training for judges, defense attorneys, and law students; improving access to justice; strengthening local bar associations; reforming the existing criminal code; and monitoring court cases to ensure compliance with local and international norms. INL's community policing program supports the goal of promoting criminal justice sector reform. Community policing is aimed to generate an understanding of and support for democratic and community-oriented policing among key leaders in the GOTI Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), and improve trust between the police and the community, by building collaborative police-community partnerships.</p>
<p>The INL Section home bureau is Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

The advisor will manage the day-to-day implementation, direction, execution and oversight of community policing and justice sector reform projects to promote a more responsive criminal justice system accountable to the needs of Tajik citizens. The CJA will also support INL program development and assist in the implementation of the other law enforcement and counternarcotics portfolios in Tajikistan.</p>

<p>4) Draft/review technical and programmatic documents, including funding and information memoranda and letters, project work plans, budgets, and reports, talking points, briefing materials, official informal entries, and official cables.</p>
<p>5) Coordinate and communicate INL approved policies on police and criminal justice reform programs with U.S., international and GOTI agencies. As directed, participate in outreach activities with host country and international law enforcement members to increase awareness of INL programs and policies.</p>

<p>5. Shipping Advance Replacement - To deliver parts the FBOP site as soon as possible, this SOW requires the Vendor to pay all of the costs to ship advance replacement parts for overnight delivery.</p>
<p>6. Defective Parts - To ensure a continuous turnover of Like for Like Replacement Parts, the FBOP site will return defective parts to the appropriate service center within thirty (30) days of receipt of advance replacement parts.</p>
<p>7. Shipping Defective Parts to the Repair Center - This SOW requires the FBOP site to pay all of costs to ship defective parts to the appropriate repair facility.</p>
<p>8. Non-returned Parts - In the event defective parts are not returned to the appropriate service center within thirty (30) days of receipt of advance replacement parts, this SOW authorizes the Vendor to invoice the FBOP site for the advance replacement parts at the price listed in Federal Supply Schedule Contract GS-35F-0399Y.</p>
<p>9. Limitations- Like for Like Replacement Parts is specifically intended to furnish replacement parts that may be required to restore a malfunctioning 2020 PBX to a normal operating condition and provide an exchange service for defective service spares. For this reason, this SOW does not require the Vendor to provide new parts except those rare occasions when other replacement parts are not ready for shipment on the day the Technical Assistance Center determines that advance replacement parts are required to restore a malfunctioning 2020 PBX to a normal operating condition and under no circumstances is the Vendor required to exchange new parts for service spares sent in for repair.</p>
<p>24 X 7 Technical Assistance - To provide technical assistance and support whenever needed, the Vendor will maintain a Technical Assistance Center which will answer calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year including Holidays</p>
<p>Guaranteed Telephone Response - To guarantee the highest level of technical assistance and support, the Vendor will ensure the Telephone Assistance Center is staffed by technicians with field experience and the highest level of 20-20 certifications 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year including Holidays</p>
<p>Configuration Support - To support FBOP Communications Specialists and Technicians when they are performing Moves, Adds and Changes to the 2020 PBX, the Technical Assistance Center will be available to answer questions, furnish guidance and/or render assistance when problems arise.</p>
<p>1. Limitations - Configuration Support is intended to provide assistance to FBOP Communications Specialist and Technicians when they encounter difficulties and this SOW does not require the Technical Assistance Center to administer Moves, Adds and Changes to the 2020 PBX. For this reason, this SOW only requires the Technical Assistance Center to provide this service to FBOP Communications Specialists and Technicians that are registered with the Technical Assistance Center as certified to work on the 2020 PBX.</p>
<p><br />Troubleshooting Analysis and Diagnostic Research - To assist FBOP Communications Specialists, Technicians and other staff in restoring a malfunctioning 2020 PBX to a normal operating condition, the Technical Assistance Center will provide repair and maintenance consultation to those locations with the facilities and equipment for remote diagnostics.</p>
<p>1. Limitations - Troubleshooting analysis and diagnostic research is only available to those locations where the FBOP has installed the facilities and equipment for remote diagnostics. For this reason, this SOW does not require the Technical Assistance Center to provide this service to any location without the facilities and equipment for remote diagnostics.</p>
<p><br />Application Support - To support software applications implemented at the FBOP, the Technical Assistance Center will provide assistance by remote access and/or by duplicating the application on a 2020 system that has been installed at the Technical Assistance Center as an FBOP test system.</p>
<p>1. Limitations - Application Support is available when assistance is needed to diagnose service and configuration issues with 2020 systems that are operating at the current generic software release or the generic release immediately preceding the most current one. For this reason, this SOW only requires the Technical Assistance Center to provide this service to those locations with 2020 systems with remote access and operating at the current generic software release or the generic release immediately preceding the most current release. This SOW does not require the Technical Assistance Center to provide this service to sites without remote access or sites where the operating software is obsolete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software Version Updates and Point Releases - To enhance the ability of the Technical Assistance Center to diagnose service and configuration issues faster and more efficiently, the Vendor will provide Software Version Updates and/or Point Releases to ensure that the 2020 system is operating with the current generic software release or the generic release immediately preceding the most current release.</p>
<p>1. Limitations - If the hardware of any of the PBX Systems listed on Schedule A of this SOW will not support a Software Version Update and/or Point Release, the FBOP will be responsible for obtaining the required hardware. For this reason, this SOW requires the Vendor to issue advance notice of any hardware upgrades that may be required to support an upcoming Software Version Update or Point Release. To ensure that the FBOP has adequate time to accomplish any hardware upgrades that may be required to support a Software Version Update or Point Release, the Technical Assistance Center will support the current software version for a period of one year after the new Software Version Update or Point Release is first available for installation.</p>
<p><br />Software Release Notes - To ensure that FBOP Communications Specialists and Technicians have access to information relative to the performance of the 20-20 PBX System, the Vendor will provide software release notes, technical alert notes and other published information to each of the sites listed on Schedule A of this SOW.</p>
<p><br />Computerized Database for Tracking and Reporting - To respond quickly and effectively to all calls received by the Technical Assistance Center, the Vendor will use a computerized database to open trouble tickets and tracking pertinent information until the FBOP reports the problem has been resolved. For this reason, this SOW prohibits the Technical Assistance Center from closing any trouble ticket until the FBOP notifies the Technical Assistance Center reports that the problem has been resolved. If such notification is not provided within 30 days, this SOW requires the Vendor to advise the FBOP Points of Contacts listed in this SOW about the unresolved problem.</p>
<p><br />IV. PROJECT COORDINATION</p>
<p>The BOP will appoint a Contract Officer's Representative (COR) for this project.<br />The COR is responsible accepting the services provided for this requirement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract, providing direction to the contractor which clarifies the contract effort, fill in details, or otherwise serves to accomplish the contractual scope of work, evaluates performance, and certifies all invoices/vouchers for acceptance of the services furnished for payment prior to forwarding the original invoice to the payment office and a copy to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>The COR does not have the authority to alter the contractor's obligations under the contract action, direct changes that fall within the changes clause, and/or modify any of the expressed terms, conditions, specifications, or cost of this agreement.

<p>Each contractor employee with access to FBOP-IT equipment shall have security investigations commensurate with the highest level of information processed by the system. The Human Resource Manager or Personnel Security Officer shall determine the level of security clearance required.</p>
<p>A critical-sensitive position will be required to have a full field investigation (BI), and a non-critical sensitive position will be required to have a limited background investigation (LBI), as defined in the Human Resource Management Manual. For those contractors who will not have access to the sensitive data, appropriate security checks will be completed commensurate with BOP security regulations.</p>
<p>NOTE: The BOP may permit other Government security clearances to be substituted for the above back ground investigation, if determined by the BOP to be equal, current, and provided the contractor submits adequate documentation to support the BOP's determination.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned background investigations, the BOP security requirements include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Requirements listed below are based on the level of security required.</p>
<p>A) National Crime Information Center (NCIC)<br />B) National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI)<br />C) Law Enforcement Agency Checks;<br />D) National Law Enforcement Telecommunication (NLETS) checks;<br />E) Credit Checks;<br />F) Finger Print Checks (FD-258)<br />G) Completed OF-306, Declaration of Federal Employment and Appropriate Resume and Optional Application;</p>

<p>Note: If a urinalysis test is required, the test will be administered at the closest BOP facility where the work is performed. If the test is positive for drug usage, the individual(s) assigned to perform the work shall be excluded and the contractor shall provide acceptable replacement personnel subject to the same security requirements.</p>
<p>Access to IT sensitive information will be based on the completion of a successful background investigations and security clearances, to include the receipt of a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) case number. Once a decision has been rendered by the Personnel Security Officer that contract personnel are suitable for access to the appropriate IT system, notification will be made in writing to the technical point of contact and the respective contracting officer. The contracting officer will then issue a Notice to Proceed and the contractor and subcontractor will then have authority to commence contract performance.</p>

<DESC>The National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) provides technical and administrative support on behalf of the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council. The NSET Subcommittee is the coordinating body for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).
<p>The NSET Subcommittee has approved a budget that includes funds for NNCO to subscribe to the LRNI service for FY14. This service will provide access for all NSET Subcommittee members to the series of reports on nanotechnology that LUX Research has prepared over the past several years, and any new reports that they publish over the coming year. These reports are the most frequently cited source of information on nanotechnology investment trends and market opportunities, both within the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The breadth of detailed information available through the LRNI service is not available from any other source. The NSET Subcommittee requires access to the LUX Research information in order to be better able to compare other sources of information to the LUX Research information, and therefore to evaluate the validity of the highly cited LUX Research reports. Purchasing this subscription to the LRNI service will also provide NNCO staff members and NSET Subcommittee members with direct access to LUX Research analysts who prepared these reports, and will therefore enable direct communication concerning the methodologies that LUX has been using to develop its nanotechnology reports, thus allowing for better assessment of the validity of those reports. <br /><br />The period of performance will be the base year of January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2014, with one option year with a period of January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015.<br /><br />Firms that believe they can supply an equivalent product are invited to submit capability statements no later than December 31, 2013, for consideration by the NSF.</p>

<DESC><p>The Receiver Technology Section of the Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) Branch at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is developing a radio frequency (RF) Signal Conditioning and Distribution System (SCDS). The SCDS provides configurable connectivity between sensor assets and signal processor assets. The SCDS accepts outputs of the sensor systems, which can be broadly categorized into five suites of systems: Sensor System A, B, C, D, and E. The SCDS provides inputs to mission system equipment, which can be broadly categorized into 5 suites of equipment: Mission System A, Mission System B, Mission System C, Mission System D and Mission System E.&nbsp; The development relevant to this RFP pertains to three SCDS subsystems: Unit Type 1, Unit Type 2 and Unit Type 3. The work required by this contract shall be performed in accordance with A-level specifications and a statement of work (SOW), which will be available with the solicitation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, test, and deliver units as listed in the SOW to meet the performance criteria specified by the A-level specifications and in accordance with the detailed requirements in the SOW. The contractor shall adhere to these requirements for each of the following three constituent subsystems:<br />&#9679; Unit Type 1: 9x8 RF Switch Matrix<br />&#9679; Unit Type 2: Ganged 2x1 Switches<br />&#9679; Unit Type 3: 94x110 Broadband Switch Matrix</p>
<p>Spares and support services for installation and repair will be required.&nbsp;The final systems' check-out will be performed at&nbsp;NRL, Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The work required by this contract requires accessing information classified at the SECRET level. Contractor personnel shall have a current, valid, and final SECRET clearance granted by the Department of Defense by date of contract award.</p>
<p>A fixed-price indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated.</p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the supplies and services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p>NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) requires the services of a geotechnical engineering firm to provide Architect/Engineer (AE) design services for the reclamation of hazardous abandoned coal mine areas.  The hazards at the abandoned coal mine sites primarily consist of open shafts and portals, mine subsidence, venting mine gases, and mine drainage.  Other hazards may include mine fires, mine facilities, mine waste piles, and unstable high walls.  Emergency hazards, such as the sudden collapse of shafts, portals, or mine workings, will also require design services under this Scope of Work (SOW).
Generally, the engineering work will include site investigations; exploratory drilling or excavation; sampling and analysis of mine gases and mine drainage; surveys and development of site maps; development of reclamation design alternatives; design development for the selected alternative; identification of environmental effects of the proposed construction; technical support for obtaining environmental permits; preparation of construction specifications and plans; construction cost estimating; participation in public, pre bid, and pre construction meetings; monitoring of construction activities; preparation of reports for the various tasks completed; and other work elements as specified in the Delivery Orders.  Each Delivery Order will specify the work elements to be completed for each project site.

<AWARDEE>EDO Corp., 5900 Venture Crossings Blvd, Panama City , FL 32409 US
<DESC>10 USC 2304 (c) (1) <br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to EDO Corporation, 430 West 5th Street, Suite 600, Panama City, Florida 32401-6357. This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105 and the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS 53). The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required. Under this IDIQ, EDO will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105 and AMNS 53 systems. This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions. This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. a) EDO is the manufacturer and the only source for the two systems listed above. As such, only EDO has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above. EDO is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems. EDO is the Software Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105 and AMNS 53 systems. The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at EDO under Contractor control. b) Given the complexity of the MK-105 and AMNS systems and the level of system knowledge required overhauling and repairing this complex equipment and systems, EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking. c) This is a follow-on to contract N61331-09-D-0005 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government. SYNOPSIS MOD DESCRIPTION:<br />The synopsis modification provides a change in information as follows. The PIIN is changed from <br />N61331-11-R-0021 to N61331-12-R-0002. The Solicitation issue date is changed to 7 Feb 2012 and the close date is changed to 8 Mar 2012. <br />

<DESC>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Manufacturer/Contractor: Cepheid	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 904 Caribbean Dr., Sunnydale, CA 94089	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	NCO-6___________________________
		27 Averill Rd.______________________
	Hampton, VA 23667	
	     	
                                                                          VISN:	6	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of MRSA test kits against Cepheid's FSS schedule V797P-5967X.	


(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The Durham VAMC is requesting 120 test- count MRSA Test Kits, product number GXMRSA-120.  The test kits are used to screen inpatients for MRSA infections.  The test kits are used in conjunction with a test instrument owned by the Durham VAMC.  	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $235,734.14	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   1/1/2014-9/30/2014	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  
The test kits are used in the station's GenXprt testing system, which is currently used to screen patients for MRSA.  The Durham VAMC owns the test instrument and Cepheid is the only manufacturer that produces test kits for use in the analyzer.  	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The Contracting Officer has determined that placing this order against Cepheid's FSS schedule represents the best value to the Government as the station owns the test instrument and the instrument and test methods have been validated and calibrated by each lab.  The system also allows for samples to be run immediately upon delivery to the laboratory, thus decreasing the time to diagnosis and improving the quality of care offered by the medical center.	


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A competitive solicitation to establish a BPA for MRSA testing solutions will be posted to GSA eBuy, with an anticipated start date is 10/1/2014.  Market research indicates other sources are potentially available but are currently renegotiating FSS contracts with the NAC.   Until the NAC contracts are awarded and FSS offerings can be reviewed, Cepheid remains the best value for the VISN-6 medical centers.	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
The station purchased a Cepheid analyzer in 2008.  The analyzer design allows for an infinite useful life because any system changes are incorporated into the disposable test cartridge, and all tests are backwards compatible with the Cepheid equipment.	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
VISN-6 will issue a competitive solicitation on GSA eBuy to establish a BPA(s) for MRSA automated test solutions to begin 10/1/2014.
