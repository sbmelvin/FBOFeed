The Blue Coat software aids in the process of content filtering for unauthorized sites as well as filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the DoS mission critical operating environment.
As this is a Brand Name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments core firewall infrastructure. 
This is an urgently needed, highly-specialized, best-fit requirement, based upon prior utilization of Blue Coat products, maintenance, and support.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is not a Notice of Solicitation.  The Department of Energy,NationalNuclear Security Administration (DOE NNSA), is planning to conduct acompetitive acquisition using procedures delineated in FAR Part 15.  Theanticipated effective date for the new contract is October 2009.The scope of work will require the contractor to be capable of providing arange of information technology and communications support services for theDOENNSA Office of Secure Transportation.  The Office of Secure Transportation(OST) provides safe and secure transportation of nuclear weapons andcomponentsand special nuclear materials, and conducts other missions supporting thenational security of the United States of America.  In support of thismission,the OST maintains an extensive Command and Control, Communications,Computersand Cyber Security (C5) infrastructure to manage planning, scheduling,resourceand asset management, operational tracking and monitoring of mobile assets,andconsequence management.  The OST C5 organization also manages IT solutionsforOST business functions that support the core mission, such as projectmanagement and enterprise asset control.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for thisrequirement is 517919, All Other Telecommunications, with a small businesssizestandard of $25 Million.DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT.  The draft Performance Work Statement(PWS)is provided (Attachment 1) to facilitate industry planning and preparationsinadvance of a formal Request for Proposal.  General comments and suggestionsregarding the PWS, suggested pricing (contract type), and suggestedcontractline item structure is requested.SEEKING CAPABLE SOURCES.  To assist with determining industry interest,capability and whether the proposed acquisition can be set-aside for smallbusiness concerns, interested firms are asked to submit an Expression ofInterest (EOI) and Statement of Capabilities (SOC).DOE NNSA OST is seeking sources for the proposed contract encompassinginformation technology and telecommunications life-cycle support tasksassociated with various OST operational and operational support systems,including: Requirements Engineering:  Conduct needs assessment and requirementsanalysisas part of the normal system life cycle, and as emerging needs areidentifiedby operational or business units. Independent Test and Evaluation:  Conduct test and evaluation ofdevelopmental systems prior to production and deployment as part of anormalquality assurance effort for mission support and business supportIT/telecommunications systems. Application Development and Support:  Develop and/or maintain variousapplications that support the organizations operational mission andbusinessprocesses.  Most of the organizations applications are database-driven,usinga web-based interface based on the Microsoft ASP .Net environment. Multi-Level Security (MLS) Architecture and Network Engineering andSupport:Develop and support solutions within the OSTs MLS environment, includingdevelopment of solutions, IT system administration, hardware maintenanceandother life-cycle support functions.  Strong experience with MLS solutionsisneeded, particularly those accepted in the Department of Defenseenvironment. Telecommunications Engineering and Support:  Develop and supportsolutionspertaining to command and control communications and communicationssecuritybetween OST mobile units and the OST command authorities.  The OST alsomaintains of a group of five telecommunications relay stations in CONUS.Thisgeneral area may include evaluation/assessment of solutions proposed to theOSTby other government and private developers as well as actual developmentandsupport. Cyber Security:  Support OST efforts in the areas of programmatic andtechnical cyber security with regard to OST systems and major applications.The OST follows NNSA cyber security policies that are consistent with OMBCircular A-130, the Federal Information Security Management Act, andNationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information ProcessingStandards and Special Publications.Under the proposed contract, services currently provided by approximately30employees under multiple contracts would be consolidated.  The majority ofthese employees are at the OST Headquarters location in Albuquerque, NM,whilea smaller number of support staff members are at other OST locations inAmarillo, TX; Fort Smith, AR; and Oak Ridge, TN.   OST telecommunicationsstations are located in ID, MD, MO, NM, SC.As a result of the sensitive nature of the DOE NNSA OST mission, thesuccessfulcontractor, and its subcontractors or team members, will be required tohave anaffirmative determination of Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence(FOCI).In addition, many contractor personnel performing on the contract will berequired to obtain and maintain DOE Level L or Q level security clearances.Since this sources sought synopsis is being used strictly to determine ifsufficient small business capability exists to set this acquisition aside,large businesses should not reply. In order to be evaluated as capable forpurpose of a set aside determination, a small business must be able toperforma majority of the draft PWS.   Given the type, size, and complexity of workenvisioned for this requirement, DOE NNSA recommends that small businessesshould consider teaming arrangement. In accordance with Federal AcquisitionRegulation (FAR 9.603), the Government will recognize the integrity andvalidity of contractor team arrangements; provided the arrangements areidentified and company relationships are fully disclosed in an offer or,forarrangements entered into after submission of an offer, before thearrangementbecomes effective. A contractor team arrangement is one where two or morecompanies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential primecontractor or a prime contractor agrees with one or more companies to havethemact as its subcontractors under a specified Government contract oracquisitionprogram. Small businesses can form a number of teaming arrangements thatmayinclude, but not be limited to: prime/sub,  SBA-approved Mentor Protg, ajoint venture, SBA-approved Mentor Protg Joint Venture. Small businessesshould consult applicable regulations related to the teaming approach underconsideration to ensure compliance with the size standard (e.g.,affiliationrules or subcontracting limitations).The EOI shall state whether the concern is a Small Business, SmallDisadvantaged Business, 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business,Woman-Owned Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business or aService-disabledVeteran-owned small business and shall not exceed two (2) pages. The SOC shall not exceed ten (10) pages and shall include the interestedfirms complete mailing address, point of contact (name, telephone number, ande-mail address). The SOC shall also disclose any prime/sub, SBA-approvedMentorProtg, joint venture, or SBA-approved Mentor Protg Joint Venturearrangement. The SOC shall list the prime contract (and significantsubcontractor) work performed by all teaming partners since February 2003including (1) a brief description of experience with each of the functionalareas including the magnitude, complexity and criticality of the workperformed, (2) name and address of the contracting activity, (3) name andtelephone number of the contracting officers technical representative and(4)prime contract number. Contractors must provide a narrative for eachcontractor subcontract addressing how its experience directly relates to thespecifictechnical knowledge and capabilities requirements identified above andassociated with the draft PWS. The SOC should include statement to whetherafirm has a current affirmative Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence(FOCI)determination, the date the determination was rendered, and the currentlevelof security clearance possessed by the firm. In addition to the above,providea statement describing how your company might propose to perform thepercentageof work specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14(b)(2) -- (Atleast 50 percent of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel shallbeexpended for employees of the concern). If two or more business concernshaveformed a joint venture or teaming arrangement, identify the demonstratedcapabilities of each business to perform the work described in theTechnicalRequirements section above and the roles and responsibilities of eachbusinessin the accomplishment of the requirements.Respondents must submit responses to the draft PWS, and the EOI and SOC, nolater than 5 PM Mountain Time on December 31, 2008, athttp://e-center.doe.gov.  Only electronic copies sent to this site will beaccepted.  Any questions or comments regarding this announcement should bee-mailed to lbuffkins@doeal.gov or submitted thru IIPS. Telephone responsesandinquiries will not be accepted.This notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates theGovernment to award any contract. DOE NNSA will not be responsible for anycosts incurred by responding to this Notice. No solicitation exists at thistime. Please be advised that all information submitted will be consideredprocurement sensitive. Information which the Contractor considers Bid andProposal Information or Proprietary Information pursuant to existing lawsandregulations must be marked accordingly [see FAR 3.104-1 (3) & (4)].

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition intends to solicit on a sole source (FAR 13) basis with the Europaisches Laboratorium Fur Molekularbiologie Meyerhofstrasse 1, Heidelberg, Germany for services to demonstrate that a shared side-effect profile between drugs can be used to predict previously unknown drug targets and devise a computational measure for side-effect similarity.

As the side-effects produced by the pharmaceutical entities with high potential for subsequent abuse are easily distinguishable, NIDA is interested in investigating whether the unambiguous curation of euphoria-related side-effects would be useful in identifying the new molecular targets not previously associated with the classical drugs of abuse. In the initial proof-of-principle study, the contractor will extract drug abuse-related side effects specifically from their symptoms library, and will analyze the feasibility of side effect similarity for target prediction of abusable drugs.   This data is only known to exist with the ELMM.

It is anticipated that the period of performance will be 8 months.  Place of performance is Heidelberg, Germany.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI847915 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Susan Nsangou, Contracting Officer.

Raytheon is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the ATFLIR Pod and owns the technical data rights. 
This ECP is to induce lower level design requirements at the optical supplier to eliminate the variability from pod to pod as to what secondary beams are present. This change will reduce the secondary beams to levels that are not a safety concern to the end user. This ECP develops test criteria and limits for evaluating fielded Electrical Optical Sensor Units (EOSUs), establishes marking requirements for screened and new EOSUs subassemblies and optical components, adds performance criteria to the optical components, and repairs EOSUs that do no meet test criteria.
Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities contact Raytheon.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price type contract to L-3 Communications Corp, Sylmar, CA for the development of a means for receiving GPS location data from the USV and populating the acoustic data fields with the GPS location and time. The contractor shall also develop a correction to the bearing accuracy issue. The period of performance is three months from the date of award.   The Helicopter Long-range Active Sonar (HELRAS) no! n-developmental hardware items (CAP, CIPS, SU and Cable and Reel) and the interface between the Launch and Handling System (L&HS) and the Mission System Common Acoustic Processor CAP were developed by L3 and Dynacon.  For any other source to acquire adequate knowledge to perform this work would take at least two years of effort, based on an estimated one year to study and learn the existing design and another year to make the required changes.  This delay in developing a second source would put the UDS Mission System at risk of participating in the At Sea End-to-End (Q2FY09), participating in the Distributed Force FY08 (Q3FY09), and meeting the delivery date to the SeaFrame (Q4FY09).  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notic! e of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Further details will be released upon issue of RFP #N66604-09-R-0962, which is anticipated to be on or about 12/24/2008.  Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. For information on this acquisition please contact Michael Broomfield at 401-832-8469,  michael.h.broomfield@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The clause requires that at least50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. A Firm Fixed-Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be negotiated and is anticipated to be awarded in February 2009. If the February 2009 date is not met, the one negotiated contract will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. The contract will be for a maximum of a one-year base period from the date of award and will contain options to extend four (4) additional one-year periods. The contract amount for the base period and any option will not exceed $300,000 for each period. The total contract amount shall not exceed $1,500,000. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. At the discretion of the government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted. If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract period. If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimate Price of the option period being exercised. At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period. The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $ 6,000. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).

Jordan  Smart Card Technology.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance related to the introduction of a national Smart Card.

Jordan has adopted a comprehensive Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector modernization as a principle agent for national transformation and development.  In March 2008, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) issued a Request for Information for a National Smart Card system, whereby interested companies describe their technologies, qualifications and solutions in a formal document to the ministry.  This is a way for MOI to learn more about the market and the state of technology.  MOI has been making concrete steps toward the implementation of the Smart Card Technology; however, it would benefit greatly from technically sound advice and recommendations to successfully implement this very complicated project.  The Technical Assistance consultant would assist the Government of Jordan in defining the strategy for the implementation of the Smart Card, identifying the governments needs, and determining how to shape the procurement.  MOI has planned to implement the Smart Card technology in three phases.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding would support the implementation of the first phase, which would include the national identity card, voting application, health insurance card, drug dispensing card, and an electronic authentication for online government services.  Phases two and three would expand the Smart Card to other areas that have not yet been formally defined. 

Jordans Smart Card project is a stated national priority project that has the personal support of the King, the Royal Court, the National Security and Crisis Management Center and the national government.  Through the implementation of the Smart Card project, Jordan seeks to stimulate and catalyze electronic transactions throughout the Jordanian government and economy.  The Smart Card system is intended as a centerpiece of Jordans overall e-government program.  Since Jordan is in the information gathering stage of the procurement process, it is precisely at this time that the government requires technical and management assistance to bring the project to fruition.  This project represents an opportunity for USTDA to make a significant impact on an important initiative.

The grant was signed by the Minister of Planning and International Cooperation on behalf of MOI.  While MOI is the primary implementing body, it is advised closely by the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology.

The study includes: an internal needs assessment; development of a Smartcard National Strategy Framework; risk analysis; identification of potential funding; legal and regulatory analysis; identification of vendor evaluation criteria; support of Request for Proposals document; detailed financial and economic analysis; a preliminary environmental impact assessment; and a development benefit assessment.  The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $410,083 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by November 10, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Intuitive Surgical Inc., 950 Kifer Road Sunnyvale, CA  94086, to purchase Surgical Instruments in accordance with FAR 6302.1.  The DaVinci Surgical System is a computer-enhanced minimally invasive surgical system consisting of three components: the InSite Vision System, Surgical Cart and Surgeon Console. The InSite Vision System provides the surgeon with a true minimally invasive 3-D view of the surgical field including depth of field, magnification and high resolution.  The Surgical Cart includes the EndoWrist instruments.  It has up to four robotic arms whereby the laparoscope and up to three EndoWrist instruments are inserted.  The EndoWrist instruments are designed to mimic the movement of the human hands, wrists, and fingers.  The extensive range of motion allows precision that is not available in standard minimally invasive procedures.  The Surgeon Console contains the master controls that the surgeon uses to manipulate the EndoWrist instruments.  The handles translate the surgeon's natural hand and wrist movements into corresponding, precise and scaled movements.  The EndoWrist instruments are only able to move when commanded by the surgeon.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, December 12, 2008, 4:30 p.m.  Responses should be sent to Joseph.Hotovchin@va.gov.No telephone responses will be accepted.  It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this equipment to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will proceed with the sole source procurement from Intuitive Surgical Inc.

I.   Background

Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for African American children ages 5-14, and the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths for African Americans of all ages.  A 1999, Meharry Medical College study, Achieving A Credible Health and Safety Approach to Increasing Seat Belt Use Among African Americans, disclosed a lower rate of seat belt use by African American motorists and identified the disparity in compliance as a public health crisis.  The study reported that increasing African American seat belt use to 100 percent could save as many as 1,300 lives, prevent 26,000 injuries, and save $2.6 billion every year.

In 2000, a Blue Ribbon Panel was created to increase seat belt use among African Americans.  The Blue Ribbon Panel released a Report to the Nation: Blue Ribbon Panel To Increase Seat Belt Use Among African Americans identified ten (10) recommendations likely to achieve better parity in seat belt use by African Americans.  The BRP and its report created momentum that energized national leadership to make seat belt use a priority agenda to help save lives.  It was through the active leadership and involvement of national African American leaders engaged at various levels that helped to heighten awareness of the seat belt use issue.  One such leader, the Meharry-State Farm Alliance, initiated a national effort to decrease preventable death and injury from motor vehicle crashes with its contributions of evidence-based research, community outreach and education, and public policy initiatives that helped stimulate increased seat belt use by African Americans. 

During the period 2000-2004, the combination of the Click It or Ticket campaign with intensive education and awareness by the Blue Ribbon Panel raised African American seat belt use to 80 percent, which exceeded the seat belt use of the national population during this time period.

According to 2007 National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS) data, African American seat belt use is at 75 percent.  This is eight percentage points lower than the 2007 national average of 83 percent and a five percentage point decrease from the use rate reported in 2004 of 80 percent.  While seat belt use for the general population climbed to 83 percent (2008 NOPUS), there are still substantial gaps in compliance among identifiable African American motorists.  The current strategies to reach certain segments of the African American population using traditional messages have not been as effective over the last several years, therefore, seat belt use has been on a steady decline. 
  
II.   Purpose

This contract will secure individual(s) and/or organization(s) to become the new voice for the seat belt issue and nationally raise awareness of the disparity in seat belt use between African Americans and other populations. Utilizing the knowledge gained in the 2000 Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) to Increase Seat Belt Use Among African Americans, the (individual(s) and/or organization(s) will seek to encourage nationally known African American individuals and organizations to take action to help address the growing problem of seat belt non-use in the African American community through creative and innovative approaches.  The individual(s) and/or organization(s) selected for this effort must have the ability to organize, reach, educate, and influence African American associations/organizations and their leadership at National, State, and local levels regarding African American seat belt use as an agenda item within their associations/organizations.  Additionally, the individual(s) and/or organization(s) must collaborate with law enforcement to support high-visibility enforcement while addressing the issue of racial profiling.  

III.    Mission

The challenge for this contract is to secure individual(s) and organization(s) to become the new voice for the seat belt issue and rally for increased seat belt use in the African American community.  The individual(s) and organization(s) will seek national organizations who will work collaboratively with law enforcement to help reduce the disparity in seat belt use between African Americans and other populations.   

IV.   Performance objectives

 Listed below are seven performance objectives that must be considered in carrying out the objectives of this effort. 

1.	Identify a contractor to recruit African American organizations in promoting African American seat belt use among their membership through collaboration and outreach.  

2.	Demonstrate a working knowledge of the 2000 Blue Ribbon Panel Recommendations and use these recommendations as a benchmark for initiating the next steps to increase national African American organizations involvement (see attached recommendations). 

3.	Secure commitments from national African American organizations that will influence a broader segment of the African American population with different and innovative communication tools, including community outreach to reach non-users. 

4.	Address national African American organizations to encourage them to increase seat belt use within its membership and to leverage the national organization support and resources to promote seat belt use to all Americans. 

5.	Hold meetings with public and private sector African American leaders to secure their participation in working toward increased and sustained belt use within the African American community. 

6.	Establish working relationships with Federal and State organizations that can help reaffirm and reinforce seat belt use as a national public health and safety priority in the African American community. 

7.	Work with law enforcement to support high visibility enforcement while addressing the issue of racial profiling.

<CONTACT>Karin A Weinert, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-1177, Email karin.weinert@navy.mil
<DESC>
2.0	Background
The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV) has a need for commonality of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) interfaces between Special Operations Forces (SOF) service components.  Current systems onboard FOSOV are co-located, but are independent; no solution currently exists that provides interoperable and supportable C4ISR capabilities across the wide range of platforms comprising the FOSOV.  
The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Special Communications Requirement Division (SCRD), on behalf of USSOCOM, Program Executive Office SOF Warrior (PEO-SW), PM for FOSOV located at MacDill Air Force Base, FL, is looking for information from companies for a solution to provide Non-Developmental Item (NDI) technologies to support an Integrated Bridge System (IBS) that integrates C4ISR, navigation, sensor, weapons, and platform monitoring and control functions on mobile platforms such as HMMWV, MRAP, and maritime combatant craft.  Implementation of a standard integration of subsystem equipment will minimize redundant capabilities, standalone systems, reduce program risks and costs, improve interoperability, reduce physical footprint, and simplify supportability.  

3.0	Purpose
FOSOV requires an IBS solution to allow integration of existing C4I, navigation, sensor, weapons, and platform monitoring and control functions at a single system/user interface.  
This is a follow-on to RFI N68335-09-RFI-0003 in which the government requested information from industry on Commercial-off-the-shelf solutions that would provide similar capabilities to those being sought in this RFI.  The objective is to have command and control of multiple subsystems from a single user interface and secondary to that is to be able to support the command and control (C2) role from multiple interfaces within the IBS.  Hence, the IBS solution must combine requirements, material solutions, and/or current subsystem that were previously standalone.  The IBS solution must allow the integration of the technologies currently contained within the FOSOV to meet the capability objectives of enabling C2 of SOF conducting irregular warfare (IW), surveillance and reconnaissance operations, or collecting/verifying intelligence data; and allowing real-time coordination with other mission participants (including coalition members) and higher and/or adjacent echelons.

3.1	Current Subsystems
The IBS solution must provide an integrated workstation(s) that permit operators to access, monitor, and control the following existing FOSOV subsystems:
	Falconview Subsystem. Provides GPS and navigation capabilities.  Includes one (1) rugged computer and one (1) serial GPS interface.
	Radio Subsystem. Includes AN/VIC-3(V) hardware, and the following external interfaces: six (6) user headsets, four (4) analog voice/PTT interfaces, 18-23 volts DC power, and three (3) Unused Serial Remote Control Interfaces (one (1) AN/PRC-117F or one (1) AN/PSC-5D, and two (2) AN/PRC-148(V)).
	Force XXI Battlefield Command Brigade and Below-Blue Force Tracker (FBCB2-BFT) Subsystem.  Provides on the move, near-real-time situational awareness (SA) to the vehicle mounted platform level.  Includes one (1) AN/UYK-128 processor Unit, one (1) keyboard unit, one (1) display unit, one (1) serial interface adapter device (SIAD), and one (1) MT-2011 antenna.  Also includes the following external interfaces: one (1) RF (L-band) FBCB2-BFT SA link, one (1) serial DAGR interface, and 20-33 volts DC power.
	Joint Tactical C4I Transceiver System (JTCITS) Subsystem.  Provides a robust tactical wireless network that directly links the individual soldier to imagery and sensor information. Includes the following hardware: one (1) Rover III/IV Receiver, one (1) Toughbook CF-19 Computer, two (2) Omni-directional Ku or C/L Frequency band antennas, and one (1) AC-DC/DC-DC Battery Eliminator.  Also includes the following external interfaces: one (1) RF data link in C, L, and Ku bands both analog and digital; one (1) Serial GPS Interface; one (1) Network Interface; 11-36 Volts DC or 95-270 volts AC, 47-440 Hz Power; and one (1) COMSEC port for future capabilities.
	Ground Mobility Visual Augmentation System (GMVAS) Subsystem.  Provides SOF operators the ability to navigate vehicles; conduct surveillance; and detect, identify, and track threats in all light and weather conditions.  Includes the following hardware: one (1) SR-GMVAS Sensor, one (1) FLIR Control Electronics Unit, one (1) Handheld Control Unit, one (1) System Junction Box, and one (1) LCD Display.  Also includes the following external interfaces: one (1) IR source, and 19-32 Volts DC Power.
	Platform Maintenance Subsystem. Monitors platform systems such as electrical power systems health, alternator, and reserve power capacity.  Includes one (1) Rugged Computer and one (1) CANbus/J1939 external interface.  
	Common Remotely Operated Weapon System (CROWS) II.  Provides the operator the ability to acquire and engage targets while remaining protected within the vehicle.  Includes one (1) exterior fixed mount.  External interfaces include a sensor unit which is comprised of one (1) day camera, one (1) Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), and one (1) laser rangefinder; and a fire control unit (FCU) which is comprised of one (1) display, switches, and one (1) joystick.

3.2	Objective
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is an optimized configuration and integrated solution for all necessary FOSOV processors, signal interfaces, network infrastructure, user interfaces, radios, and software to permit complete and efficient operation and management of the platform and its electronic systems.  The optimal solution will result in; at a minimum, the consolidation of like functions to reduce the number of computers within the FOSOV, thus resulting in the minimum number of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and achieve a reduction of Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) requirements, with size and weight being weighted most.  The desired outcome of the resultant IBS solution must reduce the physical footprint of FOSOV systems while maintaining flexibility to provide for future technology upgrades.  
Candidate IBS solution must allow for increased fault tolerance, provide reliable operation in harsh environmental conditions typical of tactical vehicles and maritime applications, and must be capable of accommodating future C4ISR developments while minimizing life cycle costs.  Additionally, candidate solution must be capable of accommodating FOSOVs short-term needs (i.e., ability to field in October 2009), while maintaining bridging abilities to allow expansion to meet long-term goals and future requirements.  

4.0	Other Variables
The vendor should identify any relationships with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), System Integrators (SIs), and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM).  Additionally, the vendor should identify any enhancements or capabilities that distinguishes their IBS solution from other solutions such as: range of features, open systems approach, modularity and scalability, human factors, ease of upgrade, or other relevant distinctions.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Yucca Mountain Project Branch (USGS-YMPB) has a requirement for hydrochemical modeling, using M3 software, of the Ash Meadows system which is part of the regional carbonate aquifer (RCA) using dissolved ion and isotope data supplied by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  During the past 11 years, the USGS-YMPB has conducted hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of ground water from wells and springs in the Yucca Mountain area of Southern Nevada.  This study is a follow on to hydrochemical modeling that Geopoint AB completed for the USGS on the Yucca Mountain--Amargosa Desert system.  The RCA discharges in the eastern Amargosa along a spring line at Ash Meadows.  Some flow continues in the RCA beneath alluvium and discharges into Death Valley.  Recharge to the RCA in the Ash Meadows system occurs in the Spring Mountains and from southerly flow from the eastern Nevada Test Site including old nuclear test areas in Frenchman Flat and Yucca Flat.  The groundwater that discharges at Ash Meadows is chemically and isotopically distinct from recharge in the Spring Mountains suggesting that recharge from the north may be significant.  A better understanding of the mixture of end-member ground-water compositions that discharge at Ash Meadows is essential for assessing potential upward leakage from the RCA beneath the Amargosa. The contractor will develop a detailed knowledge of the data set supplied by the USGS and an understanding of the potential recharge areas and flow paths that lead to the Ash Meadows spring line.  Further, the contractor will evaluate chemical and isotopic changes in the ground water beneath the Amargosa by modeling the Ash Meadows water relative to spring discharge in Death Valley.  The study will be completed in twelve (12) months with final report completed in eighteen (18) months, from date of award.
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from Geopoint AB, Fridshyddev 15, Sweden, and proposes, pending availability of funding, to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement. This Notice is issued, process to point of award, funds are not presently available.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID.  THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE, SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROCUREMENT COMMITMENT BY THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.  RESPONSE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR OR SUFFER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY IMPROPERLY IDENTIFIED INFORMATION.<BR><BR>The purpose of this sources sought is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of industry to perform construction services.  Responses are restricted to U.S. firms that are established and registered in Central Contract Registration (CCR).<BR><BR>The Government is seeking qualified, experienced sources capable of performing construction services for physical security/safety improvements in the New York City area (Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens Boroughs), on and around bridges.  The work is likely to include:<BR>1.	Construction of vehicle barrier systems (gates)<BR>2.	Installation of forced entry door and window treatments<BR>3.	Construction of access ladders and platforms<BR>4.	Reinforcement/modification of steel and masonry structures<BR>5.	Construction of cable, cable band and suspender rope covers<BR>6.	Construction of truss member covers<BR>7.	Construction of main cable anti-climb barriers<BR>8.	Construction of passive and active fire protection<BR>9.	Construction of utility buildings<BR>10.	Construction of backup electrical power systems<BR>11.	Construction of electronic security systems (video surveillance, intrusion detection, access control, command/control/communication centers)<BR><BR>Some work elements will include design features and/or areas of the bridges that are historically significant to the structure and the site in which they being constructed. <BR><BR>Most of the work will take place in locations adjacent to or in close proximity of active vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian and mass transit traffic areas.  Further, most of the work will require temporary closure of roadways, pedestrian and bike paths, and subways (maintenance and protection of traffic).  It is anticipated that other capital construction work (performed by others under separate contract) will be in progress during the performance of this work, and therefore may require coordination with other contractors.<BR><BR>Contractors and their employees may be subject to background checks. <BR><BR>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this work are 237310 (Highway, Street and Bridge Construction) and 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction).<BR><BR>It is anticipated that construction services will be procured via a single Indefinite Delivery Order contract to be awarded on a firm fixed-price basis.  The basis for awarding this work via one (1) Indefinite Delivery Contract is:<BR><BR>1.	One prime contractor will ensure that all work elements are properly integrated together to effect a fully functional security system.<BR>2.	One prime contractor will ensure that construction management and all coordination is effectively centralized for multiple bridges, including roadway and subway closures, and coordination with other ongoing capital construction work (performed by others under separate contract).<BR>3.	The indefinite delivery nature of the contract will provide the flexibility required to schedule the work of this contract around other ongoing capital construction work (performed by others under separate contract).  Task orders for specific work elements will be awarded as windows of opportunity become available.  Due to this constraint, work may not be continuous throughout the performance period.<BR>4.	One prime contractor will minimize distribution of security-sensitive plans and specifications.<BR><BR>The estimated cost of this work is between $400M and $500M.<BR><BR>All interested, capable, qualified and responsive members of industry are encouraged to reply to this announcement.   The Government is requesting that interested firms furnish the following information:<BR><BR>1.	Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and e-mail address.<BR>2.	Geographical areas in which you are capable of servicing.<BR>3.	Bonding capacity as of the date of your response.<BR>4.	State whether or not your firm and its employees currently have a security clearance, and if so, what level.  Indicate if your firm has a personnel assurance program (i.e., background screening and credentialing of personnel and workers) to insure safe and threat-free work sites.   <BR>5.	Indicate percent of total construction that is to be self-performed by direct-hire in-house resources.<BR>6.	Provide no more than three (3) references, for no more than three (3) of the most recent and relevant contracts, performed within the last three (3) years.  Include name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of references.  Also, provide a brief description of the work performed, locations/sites, contract number, total contract value, and period of performance.

<DESC><p>The US Department of Commerce/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The proposed source is APLICOR, INC of Boca Raton, FL.</p>
<p>The intended contract with Aplicor is for Application Support Services for the International Trade Administrations (ITA) Client Tracking System (CTS). The purpose of this system is to provide ITA with a centralized database and supporting application tools for managing all interactions (360 degree focus) with its customers. This Commercial-Of- the-Shelf (COTS) software package, hosted by Aplicor, contains several modules which have gone through significant customization in an effort to meet ITA's unique and dynamic business requirements. The CTS product is developed, licensed and owned by Aplicor. No other vendor currently licenses or provides Application Services support for the product as Aplicor holds full proprietary rights to the Aplicor software and all its modules.<br />Some examples of customizations completed to-date to meet ITA's business needs which are managed and maintained by Aplicor include:</p>
<p>&bull; Lotus Notes Synchronization: Provides the ability to synchronize ITA's existing Lotus Notes emails to specific activity associated with an organization, contact or case record within the CTS database. <br />&bull; Commercial Diplomacy Success and Export Successes: Provides the ability for end-users to log, track and report on actions and interactions taken on behalf of Commercial Service and Market Access and Compliance clients. <br />&bull; Application Tuning and Performance Relative to ITA's Environment:<br />Aplicor's certified and accredited (C&amp;A) installation of ITA's infrastructure components at a external hosting facility is a key to CTS's reliable and secured performance which supports an international user-base of 2,500+ personnel.<br />&bull; Application interfaces between CTS and internal ITA Legacy Applications (e.g. Emenu): Integration of the CTS application with various ITA legacy applications allows critical ITA data to be shared and validated in a timely manner.<br /><br />&bull; Customized Reporting: This functionality allows end-users to custom build and configure both batch reports and on-line queries.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Custom Business Rules/Workflow: Custom business rules with supporting electronic workflows (export successes and concurrence process for case management) have been created within the CTS application to meet ITA's unique and dynamic business requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Core Product Modules: These modules which are included in the base product and are exclusive to Aplicor include: Content Designer, Document Library, Marketing Management and Project Management Office.</p>

No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the products is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer within ten calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.

Contracting Activity:  The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity.<BR><BR>2.  Description of Action:  This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed price contract using R&D Fiscal Year 2008 funds.<BR><BR>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC) has the requirement to obtain premade water samples in 3ml, 5ml, and 1ml volumes that are utilized in multiple bioforensic assays.   <BR><BR>4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed contractor for this action is Invitrogen.  Invitrogen is the sole manufacturer who produces these products within an ISO: 9001 certified facility.  The NBFAC has identified these premade water samples critical to their bioforensic assays within their ISO 17025 scope of accreditation.  The Invitrogen water samples were identified as critical by multiple technical experts at the NBFAC as Invitrogen is able to provide data with their products that support the purity and quality of the premade water samples, no other supplier found during Market Research will provide such details.  It is imperative that the NBFAC obtains high quality data on the products they use throughout their assays as a requirement within the ISO 17025 to ensure the efficacy of the results they produce for their government customers.  <BR><BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  No efforts will be taken to obtain competition as Invitrogen is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these premade water samples produced under a high quality standard (ISO: 9001) as identified while performing Market Research.<BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Increasing competition is not possible at this time as Invitrogen is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these premade water samples produced under a high quality standard (ISO: 9001) as identified while performing Market Research.<BR><BR>8.  Market Research:  Market Research was performed by Ms. Crothers of the NBFAC in October 2008.  Ms. Crothers identified ThermoFisher Scientific, and Sigma Aldrich as other possible suppliers. Neither of these suppliers was willing to develop custom premade water samples at the volumes required by the NBFAC to perform their bioforensic assays.  Also, neither supplier performed the same quality testing that Invitrogen performs prior to release of their products.  The results from those quality tests are critical to the NBFAC to ensure they are utilizing high quality products throughout the performance of their bioforensic assays in order to adhere to the ISO 17025 standard and to ensure the efficacy of the results they produce for their government customers.<BR><BR>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have written to express interest in this requirement.  <BR><BR>10.	Other facts:  <BR>a.	Procurement history.  Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from the computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are expected:<BR><BR>i.	Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards:  These items were previously purchased from Invitrogen in June 2006 via a credit card at USAMRIID, a sole source contract was not previously developed.<BR>ii.	Competitive status of these actions.  This information is not available to requistioner, as these items were previously purchased via a credit card at USAMRIID.<BR>iii.	Authority previously used for less than full and open competition. This information is not available to requistioner, as these items were previously purchased via a credit card at USAMRIID.<BR>iv.	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.  No previous justification was written for the purchase of these premade water samples.<BR>v.	If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, detailed explanation of the change circumstances. This information is not available to requistioner.<BR>vi.	An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive urgent buys.  Not applicable.<BR>vii.	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes.  No previous justification was written for the purchase of these premade water samples.<BR>viii.	Acquisition data availability.  Due to the market research performed by Ms. Crothers which did not identify any other possible sources of these premade water samples except for those supplied by Invitrogen.  No statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition has been developed.<BR><BR>b.	Unusual compelling urgency.  Not applicable.<BR><BR>c.	Subcontracting competition:  Not applicable.<BR>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the development of 3DQuartz Phenolic compression pads, and material property test billets in support of theOrion (Crew Exploration Vehicle  CEV) Thermal Protection System (TPS) AdvancedDevelopment Project (ADP).  The TPS ADP was established to address risks associated withthe development of TPS for the CEV capable of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Lunar DirectReturn (LDR) missions.	TPS advanced development is being conducted to reduce or mitigatethese risks.  The CEV is a critical component in the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE),and will serve as the primary manned space vehicle to the International Space Station aswell as to the moon.  The CEV will also support the architecture employed for missions toMars.  The TPS heat shield provides essential thermal protection during CEV return toEarth.	The heat shield compressions pads serve as a load path between the Service Module(SM) and Command Module (CM) of the CEV.  The compression pads, being an integral part ofthe heat shield must also survive entry into the Earths atmosphere for both LEO and LDRmissions. Coupon samples representative of compression pad material will be used by NASA toevaluate physical, structural, environmental and thermal properties and performance. Following rigorous testing and analysis of these samples, NASA may exercise an option formanufacture of full scale compression pads.  See the attached Statement of Work (SOW) andHardware Requirements List (HRL) for quantities and specifications.  The compression padswill be integrated with the CEV heat shield architecture. At present, the CEV TPS ADP isstudying two material architectures for the Orion heat shield, PICA, the ablativematerial that protected the Stardust heatshield, and Avcoat, the ablative material thatwas used by Apollo. Either Avcoat or PICA will be selected as the material for the heatshield architecture in March, 2009 and the compression pad design needs to be compatiblewith the selected architecture.NASA intends to transfer responsibility for further development of the compression padsto the CEV Prime Contractor (Lockheed Martin) at the end of this contract and currently,CEV TPS ADP is working closely with the Prime on the heat shield design.  Because of theimportance of the CEV prime contractors current and future responsibilities, extensiveinteraction with the CEV Prime will be required during the performance of this contract.CEV development is managed by the CEV Project Office at the NASA Johnson Space Center inHouston, Texas.  The TPS ADP directly supports the CEV Project Office. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-27.The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 325211, andsize standard: 750 respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their sizestatus for this procurement.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Delivery will be as specified in the SOW and HRL.

<p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE <br />FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2, Content. <br /><br />1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action - Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division has a requirement to renew six annual software subscriptions for West Publishing Corporation's American Jurisprudence CD-Rom version. The American Jurisprudence software provides six BOP institutions various law publications for the inmate law libraries.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies and Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs - Inclusive of the Estimated Value - The BOP requires six annual software subscriptions for the American Jurisprudence. The software subscription will consist of six CD-Rom's which will allow one user per CD-Rom access to the law publications. The renewal of the American Jurisprudence software will provide inmates access to the law publications as required by BOP's Program Statement (P.S.) 1315.07.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the annual subscription is $32,961.60.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>5. Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP requires the use of the law publications at each of the six institutions. American Jurisprudence provides access to various law publications for the inmate law libraries. The BOP must provide inmates access to various law publications as stated in BOP's P.S. 1315.07. Without the renewal of the American Jurisprudence subscription, the BOP will not be supporting the above referenced Program Statement. The agency's need for the American Jurisprudence CD-Rom subscriptions can only be provided by one source. West Publishing Corporation owns the propriety rights to this software. The services required are not available from another source.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition - Market research was conducted to determine if any authorized resellers could provide the American Jurisprudence CD-Rom subscriptions, but the software is proprietary to West Publishing Corporation and they do not have any authorized resellers. Through market research, West Publishing Corporation is the only firm eligible to provide the required subscription, therefore, competition could not be obtained.</p>
<p>7. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination - A review of West Publishing Corporation's proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer. Based on market research, it was determined that the company's established pricing is the same for Government and Corporation subscribers. The price offered by West Publishing Corporation is considered fair and reasonable based on market research, historical data, and previously paid prices.</p>
<p>8. Market Survey - Market research was conducted to see if West Publishing Group had any authorized resellers that could offer the product that the BOP needs to fulfill this requirement. The result of the research conducted confirms that West Publishing Group is the only one vendor that can fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>9. Other Factors - The subscription service is required to maintain the American Jurisprudence CD-Rom license to enable inmates to conduct legal research in the inmate law libraries at the BOP's institutions. Not renewing this subscription would not adhere to the BOP's P.S. 1315.07, as this software is necessary to provide the inmates with various law publications.</p>
<p>10. List of Sources - West Publishing Group owns the proprietary rights to the American Jurisprudence subscription software.</p>
<p>11. Action to be Taken to Promote Future Competition - Not Applicable.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification - I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//s// Kristina Sullivan, Contract Specialist, National Acquisition Section</p>
<p>13. Requirements Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//s// Denise Lomax, BOP Librarian, Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division</p>
<p>14. Concurrence - I certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//s// Donald G. Sinsel, Senior Contract Specialist, National Acquisitions Section</p>

Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 66.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

"If requested by the deponent or a party before completion of the deposition, the deponent shall have 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which to review the transcript or recording and, if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement reciting such changes and the reasons given by the deponent for making them. The officer shall indicate in the certificate prescribed by subdivision (f)(1) whether any review was requested and, if so, shall append any changes made by the deponent during the period allowed."

The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:
 

	Policy development or implementation

	Higher-level management assignment

	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

	IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

	Assistance to policy development and implementation,

	Mid-level management assignments,

	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3	Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2.  As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category.  In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.
 
The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years.

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.  The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.  The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

 
	
4.7.4	Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.

The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractors prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff  The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance  Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officers Technical Representative).
o	Contract/Task Order number.
o	Total dollar value of the contract/order.  If performed as part of a team, provide the dollar value of your firms contribution.
o	Period of contract performance.
o	Description of work performed.	

1.2.3	Recording Method  The Contractor must clearly identify the contractors type of 			recording method and/or equipment that will be used for both grand jury and 			depositions.  Failure to provide this information could affect the contractors 			ability to receive a contract award. 

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractors client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendors work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendors submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSAs discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offerors total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendors price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

4.7 Security Requirements


4.7.1 Personnel Security

4.7.1.1 The USAO will process background security investigations for grand jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract.  Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to grand jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval.  If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to grand jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor's total loss of access approval for grand jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

4.7.1.2 The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract.  This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants.  No employee may be used on grand jury testimony until the Contractor has, for each individual, received in writing the approval of the USAOs. 

4.7.1.3 Should grand jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17.  In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies. 

4.7.1.4  In the event the USAOs is unable to obtain security approval to grand jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for grand jury court reporters.

4.7.2	Required Security Investigation

4.7.2.1 The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder.  The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:
 

	Policy development or implementation

	Higher-level management assignment

	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

	IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

	Assistance to policy development and implementation,

	Mid-level management assignments,

	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3	Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2.  As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category.  In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.
 
The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.  The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.  The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

 
	
4.7.4	Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:
o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o	Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o	The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o	Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 SPS will fund the security system required for this action.

4.7.4.3   End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.

4.7.4.4   The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5   If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5   Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2   When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 

4.7.5.5 Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractors prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff  The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance  Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officers Technical Representative).

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractors client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendors work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendors submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSAs discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offerors total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendors price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

ATTACHMENTS 

D.1 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement.  The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages).  These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval.  Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

<DESC>Amendment Number 1:  Clarification to ROV specifications

(1) LED lights are acceptable if of sufficient intensity, instead of halogen light. Additionally, EPA requires variable intensity of those lights.

(2) EPA requires a minimum of two lights on the ROV.

(3) The color video camera must be tilting; the black and white camera may be fixed.

(4) The maximum depth requirement is 300 m depth capability.

(5) Training will take place in Milwaukee, WI

(6) The ROV wrist rotation on the manipulator is required.  The manipulator arm must articulate via a 1) jaw and 2) a wrist, thus 2 functions.  The recovery line attachment would be something like a locking ring with line carried down in the manipulator. If your company cannot supply this, submit your commercial equivalent, and it will be evaluated.

(7) The ROV should have a 200 meter sonar, however if your company cannot supply this, submit your commercial equivalent, and it will be evaluated.

(8) Umbilical Length Clarification - EPA requires a maximum depth capability of 300 m.  Although we only specify a 150 m umbilical, we want the ability, in the future, to go to 300 m by only purchasing a new umbilical. 

(9) Scanning Sonar Clarification  EPA requires a scanning sonar (not side scan) with a range of 200 m.  Scanning Sonar means sonar that detects in an arc that includes the front and side of the path of the ROV.

<DESC>6. (Question) Proposal format - we could find no specific guidance regarding the format for the proposal - ie # of pages, # of references, resumes, etc.   If there is no prescribed format please advise or if there is please advise as well. (Answer)THERE IS NO REQUIRED FORMAT. A WORD DOCUMENT WITH A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSAL IS FINE. A RESUME IS NOT NECESSARY.

7. (Question) The EAL application, along with the associated systems HW/SW will be the 'System under Test' within the ARSC/ISD environment.   Our anticipated solution will also require a test system configuration to drive the transaction scripts that will simulate the workload for EAL/ALMIS.

<a href="mailto:Marsha.Harrington-Evans@va.gov">Contracting Officer's email</a>
<DESC>The following is the Government's response to vendor questions:1.	QUESTION:  The flat fee price proposal as stated allows for only one rate.  Would you consider a flat fee for each category of professional?  This would give the VA a much better return on each medical professional instead of a weighted average.ANSWER:  Yes.2.	QUESTION:  Is this model currently being used in other VISN zones?  If so, can you tell us where?ANSWER:  VISN 1.3.	QUESTION:  Although this solicitation is not set aside for small business, would teaming with a SDVO garner additional evaluation points?ANSWER:  No.4.	QUESTION:  Do you anticipate multiple awards for this solicitation?ANSWER:  Possibly.5.	QUESTION:  Can you provide an estimate of the mix of positions for VISN 6?ANSWER:  Primary group is physicians of various specialties; secondary group is probably OT/PT/DRT; the smallest group is nurses.6.	QUESTION:  Will the candidates have to complete the Physician application package prior to being approved by the VA or prior to being submitted to the MTF for consideration?ANSWER:  Yes, unless otherwise negotiated on an individual category basis.7.	QUESTION:  Will the VA be using its recruiting resources concurrently with the awardees efforts?  ANSWER:  Yes.8.	QUESTION:  Are any of the positions eligible under the HPSA guidelines?ANSWER:  VHA has sites located in HPSAs, but we use the same hiring and pay mechanisms throughout VA.  Market pay may be impacted by the shortage areas but, otherwise, benefits are the same.9.	QUESTION:  Are these positions all scheduled for one year or more, or are they short term?ANSWER:  Long term.  10.	QUESTION:  Is it too late to submit a interest in this BID?ANSWER:  No, the solicitation close date has been extended to December 29, 2008, 4:30 p.m. (local time).  An amendment has been issued.  11.	QUESTION:  Do you have incumbents performing any of the work envisioned by this RFP?   If so, would you please provide their name(s) and address(es)? ANSWER:  There is no Incumbent.12.	QUESTION:  Also, we are asking you to provide an extended bid response time for this complex RFP.  Two weeks during the holiday season does not seem to be a reasonable time to submit a proposal as broad and complex as this RFP.  ANSWER:  Please see the answer to Question 10 above.13.	QUESTION:  Due to the complexity of this Request for Proposal, will the VA consider extending the bid response date?ANSWER:  Please see the answer to Question 10 above.14.	QUESTION: Will the VISN consider a request for a time extension of two weeks for submission of the final proposal to allow adequate time to review all questions and responses?ANSWER:  Please see the answer to Question 10 above.15.	QUESTION: Given the diversity of medical skills needed will the VISN consider a breakout of skills, and recruiting pricing for A. physicians, B. nursing staff, C. allied health providers?ANSWER: Yes. 16.	QUESTION: If recruiting bonuses, i.e. sign-on incentives, are necessary will the VISN/VA pay for them or would they need to be included in "headhunter" fees?ANSWER: This contract is for identification of candidates.  The vendor will be paid based on the number of successful hires.  IF there are any recruiting bonuses, the VA will pay directly to the candidate.  Candidates who have paid "headhunter fees" to the company will not be accepted.17. QUESTION:   Will the VISN allow on-site visits for recruiting staff to properly assess facilities and staffing needs?ANSWER: Yes.18. QUESTION:  Should potential candidates be fully credentialled prior to submission to the VA?ANSWER:  Unsure what is meant by this question.  Candidates must have appropriate degrees, internships, citizenship, references, etc.  The requirements are listed in VA 5005.19. QUESTION:  What is the minimum time requirement a medical caregiver would have to commit to in becoming a VA employee?ANSWER:  At least a year.20. QUESTION:   Are there any unique recruiting benefits that the VA can offer to assist in sourcing activities?ANSWER:  Excellent retirement package and health insurance, and no overhead (such as malpractice costs).21. QUESTION:  If a staffing company has been in business for over 3 years, but its healthcare practice is only 1 year old, can we bid?	ANSWER:  No.22.	QUESTION:  Is the VA looking for a vendor with the capabilities to deliver all needs on an exclusive basis?  ANSWER:  No, not all our needs and not on an exclusive basis.  Our needs are for finding candidates in very hard to fill specialties, such as specialty physicians, OT/PT/DRTs.  These are not all recruitment needs, but will be on intermittent basis and perhaps only one or two in a given specialty at a specific time. We will also be conducting internal recruitment for the positions, but if we ask a headhunter to assist, that means we couldn't find someone through our internal processes.    23.	QUESTION:  Does the VA have any idea of the distribution of the positions needed by the regional centers?  ANSWER:  No, we don't have an exact distribution.
