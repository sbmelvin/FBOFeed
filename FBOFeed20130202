<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<a href="mailto:shavon.baker@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/COMMENTS (RFI) SYNOPSIS ONLY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RFI SYNOPSIS IS TO SEEK INFORMATION/COMMENT REGARDING THE PROCUREMENT OF A DEPLOYABLE 120 LPM OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR FOR THE U.S. ARMY MEDICAL MATERIEL AGENCY (USAMMA), FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND.  <br>    <br>  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TITLE: USAMMA 120 LPM OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR  <br>    <br>  DISCLAIMER:   <br>  The attached draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued solely for market research, information, and planning purposes only. This Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quotation.  <br>    <br>  Ideas contained herein may change significantly during the requirement's ongoing program design, consultation, and approval process. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  <br>    <br>  This RFI does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  Availability of any formal solicitation resulting from this RFI, if a solicitation is released,  will be synopysized separately on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fbo.gov).  <br>     <br>  PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.  <br>    <br>  Submitting entities should review FAR 3.104 and FAR subpart 24.2 which sets forth the Government's obligations to protect information submitted in response to this RFI.  <br>    <br>  Pursuant to FAR 15.201(f), information to be provided by the Government in a public forum to a potential respondent in response to such respondent's request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential Respondent's confidential business strategy, and is protected under FAR 3.104 or FAR subpart 24.2. (Nonetheless, Respondents should properly mark their responses if the information is confidential).  <br>     <br>  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is, 339999, All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 500 employees. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to the NAICS code.   <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND: The results of the Army's prior solicitation for a deployable 120LPM Oxygen Concentrator were less than satisfactory.  From this procurement, the testing of demonstration units in field conditions did not meet the Army's requirements. These systems were unsatisfactory in terms of reliability, availability and maintainability.  The Army would like industry to review the requirements included in this draft RFP and submit recommendations focused on:  <br>  1. Improvements to sustainability and maintainability of these systems.   <br>  2. The Army is interested in new technologies, new designs, and/or changes to configuration, employment, training, maintenance or other factors that would improve the overall reliability and sustainability of these systems.   <br>  3. The Army will review all comments and consider modifications to its requirements, based on industry input, before posting any subsequent RFP.   <br>  4. The Army is also interested in lead times for manufacture of improved systems and industries willingness to submit test articles in response to future RFP submissions.  <br>  5. Are there any areas where interested parties believe a potential risk exists or will present itself by fulfilling the terms of the draft RFP?  <br>  6. Is there any area within the draft RFP where interested parties believe the Government has failed to adequately set forth the stated requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner?  <br>  7. Is there any area within the draft RFP that has an overall positive and/or negative impact on the process of evaluating contractor performance (i.e. performance objectives, evaluation process, etc.)?  <br>  8. Is there any area within the draft RFP that appears unduly burdensome to either the Government or the Contractor towards the goal of achieving superior contractor performance?  <br>    <br>  RESPONSE INFORMATION: Responses to this draft RFP are strictly voluntary. Interested parties shall provide all feedback in writing no later than 2:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time), on February 28, 2013. Interested Parties may e-mail them to joy.d.kamara@us.army.mil or mail them to the following address:   <br>    <br>  US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, ATTN: MCMR-AAA, 820 Chandler Street,  <br>  Frederick, MD 21702-5014  <br>    <br>  Point of Contact:  <br>  Joy D.
