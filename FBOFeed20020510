<DESC>The proposed acquisition is listed as a full and open competition requirement. The NAICS Code is 541611. Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. The offeror shall provide technical assistance to Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Lead Agencies at the State level on the use of CCDF funds to support out-of-school time programs both directly and through coordination with other government programs and other sectors.  More specifically, the project will: Identify ways that all 50 States and communities are using CCDF subsidy and quality dollars to support out-of-school time programs, and share these practices and approaches with other States; Identify administrative and implementation issues related to CCDF investments in out-of-school time programs, and provide information and context (about barriers, problems, opportunities) as well as practical tools that will help CCDF administrators make decisions; Identify other major programs and sectors that are potential partners for CCDF in supporting out-of-school time programs, and identify models, strategies and tools for coordination with other programs and sectors in support of out-of-school time programs. THE TASKS UNDER THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL INCLUDE: Identifying and tracking CCDF investments in out-of-school time programs in all 50 States--including subsidy policies, licensing practices, and quality initiatives at the State and local levels.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   U.S. EPA intends to award this procurement on a sole source basis- no set aside. Project Office: National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Project Description:  This procurement is for DNA extraction, DNA quantification, whole genome amplification,  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using Taqman Assays and the sensitive and accurate Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) genetic analysis of DNA from two novel human sample types: nail and cheek (buccal) cells. This procurement  requires high-throughput genotyping to obtain accurate and reproducible results with as little as 1-3 nanograms of genomic DNA.  It is critical that if the biological sample is shown to be sample limited, that whole genome amplification can be performed. In effect, the proposed vendor shall "make"  DNA from regions that are intact along the DNA strand. Justification for sole source:  It has been shown that different laboratories can yield different results. In addition, the possibility of different results would result in negative peer reviews. Because of the research's high priority and the  associated literature scrutiny, no other vendor is acceptable. It is essential for all four procedures be performed by the same laboratory to insure identical handling, storage and sample preparation.  Equally important is our need to compare our data with data from the National Center for  Toxicological Research, which was previously obtained by the sole source for this procurement. This data capability will provide the EPA with the direct ability to compare the distribution of our genetic analyses with those generated in the identical manner with identical error rates, sample  preparation storage and SNP and MALDI-TOF analyses.  This posting is not a Request for Quotation. However, any business whom wishes to challenge the sole source basis, may do so. Inquires should be submitted by fax to Greg Feingold at (919) 541-1075 or email feingold.greg@epa.gov. Telephone  inquires will not be honored. Any challenge to the sole source basis must be received by 3:00 PM on the closing date of the synopsis.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate, AFRL/PR-West, Edwards AFB, CA is soliciting technical/management and cost proposals for projects supporting the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program(IHPRPT) under Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) 02-02-PKT titled IHPRPT VIII.  Responses to this solicitation are sought to develop an advanced technology base for rocket propulsion concepts and components aimed at supporting the IHPRPT program.  The IHPRPT program is the DoD/NASA/Industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  Capability infers the full spectrum of technological needs, such as performance, affordability, operability, reliability, and maintainability.  The IHPRPT program is structured in four phases to achieve pre-determined measurable increases in all rocket technology capabilities.  Phases I, II, and III specify technology demonstrations for each phase by the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 respectively.  The fourth phase demonstration date, for the Strategic Sustainment Technology efforts is 2004.  The IHPRPT program is organized along three mission application areas: Boost/Orbit Transfer Propulsion, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  Within each of the mission application areas, there are five identical technology areas that specify the particular technologies being advanced to meet the goals of IHPRPT.  The five Technology Areas include Propellants, Propellant Management Devices, Combustion and Energy Conversion Devices, and Technology Demonstrators.  The Strategic Sustainment Technology area is a sixth technology area, but exists under the boost/orbit transfer propulsion and the tactical mission application areas only.  A seventh area, entitled Materials, supports the other 6 technology areas.  Proposals are being solicited in the following technology area in this PRDA: Propellants Area, Solids - Topic:  Energetic Propellant Formulation Characterization. This is an unrestricted solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) applicable to this acquisition is 541710 with 1000 employees.  Small businesses are encouraged to propose on this solicitation.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA and model contract.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has a requirement for a WindTracer Pulsed Coherent Doppler Wake Turbulence Lidar.  This compact, mobile, electro-optical, scanning, laser based system will be used in the detection, tracking, and characterization of aircraft wake vortices.  The system has a wake detection range of three kilometers and can scan for wakes in multiple planes in order to establish their axial coherence.  The system provides measurement of the range, height, and strength of the scanned aircraft wakes through backscatter of the laser energy from particulates and aerosols trapped within the wake.  The Doppler shifting capability, tha t is, detection of velocity variations within the wake structure forms the basis of the system’s ability to provide wake strength measurements.  The processing wake vortex algorithm processes the signals generated by the detection of the backscattered laser signals to produce the wake characteristics and location.  The hardware system comprises of a transceiver unit, scanner unit, heat exchange/power converter unit, controller unit, signal processor unit, and additional electronics and support equipment.  Additional external hardware elements include a second graphical user interface (GUI) computer that provides the user with the ability to control the system and display the computed data products from a remote location.  Anticipated period of performance is eight (8) months.  The Volpe Ce nter intends to award a sole source contract to CLR Photonics, Lafayette, Colorado.  A market survey was conducted in March 2002, and the results of the survey support our determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items, Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Part 15 – Contracting by Negotiation.  This proposed action is for services or supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR subpart 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources may respond to this synopsis and responses will be fully considered by the Volpe Center.  Interested fir ms are requested to submit two (2) copies of descriptive documentation in sufficient detail, do not include any pricing information, to allow an evaluation of a bonafide capability to satisfy the Government requirements within fifteen (15) calendar days of publication of this notice.  Please send documentation to Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Attn:  Kathleen M. Foley, DTS-853, 55 Broadway, Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA  02142-1093.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) announces the availability of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. DAAD19-02-R-0005 for Experimental and Theoretical Development of Quantum Computers dated May 2002.  The BAA solicits research proposals for one to three-y ear performance periods for two categories related to quantum computing:  (1) Quantum Computing and (2) Quantum Algorithm.  “Quantum Computing” proposals are specifically for both experimental and theoretical studies of potential physical embodiments of qu antum logic and for more basic (usually, but not necessarily, theoretical) studies in the related fields of quantum error correction and control, quantum decoherence and entanglement.   The experimental implementation studies must develop proof-of-concept demonstrations.  A minimum objective is the demonstration, at the conclusion of a three-year project, of several entangling operations on at least three qubits.  Proposals for theoretical and other basic studies should be smaller in scope, but like the lar ger experimental qubit implementation proposals, should make very clear how the proposed work will enhance understanding of quantum computation and, therefore, facilitate the eventual development of practical quantum computers.   “Quantum Algorithm” propos als primarily should develop new quantum computing algorithms but may also consider issues of quantum computational complexity and computability.   Proposals should be to devise specific quantum algorithms to solve mathematically and computationally hard p roblems from such diverse fields as algebra, number theory, geometry, analysis, optimization, graph theory, differential equations, combinatorics, topology, and logic.  Also of interest are physically inspired problems that provide new insight into quantum  algorithms and computation for mathematics.   The BAA solicitation contains additional information along with instructions for white paper and proposal preparation and submission.  Informal white papers must be received at ARO by July 1, 2002.  White pape rs are not required prior to proposal submission but are strongly encouraged.  Proposals must be received at ARO by October 8, 2002.  Electronic submission of white papers (if submitted) and proposals is required.   This BAA may be found on ARO’s website a t http://www.aro.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for VARIOUS XKD SPARE PARTS FOR TWO EXISTING XKD MODEL 8000 DISPLAY UNITS. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from XKD CORPORATION who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The replacement parts are required to be on hand to minimize the impact of potential failure of the custom designed XKD Video Monitors. The XKD Corp. modified the components to make the monitors' specifications conform to the requirements dictated by NASA's simulation hardware and it would take substantial time and money for another company to duplicate these components. Those costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (Phone Calls are not accepted)to Ms. Terry Cobb, NASA/LaRC, M/S 126, Hampton, VA 23681; fax number 757-864-6966, not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on May 20, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Synopsis <P> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to acquire by single source, software development services for Implementation of the scenario generator "Phase II" of the design developed by Gallium Software Inc., under Phase I which was for design of a scenario editor for the Human Factors Research Division (AAM-500) Air Traffic Control Advanced Research Simulator (ATCARS)  This requirement is a follow-on to that initial development phase of the ATCARS simulator system development.  Due to funding limitations, the implementation phase (current requirement) could not be funded with initial contract.  Funding is now available to complete the implementation phase.  Gallium has proprietary rights to system software specifications and the FAA does not have the information necessary for a competitive acquisition.  Competition will be limited to Gallium Software , Inc., 303 Moodie Drive, Suite 400 Nepean, Ontario K2H9R4000, Canada.  Gallium has been identified as the only source!  that is uniquely qualified to perform the work due to their previous knowledge and experience with this particular FAA system.  Gallium has the knowledge of the system, its requirements, FAA training development processes and requirements, and therefore does not require the lead time to be brought up to speed required of other contractors.  No other contractor has this unique knowledge or experience necessary to complete in time to support the operational deployment of the ATCARS.  Restricting competition on this procurement to this contractor mitigates risks to both the quality and on-time completion of these important product and is in the best interest of the FAA and the safety of the flying public.  If you have any questions, please contact:  Brent D. Foreman, Contracting Officer, (405) 954-7894, (405) 954-3030 (facsimile). <P>

<ARCHDATE>06292002
<CONTACT>Kathy Thomas, 414-486-2960
<DESC>This announcement is “For Planning Purposes Only.”   <P> In April 1996, Administrator Garvey announced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would begin a comprehensive review and redesign of the United States airspace.  Since that time, the nine FAA regions have worked toward developing an airspace structure and concomitant air traffic control procedures that will enhance safety; balance pilot/controller workload; increase efficiency for our customers, the flying public; and provide optimal environmental benefits for citizens who underlie the airspace structure.  While each of the nine regions are responsible for developing an airspace structure and air traffic control procedures within their delegated portion of the national airspace, all regions are responsible for ensuring that their new airspace design/procedures coincide with the airspace/procedures developed by abutting regions.  Thus far, the Eastern Region has made the most progress in this endeavor.  Parts of the Great Lakes Region abut Eastern Region as well as!  Canadian airspace.  It is expected that the Eastern Region will announce their New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia airspace redesign plan in the near future.  It will be necessary for the Great Lakes Region to support their redesign and could result in airspace/procedures changes within the Great Lakes airspace, including enroute, terminal, and special use airspace. <P>  On June 29, 2001, the City of Chicago announced a future long-range concept for O’Hare Airport.  The concept includes reconfiguration of the existing seven active runways, with the addition of one runway and the relocation of three of the current runways in which six runways would be oriented in an east/west direction and other runways would be closed.  At the present time, the FAA is working with the City of Chicago toward preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) to examine the environmental effects of the concept plan. <P> Construction of new runways at O’Hare Airport could require that airspace/procedural changes be made in the Chicago area airspace to accommodate them.  This may be true for the final construction design as well as interim construction phases as present day runways are closed and new runways are built.  As such, the Chicago airspace area may undergo several changes as construction proceeds along its various phases.  In turn, the changes to the Chicago area airspace may affect National Airspace Redesign efforts for both the Great Lakes and Eastern Regions. <P> The FAA is seeking information from qualified firms interested in assisting them to prepare a technical assessment document which will; 1) detail the airspace/procedures necessary for the Chicago area airspace in support of the City of Chicago’s final runway construction plan, as well as any interim airspace/procedures which may be necessary during the various construction phases; 2) examine if the airspace/procedures necessary for the city’s runway construction project are operationally compatible with the changes the National Airspace Redesign team has planned for the Great Lakes Region; 3) examine if the airspace/procedures in the Great Lakes integrated design plan are compatible with the formal Eastern Region New York/New Jersey/ Philadelphia redesign; and 4) if not compatible, detail how to make them compatible.  The firm selected for these tasks will also be responsible for assisting the FAA in deciding the best means by which to examine the various operational changes!  from an environmental perspective.  This may include identification of the documentation (i.e., EA, EIS) necessary to disclose the environmental effects of the various airspace/procedural projects, devising a phased approach to examine the environmental effects of the various project components on a cumulative basis, and devising a timeline for the environmental process.  <P> The selected firm must be thoroughly familiar with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Provisions of NEPA, and applicable state environmental laws.  The firm must also have knowledge of airport development, noise abatement initiatives for project area airports, and planning activities at project area airports.   <P> Interested firms should submit the following information: 1) a description of the firm listing the locations of major offices; 2) professionals on staff with actual experience evaluating airspace/air traffic control procedures from an operational and environmental perspective; 3)  Evidence that professionals on staff have experience with enroute, terminal, and special use airspace projects; 4) a description of the environmental projects underway or completed by the firm which have involved primarily airspace/air traffic control procedures and/or major airports; 5) evidence that staff professionals are familiar with operational and environmental evaluation of several airports simultaneously, or large airspace areas; and 6) evidence that staff professionals have experience with airport/airspace modeling and correlation of airport/airspace modeling with noise modeling.       <P> At a minimum, interested firms should provide the following information: client’s name, title, address, telephone number; name of FAA or other individual who supervised the firm’s work for each project; airport name and/or location and size of the airspace area for each project; date(s) of local, state, or federal approvals; and a statement of any unique features of the studies.  The FAA reserves the right to contact any of the named individuals to determine performance on the listed projects.  After screening this information for qualified candidates, the Contracting Officer shall submit to those candidates the full scope of work for the project.  The FAA may or may not use any or all the information obtained through this notice. <P> It is important to note that successful completion of the work associated with this announcement could result in a contract for additional environmental work (i.e., assisting the FAA in preparing an EA, EIS) with regard to the aforementioned airspace/air traffic procedure projects.  <P> Information should be sent to the following mailing address: Federal Aviation Administration Attn: Kathy Thomas 4915 South Howell Avenue, 4th Floor Milwaukee, WI  53207 <P> Telephone:  414-486-2960 Fax:  414-486-2921 <P>

<DESC>(9) Data Requirements:  Electronic data submittal is encouraged whenever feasible and cost-effective for the program.  The following data submittals are expected:  (a) Monthly status reports, including technical progress, programmatic issues, schedule, and appropriate disclosure of actual cost and labor expenditures (DI-MGMT-80368).  Each status report shall specifically address any patents or inventions identified and/or pending, as well as any proprietary issues.  Contractor-format Performance and Cost Report (DI-FNCL-80912), Contract Funds Status Report (DI-MGMT-81468), and Contract Work Breakdown Structure (DI-MGMT-81334) are required during both the Basic Award and any Option period of this program.  Copies of monthly billing vouchers submitted to the Government, as well as monthly updates regarding payments received from the Government are also required during the 34-month program.  (b) Computer models with documentation of the fuze sensor used in the launch to burst point simulation.  (c) A final software version of the launch to burst point simulation, including burst point control algorithms with documentation on performing setup and production runs with the software (DI-MCCR-80700).  (d) All analysis and technical data (DI-GDRQ-80567A).  (e) Development Specifications (DI-IPSC-81432A), draft product performance specifications, design drawings associated with the critical components and subsystems and their test fixtures, and final integrated systems level drawings (DI-SESS-81002B).  (f) Test plan(s) and test reports for all significant testing (DI-NDTI-80566).  (g) Interim technical reports (DI-MISC-80711A) submitted upon completion of the Basic Award and any Option phase, or as necessary to facilitate timely approval of test clearance and safety documentation.  (h) Final technical report, Unit Production Cost Estimates, Affordability Report, and a technology transfer report at the end of the program (DI-MISC-80711A).  The final report, which will be published in Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), must document the entire effort and must include relevant data and results from other technical data that would not otherwise be published.  The final report must be delivered to the Government in electronic form (Microsoft Word 2000 format or compatible).  (i) A record [e.g., agenda (DI-ADMN-81249A), presentation materials (DI-ADMN-81373), minutes and tracking of associated action items (DI-ADMN-81250A)] and number of required meetings.  (j) Videos and/or photos of component testing and computer simulations (DI-MISC-80738, DI-MISC-80192).  The contractor may propose additional elements or submittal of combined elements or Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) as appropriate for the proposed program.   (10) Meetings and Reviews:  The contractor will be expected to host and conduct various meetings throughout the program, including but not limited to a kickoff Program Review at the beginning of each identified phase.  The Government anticipates the following program meetings and reviews:  Kickoff within three weeks of contract start date at offeror's facilities; quarterly Technical Interchange Meetings that alternate between the offeror's facilities and Eglin AFB; and a Final Program review at completion at Government facilities at Eglin AFB, FL.  Additional Program Reviews will be held at times coinciding with key program milestones or decision points, as deemed appropriate by the contractor.  The contractor may propose to conduct or participate in other meetings with subcontractors, Government agencies, or third parties, as deemed appropriate to the program.  (11) Proprietary Items: The Government prefers the proposed FAST designs include no parts, materials, or software that are proprietary.  It is the offeror's responsibility to identify any proprietary materials, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime contractor or subcontractors in the performance of this program and to address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to the FAST hardware and software design and fabricated fuze sensor systems.  (12) Security Requirements:  Portions of this program will be classified up to the SECRET/NOFORN level.  Emissions Security (EMSEC) requirements will apply.  Generation of classified material for this solicitation is authorized only on equipment approved for classified processing by Air Force EMSEC authorities.  The Fuzes and Fuze Component Technology (20 October, 2000) and DSU-33 Proximity Sensors (21 August, 2001) Security Classification Guides (SCGs) shall be used as guidance in determining the classification of the offeror's proposal submitted in response to this PRDA.  (Note:  Potential offeror's should forward their request for copies of the referenced SCGs to the Government in strict accordance with the requirements of Section F(2) of this PRDA.)  (13) Clarifications from Pre-Solicitation One-on-One Meetings:  a.  PRDA ANNEX - An annex to this PRDA, in the form of a CD, is available to provide pertinent information requested during the Pre-Solicitation Conference and One-on-One Meetings.  Potential Offeror's may receive a CD by request only, and only if said company has a valid export control license (DDFORM 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement).  Technical Points of Contract (POCs) for this request are listed in section F(2).   Included in this package are:  6.2 FAST Program Reviews (Technical Data), NDIA 2001 Fuze Conference Paper, JDAM ORD, DSU-33 Technical Data Package (TDP), Foliage Penetration Technical Report Library List, Pre-Solicitation Conference Charts, and Environmental Conditions for Brassboard Tests.   b.  Battlefield Obscurants and Weather - Proposed fuze sensor concepts need to address Battlefield Obscurants and Weather effects, both in the basic design and the launch-to-burst point simulation.  The DOD source for Battlefield Obscurant and Weather effect data and models is the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) in Charlottesville, VA.  Points of contact at NGIC are as follows:  Jan Breeden, (434) 980-7870; Nicole Sweitzer, (434) 980-7243; and Diane Shriver (434) 980-7870.  c.  Scene Description - Battlefield Scenes of interest include fixed, stationary, point, and area targets that may be found revetted, in the open or in light-to-heavy foliage.  The target scenes may be located worldwide from 0 to 66.5 degrees latitude North and South.  Battlefield Scenes will be located in natural terrain; therefore, targets in urban environments will not be considered as part of this effort.  d.  Environmental Conditions - The brassboard field test units, nose and tail mounted, should, as a minimum, be designed for field-testing outdoors in fair weather conditions (no rain, light wind, etc.).  The brassboard nose mounted demo test units should be designed using best Industry practice to be weatherproof, survive external jet aircraft captive carry, and to survive/operate in realistic temperature/altitude demo test conditions (room ambient to minus 40 degrees C, 40,000 ft).  We recommend using appropriate portions of Mil Std 331, Mil Std 810, and the DSU 33 TDP as guides in these areas.  e.  Adverse Weather - Operation in Adverse Weather should address the proposed concept's ability to work in realistic delivery conditions for an inertial navigation systems/global positioning system (INS/GPS) guided weapon.  These include rain rates up to 25 mm/hour and water aerosols down to 15 meters visibility at the target site.  Visibility is defined as the distance at which one-way energy path loss for visible wavelengths is 97 percent.  Actual sensor performance will be dependent on the operating wavelength of the proposed concept and should be addressed.  f.  Cost-Sharing Proposals-Do not use.  Proposals offering to share costs may not be considered for award.  C--ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  (1) Anticipated Period of Performance: 34 months total, consisting of a 10-month Basic Award followed by a 24-month, Three Part Option (discussed in PRDA section B(5).  (2) The Government expects to award a single, cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract for the Basic Award (estimated award date of 12 Sep 02), which will provide for the Three Part Option.  (3) The Government estimates contract funding of approximately $5.4 Million.  Funding breakout is:  FY02: $200K; FY03: $2M; FY04: $2.3M; FY05: $900K.  This funding profile is an estimate only and is not a promise of funding, as all funding is subject to changes/availability and Government discretion.  (4) Government-Furnished Property/Equipment/Information (GFX):  It is the offeror's responsibility to identify items to be used, whether contractor- or Government-owned/furnished.  The Government will assist in providing GFX as appropriate and available.  GFX items previously identified at the Pre-Solicitation Conference, plus items added to the list as possible GFX are:  three Full-Up, Live DSU-33B/Bs, one Inert DSU-33/D1 for demonstration, Mk-82 sized Conceptual Tail Cone Design, Fuze Experimentation Facility, VisSim/MSTARS (Large and Small Bomb Flyout 6-DOF; small cost associated with licensing if desired), PC Irma (RF and Optical) scene generation tool w/faceted scenes of Range A-22 background, Range A-22 surveyed test areas and dynamic cable testing capability (crane rental is a contractor-cost item), PRIMES Anechoic Chamber (contractor-cost item).  D--PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  (1) General:  See Section B..(13)f. above.  Proposals submitted in response to this announcement must bear appropriate classification markings, and include a technical and a cost proposal, submitted in separate volumes.  Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal addressing the program, and Volume 2 (which must be UNCLASSIFIED) should address the price and cost details of the proposal for the program.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notices prescribed in FAR Provision 52.215-1(e), "Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition" to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals.  Additional proposal questions should be directed to both of the contracting points of contact listed in Section F(1).   (2) Technical Proposal: The Volume 1 technical proposal shall include, as a minimum: a Statement Of Work (SOW) suitable for contract incorporation; the offeror's technical approach for the entire program; risk management procedures to be applied to the program; identification of key personnel, resources, and critical subcontractors; hardware and data deliverables; a proposed program schedule including deliveries for the entire program; and a summary of relevant past (i.e., within last 3 years) and present performance of the proposing corporate division only, including reference points of contact and current phone numbers.  In his technical proposal the offeror shall propose and elaborate upon the two specific FAST Baseline, Point of Departure Designs.  The offeror must provide sufficient technical discussion and technical detail to establish the soundness of the proposed approach; provide an adequate basis for assessing program technical cost and schedule risk; and form a sound basis for the cost proposed in Volume 2.  To that end, the proposal shall address all aspects of the Baseline Design of both nose and tail mount configurations.  The proposal shall also identify and discuss the suitability of the various modeling and analysis tools that the contractor proposes to use during the FAST sensor program to satisfy the requirements and goals.  Proposals failing to provide adequate technical detail and discussion will be considered technically unresponsive to this PRDA.  The technical proposal shall also include an abbreviated overall test plan for both configurations.  (3) Cost Proposal:  Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The Volume 2 cost proposal must include as a minimum:  a cost element summary including direct labor, materials, subcontracted and/or consultant effort, overheads, travel, G&A, COM, fee, etc., and the associated percentage rates, for (a) the entire program, (b) the basic contract only, and (c) each of the Three Parts of the Option.  Also provide a legend that annotates what items rates are applied, and include a man-hour breakdown by task with labor categories and labor rates specified, and an expenditure schedule for the entire program.  The Three Part Option shall be proposed as a contract line item for each Part identified including field test and tactical units from both nose and tail mount designs respectively.  It is anticipated that a significant amount of the work performed under the FAST sensors contract will be classified.  Therefore, consider and reflect in the proposal the cost impact that security will have on all aspects of the proposed effort.  Generate/obtain and include in Volume 2 the cost of GFX (some of which has been identified in section C(4), and unless noted in that section, is cost-free, meaning such costs will not be counted when assessing whether or not the offeror?s proposal is in compliance with the estimated $5.4M contract limit), and all costs incurred by the Government that are associated with providing the equipment, facilities, and support necessary to meet the contractor's testing requirements.  All proposed costs should be presented in then-year-dollars.  (4)  Page Limits/Number and Types of Copies/Required Software/Authorization:  Volume 1 should be limited to a total of 60 pages, excluding the Statement of Work (SOW).   Resumes, charts, figures, tables, etc. are included in the 60-page limit.  Pages in excess of the specified 60 pages will be removed before being provided to the evaluation team.  The SOW should be limited to 5 pages, and tasks should be suitably detailed for incorporation into the contract.  Cost proposals have no page limit; however, the goal is not-to-exceed 20 pages.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 12-point type, or 12-pitch.  Both Technical and Cost proposals shall be submitted in an original and 6 paper copies each, and one additional copy on disk (in Microsoft Office 2000 format or compatible).  Note:  ZIP disks and CD's are acceptable.  The Government intends to work proposals and awards through electronic means.  Submission of a proposal constitutes an offeror's authorization for the Government to make limited reproduction and dissemination of the proposal within Government Agencies for funding consideration purposes.   (5) Preparation Costs:  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise obligate the Government.   E?BASIS FOR AWARD:  The Government intends to evaluate proposals received in response to this PRDA, and select a proposal on the basis of the best value potential for the entire program to the Government.  However, the Government reserves the right to award one, or no, contracts.  Further, the Government intends to award without opening discussions, if possible.  The awardee, if a large business, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 prior to award; however, communications related to this are not considered "discussions".  Technical and Cost Proposals will be evaluated as received using only the following criteria, and results of the technical evaluation will be considered more important than cost.  However, cost is considered a substantial factor.  The Technical evaluation factors, to be applied to Program Technical Requirements and Goals stated in PRDA Section B(4), are listed in the following decreasing order of importance:  (1) Offeror's Soundness of Technical Approach & Proposed SOW satisfy the Program Technical Requirements and Goals through (a) a Baseline, Point of Departure Design for both the Nose and Tail Mount Configurations; and (b) Provide an Integrated Solution with appropriate level of Maturity; (2) Offeror's Understanding of the Technical Effort; and (3) Offeror's relevant past and present performance.  The Cost Evaluation, of both the Basic and the Option, will be evaluated for (1) reasonableness and (2) realism, which are of equal importance.  Reasonableness is evaluated based upon price analysis conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1, and will also include an assessment of the contractor's methodology and assumptions to determine that they reflect sound business sense.  Cost analysis will also be conducted to determine realism in accordance with FAR 15.404-1.  Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  F--POINTS OF CONTACT: (1)  Contracting and Cost:  Address all questions to both:  Martin F. Kradlak, Contracting Officer, (850)882-4294 ext. 3402, and S.

The superstructure is supported on 179 vertical timber piles and 23 batter piles, each of 12-inch diameter.  Additionally, 55 fender piles occupy the perimeter of the pier.  The pier mooring hardware consists of eight cleats and five bitts.  Electrical panels, lights, and outlets at the pier have been removed.  The utility conduits have been abandoned but are still attached to the underside of the pier.  The Contractor will furnish all personnel, equipment, and material necessary to complete mobilization, pier demolition, and debris disposal and obtain the appropriate permits for this project.  Environmental concerns require the piles to be cut off at a point approximately one foot above the existing river bottom using a hydraulic cutter.  Disturbance of the bottom sediments must be kept at an absolute minimum, as such diver-operated equipment will not be allowed.  The Contractor will be required to deploy a turbidity curtain around the immediate work area and that extends vertically in the water column to make full contact with the river bottom.  Work must be done in a manner that minimizes disruption to production schedule.  This is a firm fixed price construction contract.  The estimated cost range is between $250,000.00 - $300,000.00.  Performance should start 14 days after contract award.  All responsible offerors, received on time, shall be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be posted at the following Internet address http://esolnavfac.navy.mil on or about 17 May 2002.  In accordance with FAR 5.102 (a)(7), this solicitation will only be available electronically.  The apparent successful offeror must be register in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Award will not be made until this requirement is met.  Offerors not registered in the CCR are highly encouraged to do so by calling 1-888-227-2424, via the Internet at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil.

<ARCHDATE>07102002
<CONTACT>Amy Wright, (202) 493-0039
<DESC>The TAC2 procurement will consist of two (2) Screening Information Requests.  The TAC2 SIR1 was initially released on December 11, 2001 with Pre-qualification statements due from interested companies on January 11, 2002.   However, the TAC2 procurement was temporarily suspended in February 2002, due to a pending FAA re-organization. The TAC2 procurement has since recommenced, with the anticipated addition of Free Flight Program support requirements. The AUATAC period of performance, originally planned to end on December 31, 2002, is being extended for 6 months under the Option to Extend Services clause in the AUATAC contract, until June 30, 2003.  This will allow the FAA time to conduct a full competition for TAC2.  Accordingly, the FAA is opening SIR1 to any interested company that did not previously submit a Qualification Statement on the TAC2 requirement, prior to the addition of Free Flight support.  Interested companies are required to notify the Contracting Offic! er, Amy Wright, of their intent to submit a Qualification Statement by 4:00p.m. E.D.T., May 17, 2002.  The Qualification Statement and associated SIR1 submissions are due June 10, 2002.  Companies who have already submitted Qualification Statements in response to the December 11, 2001 SIR1 release do not need to resubmit. <P> SIR1 establishes the prequalification requirements and submission instructions. SIR2, scheduled to be released in July 2002, will consist of the Request for Offer (RFO) from those companies successfully qualifying as a result of SIR1. The TAC2 Procurement internet site at                    http://www.faa.gov/aua/tac2 contains the SIR1 and additional information regarding the TAC2 procurement, including the TAC2 small business goals and the responses to industry questions and comments received to date. Companies interested in the TAC2 procurement are encouraged to check the TAC2 Procurement Internet Site frequently for information relating to the procurement. <P> Companies are reminded that TAC2 requires participation in the Mentor-Protégé program.  Offerors will be required to be an approved Mentor by the FAA's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), ARA-5. The FAA web site at http://www.faa.gov/sbo contains information on how to become an approved mentor.  <P> Revised Milestones for the TAC2 procurement are:  <P> Nov 2001 - Issue Draft Statement of Work;  Dec 2001 - Issue Prequalification SIR (SIR1);  Jan 2002 - Qualification Statements & Mentor Approval Due;  May 2002 - Reopen SIR1 (addition of Free Flight requirements); Jun 2002 - Additional Qualification Statements & Mentor Approval Due; Jun  2002 - Down Selection Notification to Contractors;  Jul 2002 - Issue Request for Offer to Selected Vendors (SIR2); Sept 2002 - Receipt of Proposals;  Mar 2003 - Contract Award <P>

<DESC>System Definition: <P> The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center has a requirement to implement a Work Order System.  This system will follow work requests from time of entry through completion of related work assignments. The system will have the ability to identify multiple projects and/or entity for one request.  Each project and/or entity will have the ability to capture information by tasks in a cascading effect. The system will have the ability to electronically log and track work requests, categorize work requests, attach change requests to prior initial requests, identify and track deviations of work assignments, record customer complaints, and any resulting corrective and preventive actions, using a central source of data.  <P> The system should also provide to the end-user an efficient way to access all relevant issues and action item data in real time. The end-user should have the ability to track status of a work request without assistance from technical department expertise.   Extraction of information for purpose of integration to legacy systems and desktop applications is also required.   System should also have the ability for multiple levels of security and flexible reporting. Background:Currently, service requests are either tracked through a complex paper trail, or automated systems designed for a single entity. Portions of the processes are automated, but the processes are labor intensive and difficult to maintain. The primary focus of the market survey is to evaluate a variety of options in order to find the best solution to automate the Work Order Tracking Process across all entities with in the Technical Center.FAA Technical Center is currently experiencing reorganization changes and ! implementation of new processes. Support units within the organization will be viewing project requests from a different perspective. Requests for support from within the organization will be viewed as a total package, as well as individual tasks. Successful monitoring and control of these types of requests will help to improve service and control costs and expenditures. A single system will provide the organization with a comprehensive tool for managing all work requests and related issues, deviations, results, complaints, observations, expenditures etc.The FAA is requesting that any potential offeror submit a two-page narrative of information demonstrating how the product meets or exceeds the requirements listed on the attachment.    A contractor is also required to provide commercial off the shelf  (COTS) pricing and licensing information.  The pricing information is exclusive of the two pages.  All vendors are advised that this market survey may be the only public announ! cement for this requirement and the FAA may choose to issue a screening information request (SIR) only to the firms who responded to this market survey.The due date for the information requested is May 21, 2002 by 2:00 pm EST.  Your submittal shall be directed to:FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center OT&A Acquisition Group, ACX-52 Attention:  Lisa Ferrante Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a contract to a very small business for research and development of products that will be used to assist FAA flight standards to determine airspace requirements, air traffic control procedures, and pilot operational and training considerations. A very small business is defined as a business whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the North American Industry System Classification Codes assigned to a contracting opportunity. The North Atlantic Industry Classification (NAIC) code for this requirement is 541990.  The objective of the project will be to evaluate GPS's ability to provide lateral guidance for helicopters flying under a Precision VFR (PVFR) mode of flight while using barometric altitude for vertical guidance.  A secondary objective will be to develop and demonstrate PVFR routes and ATC procedures that use GPS to enhance helicopter pilots' ability to navigat! e more efficiently in the National Air Space (NAS). <P> The contract performance period of four years, including options, is planned.  The estimated contract value will be $500,000 over the life of the contract. <P> The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market for other available sources with the capabilities, resources and qualifications to provide the research and development services required.  Vendors interested in submitting a proposal for this requirement must address the following qualification statements. <P>  1.	Demonstrate knowledge of the FAA flight standards and certification processes. <P> 2.	Demonstrate flight test project management test experience which includes the ability to develop, test, and evaluate PVFR and IFR procedures used for flight testing that contain a transition from non-precision GPS approach into a PVFR route. <P> 3.	Ability to coordinate, manage, and collect helicopter flight data for IFR and VFR departure and approach procedures. <P> 4.	Ability to characterize Navigation System Error of GPS in 2-D helicopter operations [along track and cross track under Horizontal Dilution Of Precision (HDOP) conditions ranging from 1.0 to 6.0]. <P> 5.	Ability to characterize Total System Error, both measured and calculated (Total System Errormeasured and Total System Errorcalculated), of GPS during helicopter PVFR operations with the pilot flying raw data inputs (GPS lateral guidance and barometric vertical guidance). <P> 6.	Ability to characterize flight technical performance of the helicopter pilot in the transition from instrument flight into a PVFR mode of flight.  These aspects include measuring the average time a pilot requires to transition from [total] IFR flight based upon cockpit instrumentation to a PVFR mode of flight, excessive pitch [airspeed control] and roll variations, altitude [control] variations, aircraft control problems during the transition. <P> 7.	Ability to evaluate, by pilot response to questionnaires, PVFR flight to determine the division of pilot attention to cockpit instrumentation and visual flight [looking outside the aircraft] as it applies to airspeed, altitude, and flight track performance. <P> 8.	Ability to develop instrument procedures using Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) TERPS criteria. <P> 9.	Knowledge and experience in using the FAA WJHTC's Ashtech Z-12 system. <P> 10.	Ability to develop instrument approach procedures, which incorporates the use of digital obstacle and terrain data, to conduct obstacle clearance evaluations, and evaluate air navigation route suitability <P> 11.	Experience with FAA flight inspection and certification in implementing approach procedures <P> 12.	A project manager who is also a high time qualified IFR helicopter pilot <P>  If you are interested in being considered for award of this requirement.  Provide a written qualification statement (not to exceed 15 pages) documenting each of the requirements listed above including references.  The qualification statements will be evaluated to determine if the vendors are able to provide the level of expertise needed to fulfill this requirement.  The vendors responding will be notified as to the results of the evaluation. If this survey results in a competitive acquisition, the competitors will be limited to those vendors who responded to this survey and were evaluated and determined to be a qualified vendor. <P> The qualification statements should be forwarded to the Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington D.C. 20591.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Clinical Sciences (DCS), Laboratory of Pathology intends to procure Catalyzed Signal Amplification Kits 15 mL, catalog number K150011, from DAKO Corporation, 22 North Milpas Street, Santa Barbara, California 93103.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The "Tissue Proteomics Initiative" (TPI) is an entity that exists between the Center for Biologics and Research (CBER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute.  It is the advancement of common research interests shared by CBER and NCI in the application and development of proteomic technology to the diagnosis and treatment of human cancer, development of proteomic tools that can detect and predict therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, further evaluate licensed and experimental drugs and biologics, and build upon the ongoing work emanating from the TPI.  The Catalyzed Signal Amplification System kit from DAKO is used as the mechanism for detecting the protein that have been immobilized on the surface of reverse phase protein arrays.   Reverse phase protein microarrays are prepared by applying picaliters of a tissue extract prepared from the cells procured by laser capture microdissection of human tissue.  The proteins of interest are detected by the catalyzed signal amplification kits developed and distributed by DAKO Corp. This system is an extremely sensitive immunochemical staining procedure incorporating a signal amplification method based on the peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of a biotinylated phenolic compound followed by secondary reaction with streptavidin peroxidase.  Comparisons to standard labeled streptavidin biotin methods have shown the DAKO CSA System to be on the order of 50-fold greater in sensitivity.  Furthermore, the CSA system is optimized for use with the DAKO Autostainer, a sophisticated immunohistochemical staining system already in place in this laboratory.  BASE PERIOD (Year 1):  The base period of performance will begin in May 2002 and end October 31, 2002.  During this period, NCI requires a minimum of 36 CSA kits 15 mL catalog number K150011 up to a maximum of 60 CSA kits15 mL catalog number K150011.  OPTION 1 (Year 2): The optional period of performance will begin November 1, 2002 and end  October 31, 2003.   During this period, NCI requires a minimum of 78 CSA kits 15 mL catalog number K150011 and a maximum of 208 CSA kits 15 mL catalog number K150011.  OPTION 2 (Year 3): The optional period of performance will begin November 1, 2003 and end October 31, 2004.  During this period, NCI requires a minimum of 78 CSA kits 15 mL catalog number K150011 and a maximum of 208 CSA kits 15 mL catalog number K150011.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of the current experiment in progress.  As stated above, this system is an extremely sensitive immunochemical staining procedure. This procedure allows detection of extremely small quantities of target proteins as would be seen in very small numbers of tissue cells. This notice of intent is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI  to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein.   Capability statements must propose the option(s) in order for the capability statement to be considered for review. Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 24, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft Purchasing Agent, via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  If submitting capability statements, one original and two copies are required.  Capability statements must be mailed to the following address: Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Address proposals to AFRL/MNK, Building 13, Suite 337, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn: Carol Abbott or Martin Kradlak.  Reference solicitation number MNK-PRDA-02-0007 on the outside of the package.  Proposals received after the cut-off date/time specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52-215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition" (May 2001).  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates. If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available.  B--REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Program Overview: This program intends to develop the technology required to bridge the fuzing gap that has emerged between blast/fragment warheads and penetration warheads.  In the blast/fragment area, the low altitude fuze sensor has evolved from a single nose-mounted unit that contained safe, arm, and fire components, a fuze sensor, and an explosive train with booster (FMU-113) to a distributed system with a nose-mounted fuze sensor (DSU-33), mid-body turbine generator (FZU-48) and a tail-mounted impact fuze (FMU-152).  Both of these designs require the fuze sensor to be nose-mounted and exclude using them with nose-mounted guidance kits.  By design, the penetrating warheads do not have a nose fuze well and do not allow the use of any existing fuze sensor to give them a height-of-burst (HOB) fuzing capability.  A tail-mounted fuze sensor that can be form factored to work with large (MK-83, MK-84, BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-116) and small (MK-81, MK-82, Small Diameter Bomb, etc.) guided weapons, which may or may not have nose-mounted guidance kits, is needed.  This device must be capable of interfacing with tail-mounted fuzes (FMU-152, FMU-159, etc.) by providing a selectable HOB fire signal, near surface burst (NSB) fire signal, and real time closing velocity information (as appropriate).  In addition to the tail-mount fuze sensor, the AFRL Targets Under Trees Program (TUT) has expressed the need for a precision, nose-mounted, foliage penetration HOB fuze capability that enables INS/GPS guided weapons to realistically engage targets in heavy foliage.  (2) Program Objective:  The FAST Sensors Advanced Development Program intends to develop the next generation fuze sensor for use with blast/fragment, penetrating, low collateral damage, and agent defeat unitary warheads.  Three modes of operation are required for this device:  selectable HOB, near surface burst (NSB), and penetration based upon the true ground level at the point of identified interest (targeted location).  A selectable HOB is needed because lethality studies show a significant increase in probability of kill (Pk) when the correct HOB is used against surface targets.  A NSB mode is also needed to achieve maximum Pk for a zero HOB.  Lethality studies also show the fuze sensor must determine a zero HOB because impact fuzes bury the warhead greater than 25 percent prior to detonation and significantly degrade lethality. In the penetration mode, the fuze sensor will provide a real-time closing velocity, and a ground impact signal to the penetration fuze for accurate calculation of weapon depth of burial.  The next generation fuze sensor will be highly resistant to Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Countermeasures (EMI/ECM) and must correctly function for closing velocities up to 2500 meters/second to support high speed (up to Mach 8) munition concepts.  (3) High Level Program Description:  A ground profiling, foliage penetration, precision HOB fuze sensor will be developed, fabricated, and tested in realistic environments.  This program will deliver two distinct capabilities:  (a) a precision HOB ground profiling, and foliage penetration capable fuze sensor in a tail-mounted configuration, and (b) a foliage penetration HOB upgrade for the DSU-33B/B proximity fuze sensor in nose-mount, tactical  form factor to support the TUT program.  (4) Technical Requirements and Goals:  As stated in section (2), two distinct capabilities will be developed, fabricated, tested and delivered.  The FAST sensor tail-mounted version requirements are as follows:  (a) Tail-mounted fuze sensor that will not interfere with the use of nose-mounted guidance concepts; (b) Capable of having electronically selectable HOBs up to 20 meters in increments of 0.5 meters; (c) Capable of providing HOB, NSB, initial time of impact (T0) and initial velocity at impact (V0) information that could be used with tail-mounted fuzes on unitary weapons; (d) Operation in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, including foliage; (e) Operation in battlefield EMI/ECM, including mutual interference; and (f) Launch-to-Burst Point weapon simulation.  The FAST sensor tail-mounted version goals are as follows:  (a) Less than 0.5  meter error in determining its correct, preset HOB above the ground contour, regardless of target structure and background; (b) Operate in blast/fragment and penetration weapon systems having ground profiling at velocities from 50-1250 meters/second, and determining T0 & V0 at velocities up to 2500 meters/second; (c) Provide a NSB mode that will detonate the weapon just prior to warhead ground impact, 0-80 degree impact angles, and (d) Production Cost for all up tail-mounted fuze sensor capability desired to be under $2,000 each in large quantities (20,000 units).  The TUT foliage penetration, nose-mounted version requirements are as follows:  (a) Nose-mounted foliage penetrating fuze sensor that can operate at 0-80 degree impact angles, with closing velocity of 50-500 meters/second, operate in clear terrain, and light to heavy foliage, and be in DSU-33B/B form factor (or smaller); (b) Capable of having selectable HOBs up to 20 meters in increments of 0.5 meters; (c) Use the same interface as the DSU-33B/B; (d) Operate in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, including foliage; (e) Operate in battlefield EMI/ECM, including mutual interference; and (f) Launch-to-Burst Point Weapon Simulation.  The TUT foliage penetration, nose-mounted version goals are as follows:  (a) Less than 0.5 meter error in determining its correct, preset HOB above the ground level; (b) Provide a NSB mode that will detonate the weapon just prior to warhead ground impact, 0-80 degree impact angles; and (c) Production Cost for nose-mounted fuze sensor capability desired to be under $1,500 each in large quantities (20,000 units).  (5) Program Tasking:  This development effort will consist of a Basic Award plus one Option that includes three parts (funding permitting).  The Basic Award will include both the Nose-mount and Tail-mount configuration designs, and a 10-month performance period that culminates in a Critical Design Review (CDR).  Technical results of the CDR will determine if the Option to continue the program should be exercised.  The Option, if exercised, is expected to bear a 24-month performance period, and include fabrication, test, and demonstration of:  Part A - Nose-mount version in tactical form factor; Part B - Tail-mount full up version; and Part C - Hardware and Software Components common to both Parts A and B.  Funding permitting, all three parts will be awarded as part of the Option.  However, if funding is insufficient to award all three parts, it is expected that Part C and one other Part will be awarded under the Option.  Thus, each of the three parts in the Option must be priced separately.  Pending inclusion in the Option, the nose-mount configuration tasking should be completed, through field-testing, no later than the 4th quarter of FY04.  The tail-mount configuration tasking should be completed, through field-testing, no later than the 3rd quarter of FY05.  (6) Fabrication of Hardware:  Pending inclusion in the Option, the contractor shall fabricate:  (a) all nose-mount configuration hardware in DSU-33B/B form factor according to the DSU-33 B/B Technical Data Package provided in the PRDA annex [desired nose-mount hardware includes one field test unit, and three tactical units ready for real-time drop testing]; and (b)  all tail-mount configuration hardware based on a Mk-82 sized conceptual tail cone.  [desired tail-mount hardware includes one field test unit that could be attached to a real or surrogate Mk-82 sized bomb body]  (7) Test Support:  If the Option is exercised, the contractor shall plan, schedule, conduct and/or support all aspects of the required testing, except as otherwise specified in this PRDA.  The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware and software products to be tested.  Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, will become contractual requirements.  When and if tests are conducted at Government facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for providing technical support, analysis, data, and test planning support to the identified responsible Government test organization.  (8) Affordability Tasking:  The contractor shall plan and implement an affordability program using the principles of Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD).  The contractor should address affordability as a key consideration in the development and demonstration of the two distinct program capabilities previously identified.  (Note:  A description and discussion of the IPPD Process Model can be found at http://www.jgai.com/stprocess50/index.htm).

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense Medical School and Health Sciences University, intends to award on a sole source basis, a contract to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HMJF) for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Rockville, MD, for annual support services for the Casualty Care Research Center(CCRC). This will include the provision of all personnel (on a personal services basis), supplies, equipment, and services to include sub-contracting support, necessary to support the CCRC. The CCRC is a designated Center of Excellence for issues relating to injury control and casualty care in combat, special operations and disasters, under the auspices of the USUHS Department of Military and Emergency Medicine. The contract will be cost-reimbursement with an annual estimated value of $1,250,633.87 and the base period of performance will be 12 months. The contract will consist of a base year and four one-year (12 month) options. The mission of the CCRC is to serve as a unique national resource by providing quality research, education and expertise in the delivery of medicine in austere field environments of combat, special operations and disasters. The CCRC requires a broad range of support activities to effectively carryout this mission. Because of an urgent need to continue the current mission and retain qualified personnel already working for the CCRC under contract, award will be made on or about 15 May 2002. This contract is being awarded in accordance with statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), "Authorized or Required by Statute." The proposed procurement is in compliance with Public Law 92-426, entitled: Uniformed Service Health Professions Revitalization Act of 1972 and 10 U.S.C 178 and 2113(j)(1)(A) which authorizes USUHS to award contracts on a sole source basis to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI).  The USAF Force Protection (FP)Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of commercial/government off-the-shelf equipment that could be used to provide tactical overhead imagery to deployed forces.  Given the current world situation, short notice contingency operations have become commonplace for US forces. These forces
often operate in areas where current imagery may not be accessible or available in a timely manner.  A simple, easy to use, portable device that could be launched locally and provide immediate overhead imagery to decision makers directing forces in the area would prove extremely valuable.  The equipment should require minimal training, have the capability to be locally
launched, and operate in all weather conditions.  It should operate emitting low or no noise and be difficult to visually detect.  It should be of minimum size and weight, man portable, and operate at a wide range of altitudes (100-meter minimum).  The equipment should have the capability to capture digital, high-resolution imagery, which can be immediately transmitted to a ground computer.  Finally, the equipment should be cost
effectively disposable, not reusable, and not retain the digital image information.   

Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a FP Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all
submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offeror's are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.     

Submission Information:  
Submissions will be accepted until COB EST, May 17, 2002.  Please submit to Mr. Bob Bal of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at balr@ctc.com <mailto:balr@ctc.com>  or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.
Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS MR. BOB BAL.  You may contact Mr. Bal with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6434.

General Information Concerning This RFI:

This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2).  There shall be no formal RFP.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the submittals received.  The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the systems submitted.   This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Air Force to pay any prototype
costs related to this announcement.  Offeror's are advised that only the Air Force FP Battlelab is legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), is undertaking a design, test, and evaluation project to investigate the use of occupant restraint technology in ambulance patient modules.  As part of this project, NIOSH has retained ARCCA, Inc., Penns Park, PA, a private GSA contractor, to provide engineering evaluation and test support.  The joint project team also is expected to include Defence Research and Development Canada, Impact Facility Group, Toronto through the Department of National Defence Canada, Canadian Forces Medical Group.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of EMS personnel while working either seated or standing in an ambulance patient module without compromising their ability to perform all necessary tasks.  Candidate systems, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, may be evaluated by sled testing or in an ambulance patient compartment during crash testing.  (The partners plan at this point to use Type I or Type III ambulances.)  Neither NIOSH or TARDEC promise purchase, analysis or testing of any presented systems.  While no party promises purchasing or testing, the right is reserved, to make single or multiple sole source acquisitions or partnerships based on engineering analysis/evaluation of suitable systems found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government.

Occupant Restraint System Design Parameters: (Systems should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.)

(A)  Capable of withstanding without failure loads in any direction produced in a 40G/100 msec crash with a 95th percentile male occupant;   
(B)  Capable of meeting a steady state 5000 lb load requirement in all directions without failure, as per FMVSS (US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) 210 - Required;  
(C)  Capable of restraining and accommodating all personnel sizes from 5th percentile Female to 95th percentile Male, - Required;  
(D)  Allows for increased mobility of EMS personnel, as compared to traditional restraints, preferably throughout the ambulance patient module. - Required;  
(E)  Provide easy donning and doffing, design attributes will be considered, - Required;  
(F)  Does Not hinder emergency exit,  - Required;  
(G)  Release mechanisms should be one-handed operation quick-release type, if used, - Preferred;  
(H)  May incorporate qualified inertia sensitive locking technology, - Preferred;  
 (I)  May incorporate load/energy attenuation technology, - Preferred;  		
(J)  Does not significantly impede EMS mission or performance, - Required;  
(K)  Capable of being retrofitted into current ambulances with minimal or no modification to the ambulance.  - Preferred;  
(L)  Affordable.  - Required ( Preferably with costing data for units in each, per 100, and per 1000).

NIOSH and TARDEC are seeking innovative solutions to address these major areas. Commercial solutions or technical solutions qualified and currently in production, or prototypes constructed with already qualified sub-components that meet these requirements are highly desired.  However, past testing proving each concept and design is not required.  If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost and pricing data of the product(s).  Vendors are strongly encouraged, but not required, to send one or more product samples.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completionof this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data.  Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement.  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period.  Vendors should note any proprietary data as such.  If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety. 

Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged.  The government has identified June 12th  and 13th, 2002 for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to strengthen Federal oversight and monitoring across the 16,800+ nursing homes that currently exist in the country while taking aggressive action steps to protect individuals who live in nursing homes through the use of comparative surveys, complaint investigations and special surveys of compliance. The potential contractor should have evidence to support his or her expertise, history and ability to engage and supervise a pool of highly skilled, qualified and trained professionals to conduct national certification and quality assurance reviews of long-term care facilities. 

In 1987, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act created the legislative basis for conducting Federal Monitoring Surveys (FMS). Sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Social Security Act require the Secretary to conduct Federal onsite surveys in at least five percent of a representative sample of skilled nursing facilities and in a representative sample of nursing homes in each State. 
CMS intends to assemble a national team of federal surveyors who shall be available on both a scheduled and as-needed basis to: (1) conduct federal Comparative surveys within two weeks to 30 days of a State survey to assess survey agency performance in the interpretation, application and enforcement of federal requirements and conduct follow-up visits (with CO/RO discretion) and (2) respond/react in a timely manner to crisis situations that endanger the health, safety or welfare of residents in skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities. 
It is planned that the first six months of contract year one to be a start up period that includes hiring employees, training, establishing protocols and other programmatic activities. This contract will include the option to renew for four successive 12-month periods depending on the preliminary findings. When the contract is in full operation, it is anticipated that approximately 4 scheduled surveys shall run simultaneously per week for a total of approximately 170 surveys per year with possible incremental increases depending on the findings. It is also anticipated that approximately sixty percent (60%) of the facilities surveyed will require follow-up reviews to ensure compliance with plans of correction. Approximately 10 of the surveys shall be special investigations that include complaints, observational or monitoring reviews and shall be conducted during the course of the Contract year. It is also anticipated that the Contract survey Team shall be readily available to respond to approximately 5 crisis assignments during the course of operational the Contract year. The potential contractor will assist CMS in the development of training materials, policies, procedures and other materials needed by the FMS for Nursing Homes Team Leader. 

Some of the tasks the contractor selected will be expected to perform include: 

Ensuring the immediate availability of qualified trained health professionals required to conduct the federal survey process on a national basis (registered nurses, medical doctors, pharmacists, dietitians, speech/occupational/physical therapists); 
 
Maintaining the skills and competencies of Team members to ensure consistent application of the Long Term Care requirements; Coordinating survey findings and post-survey reports and materials to CMS's Central and Regional Offices in a timely fashion; providing Regional Offices with all information necessary for enforcement action an serving as expert witness where necessary; Assuming the responsibility of the logistics of scheduling surveys, developing and analyzing data systems, scheduling teleconferences, arranging travel plans and other related activities; Providing a Quality Assurance system to ensure consistency and accuracy across surveyors and surveys conducted throughout the country; Developing training materials and policies and procedures and other materials as needed by the FMS for Nursing Homes Team Leader. 

Key Personnel Requirements

The Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy (DE) and Space Vehicles (VS) Directorates have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which may require the contractor (Leader Communications, Inc.; major subcontractor:  DataCom Sciences, Inc.) to access, for administrative purposes only,  proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  The required access does not involve the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information and will be granted to non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish these administrative tasks.  Examples of the administrative tasks include:

	a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files

	b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel in the DE and VS Directorates

c. Handling and administration of Small Business Innovation Research proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries

2. In view of the limited types of administrative access Leader Communications will be granted, DE and VS have obtained a waiver from the regulatory requirement for contractors to execute company-to-company agreements for protection of proprietary information. 

3. Instead, Leader Communications, Inc. will be contractually bound to protect this information and will be further required to protect this information by entering into non-disclosure agreements with its subcontractors and all personnel employed under the contract, as well as with the Government.  Copies of the non-disclosure agreements will be provided to the contracting officer.  Future R&D solicitations and contracts issued for DE and VS will include provisions similar to this notice, advising offerors that Leader Communications will require administrative access to proprietary data and that non-disclosure agreements will be executed.  Contractors with open DE and VS contracts will be individually notified and asked to provide written consent for Leader Communications to obtain administrative access to any proprietary data delivered under their contracts.
