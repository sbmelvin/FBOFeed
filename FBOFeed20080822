<DESC>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) intends to issue a sole source contract to procure a new Unwinder UW-6, manufactured by Hunkeler, to Standard Finishing Systems located at #10 Connector Road, Andover, MA  01810.  The Hunkeler Unwinder will replace the end-of-life Lasermax Unwinder that is starting to suffer from bracket failure.  The Hunkeler Unwinder will be the second piece of Hunkeler processing equipment affixed to the Oce web-fed printer.  The web-fed digital print system at GPO is used to generate the text for two key publications:  the Bound Record and the Trademarks.  The Unwinder is a critical piece of the web-fed printer system.  Without the Unwinder, there is no way to feed paper to the print engines.  The we-fed system is comprised of four basic components:  the Unwinder, the Print Engines (Oce), the Slitter/Sheeter (Hunkeler), and the Server that drives all three (Oce).  In order to minimize the number of different types of manufacturer interfaces, it is essential that the GPO use Hunkeler as the sole source of the Unwinder to "mirror" the Slitter/Sheeter already in place.  Send questions/comments regarding this requirement to abroadnax@gpo.gov on or before August 29, 2008.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES/PROPOSAL (RFQ/RFP)

<DESC>The government intends on awarding a sole source acquisition to GTB Technologies for GTB Endpoint Protector sorfware and GTB Inspector Appliance.GTB Inspector is an appliance that sits at the edge of the network before the firewall. The Inspector scans any outbound transmission from the network for the presence of secure content. All transmissions from the network to the Internet over any protocol and port, even unknown protocols, can be monitored and/or blocked. The Inspector is independent of network protocols and is file format agnostic. It is an appliance based on Linux and contains a pre-installed Oracle database for stored fingerprinted data. GTB assumes support for the entire system The GTB Inspector supports all protocols on all ports (even unknown protocols). Since it inspects traffic in real-time, unlike others, it can block transmissions on any protocol without integrating a proxy server. However, for SSL, the GTB Inspector integrates with any ICAP client enabled system. Both systems act as an ICAP client to terminate SSL. Since the Inspector is also an MTA, it can either quarantine emails or reroute emails to a third party encryption server. GTB Endpoint Protector is a true 'content aware' system that extends the data loss prevention system beyond the enterprise's perimeter to the client endpoint.GTB provides two content detection engines: A) Content Fingerprinting (CF) B) Data Pattern (DP) A. Content Fingerprinting (CF) The CF engine supports SPII or PII content which resides in databases or in files (binary or text).  The GTB engine uses a proprietary fingerprinting system which allows precise matching with zero false positives and with zero false negative rates.  Partial file matching is also supported as well as file format conversion. The GTB system includes all TCP protocols. No additional hardware or modules are required. The engine performs deep packet scanning in real-time and supports all TCP protocols including HTTPS. All file formats are supported since the engine does not require prior knowledge of the file type during real-time scanning. Multi field rules policies are supported. For SPII or PII, the engine supports pre-defined multi-field rules and policies which insure only true events are triggered. B. Data Pattern Engine (DP) The Data Pattern engine uses regular expressions to define data objects. Rules for such objects with sensitivity threshold are defined to trigger events. Objects maybe defined based on regular expressions including key words, lexicons, etc. DEFINING AND COMBINING POLICIES AND RULES: Defined policies are based on Objects and Rules for those Objects similar to a firewall method. Objects are defined for Protocols and/or Sources and/or Destinations. Sources or Destinations are defined based on LDAP names, based on URLs or based on a range of IP addresses.  GTB system can block (prevent) a transmission from leaving without needing additional hardware or modules. There is a separate setting for alerts and notifications. These can be set to alert specific manager(s) based on the policy. GTB ENDPOINT PROTECTOR GTBs Endpoint Protector is a data leakage protection solution addressing the growing problem of secure data leaving the organization through removable media devices such as memory sticks, CD/DVDs, or USB Drives. GTBs Endpoint Protector scans data for sensitive content before it is saved and then can block unauthorized transfers. The Endpoint Protector can also detect activities such as copy and paste, or use of sensitive data in an unapproved application, such as someone encrypting the data in an attempt to bypass the Endpoint Protectors block. Rather than restricting devices that connect to the network and passively auditing data transfers, the GTB Endpoint Protector offers organizations the ability to control what content can be transferred between the network and removable media devices. It provides complete access control addressing all USB, Firewire and all other removable media types, fully integrates with Active Directory/E-directory, manages detailed file auditing and offers both online and offline protection mode.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Cincinnati, Ohio, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Malvern Instruments, Inc. for Zetasizer Nano-ZS for the measurement of size, molecular weight and zeta potential of dispersed particles and molecules in solution. Includes 4mW 633 He-Ne laser. Temperature range 2deg.C minimum 90deg.C maximum (70deg.C maximum with disposable DTS1060 cell). Size range: 0.6nm to 6microns. Size range for zeta potential 5nm to 10microns. Concentration range for size measurement 0.1ppm to 40wt% maximum. Molecular weight range: 1X10E3 to 2x10E7Da. Compatible with Windows 2000 and XP operating systems.
<p>Unique characteristics of the item: Zetasizer Nano-ZS has fast measurement of zeta potential, particle size distribution, and molecular weight; measures concentrated samples; provides small-volume, disposable cells/electrodes to reduce contamination; provides efficient and user friendly software package; and utilizes phase analysis for zeta potential measurements, which offers 1000 times more sensitivity compared to frequency changes. The instrument also has available patented, disposable zeta potential cells that eliminate sample cross-contamination and eliminate the need for washing/cleaning zeta potential cells/electrodes. This cell is a flow-through design also capable of connecting with the Malvern MPT-2 autotitrator for determining the relationship between zeta potential and pH (or any other titratable function). <br />The instrument also includes the following:</p>
<p>1. The backscatter optics. At the 173 backscatter angle for sizing, the volume observed is about 8 times the volume observed with 90degree scattering optics, all other things being equal. This gives 8 times the detected count rate. This improvement relates directly to improved sensitivity.</p>
<p>2. The fiber detection system. The fiber detection optics ensure that the Signal/Background ratio or more correctly, the y-Intercept of the correlogram, is not degraded at these high detection volumes as it would with 'classical' optics. Increasing the count rate (using a higher power laser, for instance) while simultaneously reducing the intercept is of little value.</p>
<p>3. The high efficiency detector. A highly efficiency avalanche photodiode detector (APD), specially selected for dynamic light scattering applications is used, giving typically ten to fifteen times the efficiency of a photomultiplier, and hence ten to fifteen times the sensitivity. There are currently no other systems that use a backscatter configuration that have a high efficiency APD.</p>
<p>4. The optics. The design of the optics means that losses in the light collected are minimized.</p>
<p>5. The suppression of 'noise'. Sensitivity is not all about count rate, for example heterodyne backscatter systems have a very high count rate but low sensitivity. This is because most of the count rate in a heterodyne system is a reference signal that does not contribute to the data. What is as important as the count rate is the suppression of noise or flare, so that all the photons detected contribute to the data. There are a number of ways this is done in the ZETASIZER NANO SERIES: a) suppression of reflections in the optics set up, including the tilting of the sample cell b) optimizing the Signal/Noise automatically, by moving the cell to the optimum position to maximize the Intercept and the count rate c) Using symmetrical normalization in the correlator. This compensates for the statistical fluctuations between channels as the count rate varies, and gives a more reliable value for each channel. This achieves the same data quality in a shorter time, or conversely better data over an equivalent time d) Stabilization of the optics and electronics, so that count rates only 50% in excess of the count rate obtained from the dispersant are high enough to enable a measurement to be made and e) Use of a He-Ne laser gives an exceptionally low noise stable source, with an excellent polarization ratio and mode stability.</p>
<p>6. The high concentration capability. The backscatter configuration allows the instrument to adjust the depth of penetration into the sample cell automatically thus reducing the scattering volume for high concentration samples thus reducing or eliminating number fluctuations and/or multiple scattering effects. This improves the result accuracy and precision dramatically.</p>
<p>7. The ability to attach the instrument to an existing size exclusion chromatography (SEC) system to get real-time measurement of absolute size as macromolecules elute from a column. With optional flow-mode accessory (Part # ZEN9064), flow mode operation is possible with flow rates up to 1mL/min and allows connection of 1 or 2 external detectors and remote measurement start trigger signal for the collection and overlay of Intensity, hydrodynamic diameter and molecular weight estimate data with your existing signal(s) from UV and/or RI detectors. This method provides reliable molecular weight estimates in real-time without column calibration.</p>
<p>The Zetasizer Nano ZS is able to measure static, dynamic, Absolute Size Exclusion Chromatography (ASEC) and electrophoretic light scattering measurements for determining size, distribution, molecular weight and zeta potential in the same instrument with the same size and concentration range.</p>
<p>The Zetasizer Nano-ZS is unique in its use of backscatter optics, fiber detection technology, the use of an APD detector and an automated cell positioning mechanism. This gives the system the high sensitivity and also the widest range of applications.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Malvern Instruments, Inc. under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the capabilities identified above can submit to the Contracting Officer, within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Jennifer Bayer, Purchasing Agent, Reference #000HCCGD-2008-59611, CDC/NIOSH, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mail Stop C-4, Cincinnati, OH 45226. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Malvern Instruments, Inc. and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC><p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) anticipates releasing a solicitation to conduct scientific study of the risk of exposure to radiation in the environment. The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requires services from potential offerors with experience in radiation risk analysis relating to cancer, other chronic diseases caused by radiation, or adverse reproductive outcomes. The contractor must have diverse skills in risk analysis, toxicology, health physics, environmental exposure assessment, and estimation of health risks from chemicals and radionuclides and be able to satisfy the data quality objectives consistent with the planning, performing and assessing dose or risk-based released criteria based on Multi- Agency Radiation Survey &amp; Site Investigation Manual(MARSSIM) guidelines. The contractor will often be required to design and manage web pages or large databases and write computer programs. The contractor will require public communications skills for tasks such as writing newsletters and fact sheets, creating Web pages, preparing training material, and preparing multi-media public presentations. NCEH intends, within the limitations stated herein, to satisfy these requirements through the continued use of in-house scientific, technical and operational staff and through task orders under this contract.
<p>The Government intends to set aside qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541711, employee standard 500. Firms should have the capability to perform scientific services for the study of the risk of exposure to radiation. Because the timing and size of task orders cannot be entirely predicted, the work load may fluctuate during the year. Therefore, CDC contemplates an IDIQ type contract with firm-fixed price task order with Base Year and four Option Years, not to exceed 60 months. The Request for Proposal will be available on or about September 15, 2008 and will be posted to www.fbo.gov. No telephone requests will be accepted.</p>

The systems and accessories must improve the automation, sensitivity and software control of existing microscope systems, thereby improving existent measurement capability.  The two new microscopes must arrive fully automated and software controlled, and must be capable of making sensitive long-term measurements of viable cells in NISTs novel microfludic systems.  All of these microscope systems 
must be capable of software and hardware inter-operability, providing needed continuity between completed research experiments and research on the new systems.

The contemplated effort is a follow-on acquisition to continue development on a highly specialized piece of equipment as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This system being procured is an upgrade to the existing equipment 

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.  
	(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a 
	follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly 	specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to 
                      any other source would result in

                      (A)  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered 
                            through competition, or
                       (B)  Unacceptable delays fulfilling the agencys requirements.
                              (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B)

The existing equipment and the upgrade are commercial items.  Carl Zeiss Microimaging has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  

The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to Carl Zeiss.  Carl Zeiss has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide the required equipment.   

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by September 5, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, tissue core shipment and protein staining of colorectal tumor tissue micro arrays (TMAs) constructed in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial with The University of California at Los Angeles; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine; Reed Neurological Research Center, Rm. 3155; 710 Westwood Blvd.; Los Angeles, California, 90095.

 The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 611310 the business size standard is 6.5M employees.

The period of performance for this procurement shall be ten (10) months from date of award.

This procurement is to validate the automated Aperio ScanScope scoring system in a pilot study by comparing results with those by traditional pathologist manual review of the immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained TMA slides.  Upon satisfactory performance, the full study will be implemented by the automated Aperio ScanScope scoring system to determine protein staining status of COX-2, COX-1, AMACR, and global DNA methylation for 14 colorectal carcinoma TMAs and 5 adenoma TMAs.

The PLCO colorectal tumor TMAs for the 500 colon carcinoma cases (on 14 TMAs) and 700 colorectal adenoma cases (on 5 TMAs).provide opportunities to study altered protein expression of the tumors and relate the tumor characteristics with etiologic factors.  Utilizing the tumor TMAs established at UCLA, we aim to evaluate (1) the associations of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with subtypes of colorectal carcinoma and adenoma, as determined by protein staining status of COX-2, COX-1, and AMACR, and (2) associations of folate intake with subtypes of colorectal carcinoma and adenoma as determined by tumor global methylation status.

Previous studies examining risk factors by molecular subtypes of colorectal tumors were mostly small or case-control studies.  Confirmation is needed in a large, well-designed study, such as the PLCO Trial, where cases and controls had equal opportunity for detection of colorectal neoplasia and have reported life style and dietary behaviors prior to cancer diagnosis.  The specific aims require premalignant adenomas and malignant cancers to distinguish early events from consequences of malignancy, to inform etiology and effective prevention strategies.

The contractor shall perform the following tasks.

1. Ship all tubes containing approximately 1200 PLCO colorectal tumor tissue cores and 40 test cores in room temperature to NCI 

2. Validate protein staining data of COX-2, COX-1, AMACR, and global methylation status by comparing quantitative scoring to manual pathologist scoring of IHC-stained slides of test array of 20 cases 

3. Cut 15 TMA slides for each of the 14 colorectal carcinoma TMAs and 5 adenoma TMAs

4. Obtain protein staining data for COX-2, COX-1, AMACR, and global methylation status on 19 PLCO TMA slides of 1200 colorectal tumor cases (500 carcinoma and 700 adenoma cases)       

The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) has collected PLCO tissue cores, constructed the TMAs, and established the test array of colorectal tumors for the pilot study.  UCLA is the repository for PLCO Trial pathology tumor arrays; all the samples and associated TMA data are physically stored at UCLA.  No other source known to the NCI has the materials to provided the required services.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program, Statistical Research and Applications Branch intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Technology Assessment; 101 Merrimac Street, 10th floor; Boston, MA 02114-4724 for services regarding a Multiscale Lung Cancer Policy Model.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.501. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541712 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Period of performance:  September 30, 2008 through March 30, 2009.

The Massachusetts General Hospitals Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) is an affiliate member of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Lung Group, which focuses on modeling population trends.  The ITA team has developed a Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cancer control interventions, including screening strategies. As part of the ICBP program, the Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor (CViT) team has developed a multiscale NSCLC model for EGFR-ERK signaling path way of NSCLC within an in silico microenvironment.

The ITA team has initiated preliminary work on developing a reaction-diffusion model (more specifically, a growth model based on Cahn-Hilliard equations) to improve the spatial resolution of tumor growth for population-based screening models.  This component will utilize the output from the CViT NSCLC model to inform the tumor growth trajectory for the LCPM.  The goal is to create a lung cancer model with individual NSCLC patients biochemical details such as their responses to external stimuli, the underlying properties of signaling networks, and cellular biological responses, and improved spatial resolution for lung cancer screening.

The contractor shall:

1. Integrate a CViT NSCLC model into the ITA LCPM.  

2. Contractor shall make necessary coding changes to the model and perform simulations to generate outputs.  The technical details of model integration will be documented.

The mission of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) is to conduct health outcomes research to guide the development, evaluation and utilization of medical technologies that improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of medical care.  The Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor (CViT), brings together a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary group of investigators with interest in the biomedical, the computational and the mathematical aspects of cancer research. CViTs long term goal is to develop a generic, module-based tool-kit for modeling and simulating selected cancer types of interest such as breast, brain, lung cancer, and melanoma following a paradigm-shifting cross-disciplinary complex systems approach. Combined with cutting edge biomedical data, the modeling tool-kit will have significant value for experimental cancer research as it allows researchers to properly study cancer initiation and such critically linked progression features as invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis in the context of an emergent system. Ultimately, the tool-kit will also have important clinical applications including trial design and management as well as patient outcome predictions.

Both the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) and The Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor CViT teams are located at MGH, a unique environment with expertise in both population level lung cancer modeling and subcellular/cellular level modeling of non-small cell lung cancer.  The close connection between the two teams is imperative for collaboration with the model integration process and therefore Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) is the only source known to the NCI capable of performing the work outlined in the procurement.

In addition, since the extent of vascularization is related to the validity of tissue hormone levels when the tissue sample is homogenized, it is important to address the extent of vascularization in each tissue samples.  Thus, a subset of tissue selected from samples with high and low concentrations of tissue hormones will be stained to assess the extent of vascularization. This will then help to assess whether measured hormone levels in tissue is related to the extent of vascularization.
 The purpose of this procurement is to obtain service for the review of pathology slides (n=450) and immunostaining of slides (n=120) to assess the extent of vascularization in these tissue samples. 

The American Registry of Pathology (ARP) is at the forefront of urologic pathology and immunohistochemisty.  ARP has ample experience reviewing prostate cancer slides. ARP has reviewed more than 1,000 slides for the Prostate Tissue Study and has helped to design and develop standard form and procedure for slide review and for staining prostate tissue for assessment of vascularization.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Hospital Avenue, Ground Floor Block E, Nedlands Western Australia 6009 and with the University of Pittsburgh, 190 Lothrop Street, Suite 101, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 for services regarding Phase II Study of Depsipeptide in Patients with Cutaneous and Relapsing Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be for two months from date of award..</p>
<p>Overall Program.  The Molecular Therapeutics Section of the Medical Oncology Branch is the Center for Cancer Research at the NCI studies a large variety of lymphomas.  NCI has found depsipeptide (FR901128) to be effective in the clinic, in patients with lymphoma.  Due to promising activity observed in phase I testing, a phase II trial of depsipeptide is ongoing for patients with cutaneous or peripheral T-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p>The contractor shall discuss protocol NCI-01-C-0049 with each of their patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma who could be eligible for this clinical trial.  If the patient is willing to participate in the study, the contractor shall perform the required testing and physicals needed for a baseline assessment of the patient's condition and to be sure of their eligibility for the study.  The testing to be performed has a dual purpose, but this initial testing is to ensure the patients meet the health requirements to participate in the protocol.  Once eligibility is established the patient will receive depsipeptide and be treated on designed intervals.  The participating hospital shall report only the number of patients enrolled and their data to NCI.</p>
<p>In an effort to acquire a larger and more diverse population for this important study of depsipeptide, NCI contacted over 25 large medical institutions.  Many facilities were interested in the study but were not able to find patients that would be willing to be enrolled in a research study.  Dr. David Joske at Sir Charles Gairdner  Cancer Center in Australia surveyed the patients at his facility.  He was able to find 6 patients with lymphoma who are interested in enrolling in this Phase II Clinical Trial.  Dr. Larisa Geskins at the University of Pittsburg in Pennsylvania surveyed the patients at her facility.  She was able to find 10 patients with lymphoma who are interested in enrolling in this Phase II Clinical Trial.  These individuals are from Australia and other places in the world and are from a variety of cultural backgrounds, thus they would add to the numbers of the current patient population on the study and to the diversity of the population already in the study making Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and the University of Pittsburgh uniquely qualified to participate.  Therefore, adding these individuals would be beneficial to determine the utility of depsipeptide as a future cancer therapy.  Market research determined that these two facilities were the only two with patients with lymphoma who were willing to participate in this study.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  Two awards shall be made as a result of this pre-solicitation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a request for solicitation or a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on September 5, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Epidemiology Branch (NEB), Division of Cancer, Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis, measurements of plasma vitamin C concentrations with Craft Technologies, Inc. 4344 Frank Price Church Road; Wilson, NC 27893.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500 employees.


Period of Performance: One year from the date of award.

Esophageal and gastric cancers are the sixth and second leading causes of cancer death in the world respectively, while stroke is another leading cause of death.  Poor diets have been linked to esophageal and gastric cancers and stroke in many studies.  Vitamin C may be associated with the risk of these diseases, but very few epidemiologic studies have collected blood with appropriate preservatives to complete prospective analyses.  The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch is currently examining the hypothesis that plasma vitamin C status is associated with the risk of esophagealcancer, gastric cancer and stroke.  The overall purpose of this procurement is to measure plasma vitamin concentrations in 25 samples to assess the association between vitamin C and the risk of these diseases in Linxian, China, an area with marginal nutrition and high rates of all three of these diseases.

Contractor requirements:

1. Measure plasma vitamin C concentrations in the provided 25 microliter plasma samples.  Measurements shall be made using HPLC separation and vitamin C shall be detected using a UV detector and a second confirmatory detection method.   

The current acquisition is based on the need to generate data on plasma vitamin C concentrations using an efficient previously demonstrated valid method.  The Nutrition Intervention Trial cohort study provides one of the only analytical epidemiologic studies of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and stroke that collected blood samples with the appropriate preservative to stabilize plasma vitamin C.  Most clinical reference laboratories require plasma volumes much larger than necessary. The standard required volume at these laboratories is 1 ml of plasma or 1.5 ml in the case of suspected deficiency.  We expect many of our subjects to be deficient and cannot spare this large volume of plasma.  Craft technologies can complete the required assay using only 25&#956;l of plasma.  Craft Technologies can also provide a limit of quantitation of <0.2&#956;g/mL using this small volume of plasma. Craft Technologies Inc. is the only source known to the NCI capable of providing these services with the limited amount of plasma. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM ET September 2, 2008.  Faxed and E-mailed capability statements are not authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service Acquisition Division (DOC/NOAA/NESDIS/AD) intends to place an award on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source to John Hopkins University for continued research in Extension and Improvement of the APL/NOAA SAR Wind Retrieval System (ANSWRS) for the period commencing from time of award through February 28, 2010. Johns Hopkins University is the only source known to NOAA because of their role in rewriting the SAR Wind System which resulted in the APL/NOAA SAR Wind Retrieval System.<br />The work to be accomplished in this contract will (1) support the ANSWRS system throughout the 2009 hurricane season and beyond, (2) provide product and algorithm enhancements to better serve NOAA's customers, and (3) continue the development of the capability to derived accurate winds from the ALOS PALSAR instrument and the new X-band SAR satellites (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed).<br />Description of Work<br />There are four tasks involved in the extension and improvement of the APL/NOAA SAR Wind Retrieval System (ANSWRS).<br />Task 1 Implementationa of X-band Winds into ANSWRS<br />Data from the new X-band SAR satellites, COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X, are just now becoming available. Test and select an existing X-band SAR wind algorithm or develop a new algorithm to calculate winds from X-band SAR data and implement it into ANSWRS along with the capability to input, calibrate, and earth locate SAR data from COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X. Update the AKDEMO preprocessor to be able to ingest data from these new satellites and produce a standard AKDEMO SIO file. Evaluate the X-band wind performance by comparing them with other wind measurements from in-situ sensors, aircraft measurements, or satellite measurements. If appropriate data is obtained by NOAA, assess algorithm performance for high winds obtained in storms or hurricanes. Update ANSWRS documentation to document X-band changes.<br />Task 2 Enhancement of SAR Wind Directions within ANSWRS<br />Based on findings of an investigation being conducted by JHU/APL during 2008, develop and evaluate a system for improving SAR wind directions using a combination of model and SAR wind-aligned features. Assess and compare accuracy of the resulting winds with winds derived from just using model directions. Improve the ease of input of wind directions from other sources into ANSWRS through use of, for example, standardized formats and drop-in directories. Document the wind direction changes within the ANSWRS documentation.<br />Task 3 Hurricane Studies<br />Participate with NOAA/NESDIS/STAR in researching the use of SAR data to improve measurements of hurricanes, particularly the accuracy of high wind measurements.<br />Task 4 ANSWRS Maintenance<br />Perform occasional maintenance to ANSWRS as required when the system is ported to new computers at NOAA, or if software problems develop with changes in the instrument, satellite data coverage, or changes in operating systems. In addition, implement several improvements to the geophysical model function and the user interface. Specifically:<br />1. Help maintain the current version of ANSWRS and its documentation at NOAA at CSTARS, at JHU/APL, and at ASF for Radarsat, Envisat, ERS-2, and ALOS SAR data, and for COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X once they have been included in ANSWRS. Give priority to processing at NOAA. Support the calculation of hurricane winds at CSTARS during hurricane season.<br />2. Consult and aid NOAA/NESDIS/STAR personnel in wind field validation, particularly for hurricanes, and other high-wind-speed storms.<br />Deliverables<br />1. Modified ANSWRS system to include COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR -X X-band SAR winds. Update ANSWRS documentation to reflect system changes - by September 2009.<br />2. Evaluate X-band SAR wind performance, including for high winds in storms/hurricanes, if appropriate COSMO-SkyMed or other X-band SAR data are obtained by NOAA - by August 2009.<br />3. Develop and evaluate a system for improving SAR wind directions using a combination of model and SAR wind-aligned features by January 2010.<br />4. Modify ANSWRS software to process winds from SAR SIO-formatted data generated by the AKDEMO preprocessor by January 2010.<br />5. Improve ease of input (e.g. standardize format, drop-in directory, etc.) and document the system for input of wind directions from other sources into ANSWRS - sources such as WRF model, AOML best analysis field, scatterometer winds - by November 2008.<br />6. Partner with NOAA/NESDIS/STAR in SAR hurricane research in response to the Canadian Hurricane Announcement of Opportunity by June 2009.<br />7. ANSWRS (including the AKDEMO preprocessor) system maintained at NOAA, CSTARS, JHU/APL, and ASF - ongoing<br />Suggested Staffing<br />The level of effort is part time for a Principal Staff physicist for 16 months. Extensive knowledge is required of the APL/NOAA SAR Wind Retrieval System software, and associated web hosting system for wind products and meteorological analyses. Computer skills necessary to carry out the work are proficiency in Interactive Data Language (IDL), Unix, Linux, and HTML. Knowledge of the theory and practical experience in deriving wind measurements from SAR data are required.<br />Travel Requirements<br />Travel for training and presenting at conferences/workshops in relation to the above tasks may be required. <br />This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100k) NAICS code 541712. This is not a request for a competitive proposal. It is a notice of intent to award a contract on a sole source basis for continued research. All information in relation to this notice must be submitted electronically to Yolanda Jordan at Yolanda.jordan@noaa.gov by 3:00pm on Friday September 5, 2008.</p>

This requirement is for a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for batteries as test samples for the H-1 Upgrade Program, to insert GFE batteries into new production helicopters, and for use as a rotating pool of spare batteries for use on production line of helicopter assembly, with a minimum/maximum quantity of 11/75 batteries.  
The solicitation will be available on or about 19 August 2008 at the following address: http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this contract on a Sole-Source basis to MarathonNorco Aerospace Inc., 8301Imperial Drive, Waco, TX  76712-6888.  The basis for restricting competition is that MarathonNorco is the only known source that can manufacture the batteries to meet the Governments requirements, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.  
All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.   It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.As there is no other source available that can provide the services expressed in section 3, there are no actions that can be taken to remove or overcome any barriers to competition (i.e., there is no competition available).

<DESC><p>SOURCES are SOUGHT for the following:
<p>Gas Gun Data Acquisition &amp; Control System</p>
<p><br />A precision-impact gas gun is being installed at the Eglin AFB Site C-64, Range C. In typical experiments, this gun accelerates a small "hockey puck" of material on the front of a projectile. This "driver" impacts another hockey puck of "target" material to temporarily increase its pressure and make it behave as it would during the detonation of an explosive munition.<br />Successful precision-impact gun experiments must be well CONTROLLED. The gun system includes a large vacuum pump to remove nearly all the air from the gun barrel and target chamber. After this is complete, valves must be closed to prevent debris from the impact even from fouling the vacuum system. There are also multiple ports, valves, and electrical connections that must be in various states (open, closed, on, off, etc.) and the vacuum level must be measured and verified. The gun Control System must know the allowable operating ranges for all components and verify these through multiply-redundant means before allowing an experiment to be performed. Specific details are listed below.<br />Successful precision-impact gun experiments must ACQUIRE ALL DATA. The impact event takes approximately 5 microseconds (i.e. 5 millionths of a second, 0.000005 second). During that time a lot of data must be acquired to help us understand how the material behaves during the impact. A typical test can take a month to prepare and set up for, so it is critical that all the data be acquired and stored for later analysis. Again, multiply-redundant data acquisition paths are required from the VISAR signal point through the initial data storage (on hard drive). This should be achieved with physically isolated scopes, chassis, cables, hard drives, etc. such that a failure in one system will not affect the other.</p>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
FUTURE CONTRACTS
CIO-SPNEW
1. Background
	
The federal government is committed to changing its business processes to achieve a world class standard of excellence.  This is being accomplished by adopting best business practices and the latest technology to create a more efficient, citizen-centered federal government. 
	
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been designated as an executive agent for purposes of providing Information Technology (IT) to the government.  Under this authority, NIH established three Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) to support the full range of IT needs across the federal government, with a particular emphasis on agencies like NIH and its parent, HHS that are involved in health care and clinical and biological research. 
	
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to open a dialogue with industry and potential federal government customer agencies as NIH formulates its sourcing strategy and request for proposals for the next generation contract (or contracts) to support government IT efforts, with a focus on health and research IT.  This next general contract (or contracts) will be a successor to the current Chief Information Officer  Solutions and Partners 2 Innovations (CIO-SP2i) and the Image World 2 New Dimensions (IW2nd) GWACs, which will be expiring in December 2010.  The third GWAC, the Electronic Commodities Store (ECS) III contract, is not expiring until 2012 and will continue to stay in effect.

The governments goal in this effort is to award the new contract (or contracts) to replace the CIO-SP2i contract and the IW2nd contract as far in advance as practical to facilitate effective contract transition.  Although there is no guarantee of future work under the successor contract (except for the minimum guarantee normally included in Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts), approximately $2.95billion has been ordered through these two GWACs over the life of the contracts from all sources.  Approximately 56% of that total was for HHS customers, including NIH.    

2. Scope

Using the current contracts as a baseline, the government may award one or more Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) in several functional areas.  Contractors will be given an opportunity to qualify in one or more of these areas.  Services are contracted for as needed via competitive task orders with the resultant GWAC holders. The government is also interested in ways to maximize opportunities for small and disadvantaged business concerns.  

The government currently envisions ten functional areas in the new contract (or contracts).   Over the ten year lifetime of the anticipated contract, technology will evolve, and as such, the government is looking to industry for innovative solutions in helping to develop a scope of work that meets current and future needs of the NIH, HHS, and the government-wide IT community, with a focus on health care IT, aligned with the Federal Enterprise Architecture.  The ten task areas described as follows are intended to be applied broadly to technology services and incorporate these technology advances. 

Specific details of task assignments, deliverables, documentation, training, applicable government/department/industry standards, etc., will be provided within individual task orders.  Individual task orders may include components from one or more task areas. 

Task Area 1  Chief Information Officer (CIO) Support.  The objective of this task area is to provide support to CIOs in implementing relevant laws, regulations, and policies, such as Paperwork Reduction Act, the Computer Security Act, Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) #63, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and the Clinger-Cohen Act. Typical tasks may include services such as Total Cost of Ownership Studies, market research, agency enterprise architecture and information technology (IT) architecture support, A-76 studies, workforce management studies, IT Investment Board Process support, and SEI/CMMI analyses and implementation support.

Task Area 2  Outsourcing.  The objective of this task is to provide the IT infrastructure and IT services required to assume management and operations of government IT resources and IT business functions. 

Task Area 3  IT Operations and Maintenance.

The government appreciates focused responses for each topic. Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information or details based on their initial submittals. 

This RFI is for planning purposes only and there is no intention to acquire any products or services, or award any contract, based on this RFI. Information contained in this RFI is the result of experience with the current GWACs and is therefore potentially subject to modification and is in no way binding on the government. An appropriate RFP process may follow in the June 2008 timeframe, contingent upon final approval for the project.  

The government does not intend to pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the government will arise because of submission of responses to this RFI and the governments use of such information.  

The government prefers that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.  However, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary, or represents confidential business information, will be received and held in confidence. Proprietary information submitted, as part of responses to the RFI, should be clearly identified as COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE and it will be treated in-confidence. 

Prospective vendors and government agencies may also submit questions regarding the project.  Questions should be addressed to the same email address: RFI-NITAAC@mail.nih.gov.  Answers to questions received on or before May 7, 2008 will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.  The government may consider questions received after that date, but there is no obligation for the government to post any further answers.

5. Directed Topics for Responses 

The government requests vendors respond to the RFI in the order specified in the sections below.  

5.1Sourcing

5.1.1 Currently, NIH is obtaining these services under two separate GWACs, the CIO-SP2i and IW2nd. Considering how imaging is being integrated throughout other IT systems, NIH is planning on combining these two contracts into one.  Please describe any advantages or disadvantages and whether imaging should be a separate functional area in the contract or integrated with the other functional areas.
5.1.2 What strategies should be employed in the RFP to assist in a Best Value award determination?  What best practices have been employed in other similar types of contracts?
5.1.3 To maximize opportunities for small (SB) and small disadvantaged business (SDB), NIH is considering the possibility of having a separate bidding category for task orders that are set aside for SB and SDB.  Do you think this is a necessary feature to improve opportunities for small businesses? Are there other ways NIH can improve opportunities for SDBs?
5.1.4 How should NIH best incorporate small business into the sourcing strategy that will provide maximum opportunities for the various small business categories, such as woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, small disadvantaged, HubZone, etc.?
5.1.5 Should incentives be built in for small disadvantaged business, and if so, what should these be?
5.1.6 What strategies should be employed to take a successful performance based approach?  
5.1.7 What off-shoring issues should be considered to ensure that national interests and sensitive information is protected, quality and reliability is high, and that the IT solutions are aligned with NIH and federal government practices and standards?
5.1.8 CIO-SP2i included an explicit task area for ERP. Is this task area still important to identify as a separate focus area?
5.1.9 In the interest of attracting capable contractors who specialize in areas of interest to NIH, contractors may be qualified on a subset of the 10 task areas. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of partial qualification? Should this strategy be applied to all contractors or just SDBs as it was on CIO-SP2i?
5.1.10 Should there be any limitations on administrative fees that are remitted to NIH to reimburse NIH for the cost of administering the contract and task orders?
5.1.11 Considering that a 10-year contract is being envisioned, and considering the quickly changing technology anticipated during that period, what provisions, if any, should be made to allow additional contractors to participate during the course of the contract?  Are you familiar with any other procurement where this was done successfully?
5.1.12 What provisions should be included, if any, to allow contractors to qualify for additional functional areas during the course of the contract?
5.1.13 Should the contract include restrictions on the use of subcontractors, e.g., having vendors list their subcontractors in the contract and restricting subcontractors to work with only one prime contractor at a time?

5.2  IT Policy Compliance
5.2.1 Support to the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) will be maintained through a mapping of contract functional areas to the FEA, rather than a direct citation of the FEA elements as the scope. The assumption is that this will provide a more familiar and understandable depiction of the scope and make it easier for vendors to qualify for individual task areas. Is this assumption valid?

5.3 Scope

5.3.1 Are there other functions, capabilities, and features beyond those currently contained in the CIO-SP2i and IW2nd GWACs that should be added to the new contract scope either because they are related services or that they represent directions that industry or potential government customers predict will become more germane to this domain area in the future?

5.4 Architecture 

5.4.1 Are there issues to be considered when mapping to the Federal Enterprise Architecture?

5.5 Security
5.5.1 Are there recommendations to consider regarding architectural and technical information on the security provisions that would be suitable for this contract (s). 
5.5.2 What risks exist and what mitigation steps can be taken? 
5.5.3 How is privacy information secured and protected in your data base?
5.5.4 How and where is authentication done?
5.5.5 How is the information secured during transmission?
5.5.6 What challenges, if any, are there for your company to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) requirements?
5.5.7 What challenges, if any, are there for your company to comply with and utilize standards and guidelines promulgated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in its entity-wide information security program? 
5.5.8 What challenges, if any, are there for your company to comply with the applicable standards, implementation specifications, and requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security rule, found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/Downloads/securityfinalrule.pdf covering electronically protected health information?  

5.6 Best Business Practices
5.6.1 Are there best business practices you could recommend that are pertinent to this project?
5.6.2 Are there best business practices you could recommend that are specific to the IT industry?
5.6.3 Are there best business practices you could recommend that would better automate task order processing?  
5.6.4 Are there any other suggestions or ideas for NIH to consider in this requirement?

<DESC><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to NanoDrop Technologies, LLC, 3411 Silverside Road, Bancroft Building, Wilmington, DE 19810 to purchase a Themo Scientific NanoDropTM 3300 Fluorospectrometer. NanoDrop Technologies, LLC is the authorized distributor for Thermo Fisher Scientific who is the only manufacturer (globally) of this instrument. The EPA believes that NanoDrop Technologies, LLC is the only authorized distributor for Thermo Fisher Scientific for this instrument. Molecular genetics research requires instrumentation to quantify volumes as small as 1 microliter (1 ul) and amounts as low as 2 picograms (2 pg) of nucleic acids (RNA and double-stranded DNA). These attributes of high sensitivity and sample conservation are necessary because these nucleic acids are derived from biological samples that are rare, require extreme effort to acquire and/or are very small in size. Molecular genetics research samples have been performed on this type of instrument in collaboration with the USEPA/ORD/Ecological Exposure Research Division (EERD), Cincinnati, OH. New samples to be analyzed at EPA must be compatible with previously analyzed samples using similar fluorescent technology. Using these same methodologies will prevent data degradation, permit continuity and compatibility of data with all sample data sets analyzed. All sample data sets will be combined in the ORD molecular genetics research program. The circumstances permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), "Only one source reasonably available". Any parties disagreeing with the above mentioned statement and can provide documentation supporting the above should notify the listed Point of Contact. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Responses shall be sent to or emailed to the following Point of Contact: US Environmental Protection Agency/ORD/NHEERL/Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, RI 02882-1153 or reslock.glennis@epa.gov.<br />No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.</p>

<a href="mailto:wes.burnett@us.army.mil">Western Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>A. The Northwest Region seeks to initiate the standardization process for Casting Material Products for its 7 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alaska & Washington.  This will be a replacement/re-evaluation of RIA R11-03-02-005 which expired Jan 2008. The product line consists primarily of both fiberglass and plaster products in the following sizes:  casting tape- 1 inch x 2 yards, 2 inches x 4 yards, 3 inches by 4 yards, 4 inches by 4 yards, and 5 inches by 4 yards; and casting splints: 2x 10, 3x12, 4 x15, and 5x 30, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, Usage Items.<BR><BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is 10/08.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Patricia Cordier, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail patricia.cordier@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.  Products & Performance Required <BR>The Region is seeking Casting Material Products which at a minimum include the product lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $149,711.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>TAPE CAST 3INX4YD PLUS WHITE<BR>PADDING UNDERCAST WEBRIL 6IN X 4YDS<BR>TAPE CAST 4INX4YD PLUS WHITE<BR>TAPE CAST 5INX4YD PLUS WHITE<BR>PADDING UNDERCAST WEBRIL 4IN X 4YDS<BR>PADDING UNDERCAST WEBRIL 3IN X 4YDS<BR>SPLINT 5INX30IN SPECIALIST EXTRA<BR>TAPE CAST 3INX4YD PLUS BLACK<BR>TAPE DELTA-LITE 3'X4YDS WHITE<BR>CASTGARD HALF ARM ADULT REG<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@amedd.army.mil All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.   Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company       criteria is defined as follows: <BR><BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of casting material products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  both fiberglass and plaster casting tape and splints in the following sizes:  <BR><BR>casting tape- 1 inch x 2 yards, 2 inches x 4 yards, 3 inches by 4 yards, 4 inches by 4 yards, and 5 inches by 4 yards; <BR>casting splints: 2x 10, 3x12, 4 x15, and 5x 30.  <BR><BR>Note that additional requirements may become required items of supply in the future.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA (or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number) for the Casting Tape and Splints product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the prime vendor for distribution in the Northwest Region (Region 11).  <BR>a.	Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.  <BR>b.	Please provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.<BR><BR>4.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Northwest Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  <BR><BR>5.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  <BR>a.	Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  <BR>b.	Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.<BR>c.	Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.<BR>d.	Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.  <BR><BR>6.  Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for casting tape and splint products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>a.	Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>b.	Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.<BR>c.	Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question. <BR><BR>7.  Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all products to be supplied.  Provide this information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFQ.  Provide information explaining whether or not the instructions/directions are supplied with the individual item packaging, or are provided with the larger units of packaging only (ie per case, etc.).<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a clinical setting. <BR><BR>1.	The following procedures will apply. <BR><BR>a.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. <BR>b.	Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c.	All email communications between vendors and the region concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d.	Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e.	Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.  <BR>2.	The samples to be provided are as follows: <BR><BR>Fiberglass Casting Tapes:  <BR>1.	2 inches wide by 3- 4 Yards long    <BR>2.	3 inches wide by 3- 4 Yards long  <BR>3.	4 inches wide by 4-5 Yards long  <BR>4.	5 inches wide by 4-5 Yards long <BR>5.	6 inches wide  by 4-5 Yards long <BR>Plaster Casting Tapes:<BR>1.	2 inches wide by 3- 4 Yards long  <BR>2.	3 inches wide by 3- 4 Yards long  <BR>3.	4 inches wide by 4-5 Yards long  <BR>4.	5 inches wide by 4-5 Yards long  <BR>5.	6 inches wide by 4-5 Yards long<BR>Fiberglass Splints:<BR>1.	2 x 10 Inches<BR>2.	3x 12 Inches<BR>3.	4 inch by 15 inches<BR>4.	5 inch x 30 inches<BR>5.	5 inches x 30 inches <BR>Plaster Splints:<BR>1.	4 inch by 15 inches<BR>2.	5 inch x 30 inches<BR><BR>3.	The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluation will take place in a clinical setting.  <BR><BR>4.	The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.  .<BR><BR>5.	The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  Each criterion below will be evaluated in the clinical setting by using each product listed in the sample set on at least 5 patients with the exception of item 3 for casting tape, and item 2 for splints which will be determined by examining the package prior to use on the patients.<BR><BR>Casting Tape (fiberglass and plaster):     <BR>1.  The product unrolls evenly and does not bunch during application to the body part. <BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature because wrinkled/bunched product can cause pressure points resulting in pressure sores/ulcers on patients skin.<BR>b.	During application of product, evaluator will observe product as it unrolls and note any wrinkling or bunching.<BR>2.  The product molds to the extremity providing proper fit (provides support/immobilization without excessive gapping or bulging.) <BR>a.	Clinicians require proper molding to prevent movement of the injured body part which promotes fracture healing.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe whether immobilization is sufficient to prevent patient movement<BR>3. The type/size of each product can be quickly identified from markings on the packaging.  <BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature because clinician time is wasted and efficiency decreased if they must pick up and examine a product to discover type/size of the product.  Additionally, since fiberglass begins to cure/harden if the package is open to air, product identification without having to open the package means dollars saved for the facility.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will determine if type/size can be seen by quickly glancing at the package.<BR><BR>Splints  (fiberglass and plaster):<BR>1.  The product molds to the extremity providing proper fit (provides support/immobilization without excessive gapping or bulging.) <BR>a.	Clinicians require proper molding to prevent movement of the injured body part which promotes fracture healing.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe whether immobilization is sufficient to prevent patient movement<BR>2.  The type/size of each product can be quickly identified from markings on the packaging.  <BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature because clinician time is wasted and efficiency decreased if they must pick up and examine a product to discover type/size of the product.  Additionally, since fiberglass begins to cure/harden if the package is open to air, product identification without having to open the package means dollars saved for the facility.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will determine if type/size can be seen by quickly glancing at the package.<BR><BR><BR>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the actual acceptability threshold (at or near 3.1 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines. (3) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>

(End of provision) 
The provision 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items applies to this acquisition as follows:
 
EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
a. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
Sub-factor 1: The Government will evaluate the technical capability of the item offered to determine the vendors ability to provide the product meeting the USCG specifications. Vendors shall provide sufficient and detailed related information to clearly demonstrate the vendors capability to provide products meeting these specifications. 
b. RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Relevant past performance includes three (03) years experience in manufacturing and maintenance support of Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS).

Vendors shall complete the designated section of the Contract Data Sheets (Enclosure 1) for up to three of their most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) in which the vendor built and supplied an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS). The Contractor shall forward the Contract Data Sheet to the contract specialist listed on the document with the offeror. The Contractor is NOT to fill out the questionnaire section of the Data Sheet. The questions provided are typical of but no limited to type of questions will be asked of the past performance source. If the vendor does not have any Federal Government contracts, then list state, local, or commercial contracts, in that order. Responses shall be brief and concise. Data submitted other than that requested on the Contract Data Sheets will not be considered.  Failure to submit Contract Data Sheets shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for the Government to evaluate. A vendors lack of relevant past performance will be rated as neutral. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those listed in the vendor's proposal.

c. PRICE: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Vendors shall provide their total proposed price to meet the requirements outline in the specifications. 

Basis of Award: This order shall be awarded to the vendor determined to represent the best value to the United States Coast Guard. Overall technical approach is considered to be more important than past performance; however, technical approach and past performance combined are more important than price. As the technical evaluation scores converge, price may become more important. 

 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<SOLNBR>W91RUSJA08083

<CONTACT>David Freshour, 520-533-1789

<a href="mailto:david.freshour@us.army.mil">ACA, ITEC4 - West</a>
<DESC>Under Authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to modify contract DABL03-03-C-0025 with CORDEV Corporation, exercising FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, for Administrative Telephone Services at Fort Bliss Texas. The government will exercise the full 6 month extension allowed under this clause for the period 1 October 2008 through 31 March 2009.  Any responses or inquiries to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government. Responses are due by noon, 5 September 2008 and addressed to David Freshour 520-533-1789 or email david.freshour@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>The Justification and Approval (J&A) is attached below:<BR><BR>1.  Contracting Activity:  Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center-West (ITEC4-W), 2133 Cushing Street, Building 61801, Fort Huachuca, Arizona 85613-7070.<BR><BR>2.  Description of Action: <BR><BR>Request approval for extension of performance under FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, for the period 1 October 2008 through 31 March 2009 for Administrative Telephone Services (ATS) at Fort Bliss, TX, pending the outcome of the re-evaluation of the IMCS II Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This will be an extension of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract originally awarded with a base year and four option years.  The total estimate for the six month extension is $2,553,798.24 using FY09 Operation and Maintenance Army (OMA) funds.  This extension includes an increase in O&M support above the original contract limits requiring this justification and approval.<BR><BR>3.  Description of Supplies/Services: <BR><BR>The Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this effort is for operations and maintenance of the ATS at Fort Bliss, TX.  These services include the operation, administration, and maintenance of Fort Bliss, classified and unclassified enterprise network and customer local area networks.  The scope of work on this effort includes: administration; management; parts, supplies, tools and equipment other than GFE; and vehicles to operate and maintain the Administrative Telephone System, Special Projects and cable plant at Fort Bliss, TX.  This includes Switchboard Console Operations, Inside Plant, Customer Services (Telephone), and Outside Plant (Cable) required by the Directorate of Information Management (DOIM) to support the organizations at Fort Bliss.  The contractor shall provide technical and administrative coordination of inside plant (ISP), outside plant (OSP) and other on-base telephone activities; track and complete all telecommunications service orders.  The contractor shall also be responsible for operations and maintenance (O&M) of the Intuity Audix Voice Mail System, Call Accounting System, and data input of Local Service Requests (LSR), cable record changes, associated components and instruments into the Telephone Management System (TMS).  The contractor may also be required to provide material, overtime, travel and per diem, and training in support of requirements, as needed.<BR><BR>4.  Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) Only One Responsible Source.<BR><BR>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:<BR><BR>These services are currently being provided under contract DABL03-03-C-0025, with CORDEV Corporation, a small business.  The current performance period expires on 30 September 2008.  These services are being competed as part of a larger consolidated, competitive, small business set aside, the Information Management Communications Support II (IMCS- II) effort.  This requirement is necessary to allow for the Contracting Officers actions in response to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) protests and subsequent re-evaluation of offers submitted for the IMCS II IDIQ contract.  After resolution of protests, the Government requires time to conduct a mini competition between IMCS II vendors, conduct site visits, evaluate proposals and place orders.  Placement of the task order for Fort Bliss is anticipated for the January 2009 timeframe with full performance expected to begin March 2009.  It is anticipated that award of a task order for Fort Bliss can be made within two months.<BR><BR>If this J&A for a 6-month extension of services is not approved, it will prevent Fort Bliss from providing telephone service for wireless and landlines customers supporting the increased mission, maintenance of classified and unclassified enterprise network, and supporting the local area networks.  Fort Bliss DOIM serves many important customers such as the U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery School, 1st Armored Division,  Joint Task Force (JTF) North, United States Army Sergeants Major Academy,  32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, Army Evaluation Task Force (AETF), William Beaumont Army Medical Center, and the German Air Force Air Defense Artillery School.<BR><BR>Background:<BR><BR>In February 2008, the Director of the Fort Bliss DOIM, along with the Contracting Officers Representative (COR), contacted this office to discuss the significant changes happening at Fort Bliss and how these changes were presenting challenges to the current contract.  One of the challenges was how to provide O&M support to hundreds of buildings and structures, not on the current contract, that were being accepted and ready for occupancy by new organizations as well as the numerous digital training ranges activated to meet new training needs.  <BR><BR>Another area of concern was the possible expiration of local contracting vehicles, put in place by the Fort Bliss Directorate of Contracting for use by all Fort Bliss customers, and used by DOIM to purchase materials for O&M of this contract.  In March 2008, the COR notified this office that the contract vehicles expired and that all materials to support ATS must now be purchased on contract DABL03-03-C-0025.  The materials CLIN on the current contract was intentionally a low estimate because of the availability of these local contract vehicles.  Since their expiration, the materials CLIN has increased exponentially to meet the normal O&M requirement.<BR><BR>In July 2008, the Technical Representative from the NETCOM G4 conducted a site visit to Fort Bliss, to get a sense of the increased operational tempo and the impact on the current contract.  Of  the numerous changes occurring at Fort Bliss, the most obvious was the installation and erection of entire troop villages consisting of Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) that serve as housing and office space.  These villages are semi-permanent structures that require support through the ATS contract.  There are also 27, new or reactivated, training ranges that previously required no or minimal telecommunications support that are now used on a full time basis by units deploying to Southwest Asia.  These ranges support, on a yearly average, 20,000 soldiers and now require daily O&M support and on-call critical mission support. <BR><BR>The current contract, originally awarded in September 2003, supports and services approximately 20,000 phone and data lines.  Since 2003 an additional 10,000 phone and data lines have been added with a targeted capacity of 50,000 by 2012.  Approximately 500 buildings or structures were on the original contract.  That number has doubled since 2003 and is projected to double again by 2012.  The soldier population at Fort Bliss stood at 4,500 in 2003; today the population is well over 16,000 and is expected to be 45,000 by 2012.  In the next few years, no other CONUS installation will see a population growth larger than Fort Bliss.  The current Administrative Telephone Service contract performed by CORDEV Corporation will expire 30 September 2008.  The publics interest will be served by ensuring the continuation of the Fort Bliss DOIM mission requirement is met by a qualified contractor performing the essential services without interruption.<BR><BR>The Government has analyzed and evaluated the use of potential alternatives such as; a) maintaining current levels of support, b) allow expiration of contract, c) use of in-house resources, and d) awarding to a different contractor to perform this effort.  This analysis concluded that none are practicable in the short term.  Allowing the contract to expire would cause significant and irreparable harm to the Government.  The Government does not have nor expects to have the expertise or in-house resources to perform this effort in the near term.  Award to another source at this point would cost the government time (a potentially extensive learning curve and familiarity with the site); significant duplication of cost that would not be recouped through competition; and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.  It is not in the Governments best interest to compete this short six-month requirement for interim support.  A new contractor would require additional time to be able to satisfy the requirements.  The time would be spent hiring employees and purchasing vehicles, tools and test equipment.  Duplication of costs would result from those purchases, estimated at a minimum of $175,000 (based on historical data).  In addition, conducting site visits and solicitation preparation and evaluation would result in duplicative costs and effort for Government personnel.  Government resources are already tenuous.  In addition, competition for this six-month extension could potentially result in at least two different contractors providing services over the course of a few months, creating personnel turbulence, significant learning curves, and potential loss of critical employees.  Turnover of this magnitude would be harmful to the mission. Finally, it appears unlikely that any contractor can mobilize at this point in time to even attempt the effort.<BR><BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  <BR><BR>As required by FAR 5.201 and 6.305, this Justification & Approval document will be synopsized on or about August 22, 2008 and made available for public inspection and comment.  The closing date for the synopsis will be 15 days after posting, or approximately September 5, 2008.  Any responses or inquiries will be addressed and any offers that demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition will be more advantageous to the Government will be considered.  To date, no companies have expressed an interest in performing this short term effort.<BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition: <BR><BR>These services have been competed as part of the IMCS II requirement and significant competition has been obtained.  A Notice of Intent for the IMCS II IDIQ contract, which included the Fort Bliss ATS effort, was synopsized on FedBizOpps. It is anticipated that no further actions will be necessary after award of the IMSC II IDIQ contract, as orders will be issued under fair opportunity in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1) to satisfy this effort.<BR><BR>8.  Market Research:<BR><BR>Market Research was conducted via synopsis on August 22, 2008, as required by FAR 5.201.  No inquiries or comments were received from other sources, nor has there been any interest expressed by other firms to perform these services in the short term.<BR><BR>9.  Interested Sources:  <BR><BR>CORDEV Corporation is currently performing this contract and is the only known source capable of performing at the current levels while maintaining continuity of services through 31 March 2009.  The notice required by FAR 5.201 will be published 22 August 2008, and any proposals or inquiries received shall be considered.  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in performing the six month interim contracts that will transition to the IMSC II IDIQ contract.  <BR>

<DESC><p>The 565 CBSS / GBLB located at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is issuing the attached "draft" Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) to obtain industry input toward the acquisition and sustainment of the Versatile Depot Automated Test Station (VDATS). It is the intent of the Government to award a five to ten year Performance Based Acquisition (PBA) contract for this effort.
<p>There is potential that this effort may be set aside for small business. However, significant on-going market research by the Government will be the deciding factor.</p>
<p>The VDATS was developed organically by the Air Force to support multiple weapon systems. This tester is designed to eventually replace most of the legacy testers currently in use by the Air Force depots.</p>
<p>In order to expand our market research, an Industry Day will be hosted at Robins AFB, GA, in the Air Force Museum, beginning July 28, 2008 and ending July 30, 2008. During this time, interested sources will have the opportunity to pose questions and provide input into the requirement development. In addition, the Government will use this Industry Day as a means of gauging the availability of qualified commercial sources. Since our organic maintenance capability will largely depend on the availability of the VDATS, the Government intends to utilize a rigorous source selection process to ensure award is ultimately made to the source that offers the best value to the Government. Of utmost importance is demonstrated experience to: 1) build similar automatic test equipment (ATE) to include acquiring parts, assembly and testing; 2) support similar ATE through the management of multiple suppliers, supply chain integration, and in-house technical capability.</p>
<p>Industry representatives should be prepared to discuss execution risks associated with the PBWS, and any appropriate best commercial practices that could be incorporated into the strategy. The Government will also lead a discussion on risks and the general source selection criteria anticipated. To finalize the Industry Day dialogue and collection of ideas, scheduled times will be allotted for one-on-one discussions as requested by each contractor in attendance.</p>
<p>All reservations for this event must be made starting July 9, 2008 and no later than July 14, 2008. Please contact the Industry POC at Linda.Ralston@robins.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Directorate of Contracting (DOC), Fort Campbell, KY, has a follow-on requirement for replacement of two rotary screw type air compressors and three breathing air filtration systems as required by OSHA for paint booths.  The only known source qualified to meet the Governments requirement is IDG USA, LLC  without extended interruption of service for system modification.  Replacement includes removal and installation of  air compressors and breathing air purifiers configured match up to existing piping and electric drops.   The procurement will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The Agency intends to enter into a firm-fixed-price, supply-type contract with IDG USA, LLC  located in Nashville, Tennessee.  The basis for restricting competition is that IDG USA, LLC supplied and installed the original breathing air systems and is believed to be the only source who can replace components compatible with the original installation piping and electrical drops.  Further, To procure from another source would involve substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays as other vendors would be required to obtain engineering specifications to modify industry standards in order to manufacture equipment that will match up to the existing facilities.   NAICS code for this procurement is 423830 and the small business size standard is 100 employees.  This sole source requirement will be procured under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition, and awarded on an unrestricted basis.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS and solicitation will not be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 7 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  See Numbered Note 22.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiation with IDG USA, LLC  .  Responses are due by 29 August 2008, 2:00 p.m. (CST).  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to the following address:  dennis.bertrand@us.army.mil  or faxed responses will be accepted at (270) 798-7855.  Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC><p>Proposed addition of Password Protected, USB Flash Drive, 32GB and Encrypted USB Flash Drive, 32GB to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.</p>
<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Password Protected, USB Flash Drive, 32GB and Encrypted USB Flash Drive, 32GB by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L). You can view the P/L on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the P/L to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2014<br />7520-00-NIB-2015</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration/Federal Supply Service, Office Supply Center, New York, NY<br /><br />Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Password Protected, USB Flash Drive, 32GB and Encrypted USB Flash Drive, 32GB to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>EDGDM-214944-PE<br />CMFUSBSRVR-32GB<br />EKMMD32GC250<br />CMFUSB2.0-32GB<br />FB32G</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Password Protected, USB Flash Drive, 32GB and Encrypted USB Flash Drive, 32GB to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than September 12, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<CONTACT>Holly T Carr, Phone (703) 605-5588, Email holly.carr@gsa.gov - FTP User, Email noreply@fbo.gov
<DESC>This serves as a Notice of Intent to award a sole source delivery order open market to Zycus, to provide annual software maintenance for the General Services Administration Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) for FSS Programs.  GSA/FAS OCIO plans to negotiate with Zycus to purchase this Model Maintenance software license as a commercial item.  The total estimated price of $224,740 includes maintenance of AutoClass Batch 1.5x @ $124,740.00 and Autoclass maintenance @ $100,000.  General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) operates GSA Advantage, Virtual IT Market Place (VITM), Air Force Advantage, Veterans Affairs (VA) Advantage, and the Department of Agriculture USDA Advantage applications, critical to the operation of the GSA Schedules program.  Included within these web-based systems is the ability to assign over 10 million products, a UNSPSC code.  The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code provides an open, global multi-sector standard for efficient, accurate classification of products and services.  These codes are then used to sort and present, accurate results to customers when searching for products and services.  The original Zycus software license, which currently supports this cataloging capability was purchased in September, 2003 off GSA Schedule.  This purchase was conducted in direct response to a GAO report, which cited the need to improve the search capability.  Since implementation, a need has arisen for an additional Zycus model maintenance capability.  It will allow GSA to continue its on-going product and service classifications, and improve the accuracy of displaying the correct search results to customers.  The use of UNSPSC will also provide a rich data set for GSA initiatives such as Strategic Sourcing and Spend Analysis.  The increase in Sales for GSA Advantage from FY07 to FY08 was significant.  Implementing categorization for GSA Advantage! played the largest part in this increase as customers are finding the products they need much faster.    Continued increase in usage is anticipated, and the model management software will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current operation.  Zycus model maintenance software is not currently available on GSA Schedule.  Therefore, it shall be purchased from the open market from Zycus.  It is not possible to solicit offers from numerous potential sources because the Zycus software is proprietary and can be obtained from only one vendor.  Because the office of the Chief Information Officer has already determined that Zycus meets current operating needs, there is no requirement to incur additional costs (such as procurement, installation, programming, test, and deployment costs) to convert to a new environment.  The software runs on Sun Hardware with Sun Solaris as the Operating System.  Any attempt to migrate to another hardware or software platform would incur integration, implementation, life cycle, service and support costs--not presently required as long as the current environment remains in effect. The period of performance is delivery of the software in 30 days and maintenance upgrades for one base year, with three, one-year option periods to be exercised at the Governments discretion [FAR 52.232-19, Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, applicable].  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

AIRBORNE TACTICAL IMAGING SENSORS STANDARDIZATION

The Naval Air Systems Command Patuxent River, MD is seeking industry participation in an effort to standardize interfaces between electo-optic systems and their host platforms (i.e. system level interfaces only). The goal of this effort is to improve the affordability and interoperability of electro-optic sensors on Naval Aviation platforms by establishing a common, standard interface for their acquisition, development, integration, test, and operation. This initiative is expected to reduce acquisition and O&S costs and further promote and enable open architecture objectives.

The genesis of this need is the high cost of acquiring and integrating these sensor systems onto Navy aircraft and making the sensors interoperable with the net-centric fleet. Standardized interfaces offer an opportunity to dramatically reduce the life cycle costs related to design, development, production, testing, integration, maintenance, and operation of electo-optic system.  Furthermore, standardization might be a means to simplify the process of Electro-Optical and Infrared Sensor upgrades or spirals.

Recognizing that industry is a critical source of information to identify those interfaces that hold the greatest promise of providing advantages to both industry and the Navy, the Naval Air Systems Command intends to hold an Industry Day to initiate the exploration of this subject with the intended goal of producing a standard(s) to address the most promising interfaces.  We are seeking participation and responses from sensor vendors as well as platform integrators in the exploration and development of standard interfaces for Electro Optical and Infrared System Interfaces.

To this end we would like to solicit Industrys participation in this endeavor, initially via responses to the following questions and in the near future via participation in an industry day to be held at the Patuxent River NAS.

This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

This announcement is neither a Request for Quote nor a Request for Proposal. The Government does not intend to pay for any information submitted in response to this synopsis.  Sensor information and related data are to be shipped to the Naval Air Systems Command contracts office no later than 15 days after the post date of this synopsis. Interested sources should send  data to NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER AIRCRAFT DIVISION (NAWCAD) Code 2.5.1.4., Bldg 441, 29183 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, MD  20670-1463.  Written responses should be received no later than 15 days after the date of this synopsis and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents. Interested sources shall state company size. Please address all technical questions to Vicente Mahoney, Vicente.Mahoney@navy.mil.  Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected where so designated. This synopsis does not commit the Government to awarding a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

Responders to this RFI will form the basis for invitation to the follow on Industry Day. Companies represented at the Industry Day will form the basis for invitations to participate in follow on Sensor Interface Working Group(s)

The Naval Air Systems Command would appreciate responses to the following questions:

What broad areas of interfaces (mechanical, electrical power, electrical signal, thermal, optical, command and control, Data (including metadata), ) does industry see as most promising for standardization? Provide Rationale

To what extent, and in what capacity, have you engaged in Electro Optical and Infrared system standardization and open architecture process in the past?

Can you identify other technology areas where the development of interface standards were beneficial and show the similarities for sensor systems?

What pitfalls does industry see to standardizing EO and IR sensor interfaces?

What future technology insertions may benefit from having an interface standard?

What areas for dialog would industry most like to see taking place with the government on the issue of sensor interface standards?

Please describe your business base in airborne active and/or passive electro-optic sensor systems.

How much software and hardware reuse do you have across your product lines? Is any of this reuse derived from external or internal standardized interfaces?

Do you have a technology roadmap for your product lines? Would you share this with the government?

Do your systems produce data to NGA standards? If so, which ones?

Do you see areas where Electro-optic sensor interface standards exist but are not applied uniformly or consistently across the services?

Where and how do you see a win-win situation between the Navys need for affordable sensor systems (facilitated by interface standard(s)) and industrys need for profitability?

Do you believe that effective and significant sensor interface standards can be developed by Government/Industry Working Group(s) in a non-proprietary environment?

Besides the technical issues, what do you see as the logistical, programmatic, and financial issues that will need to be overcome to achieve electro-optic sensor interface standards that can significantly reduce the cost to the Government of acquiring, integrating, and maintaining electro-optic sensor systems on airborne platforms?

What issues need to be addressed to insure adequate participation of industry in the process of developing electro-optic sensor interface standards?

Standoff Explosive Countermeasure Technologies for 
Detection of Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices

DESCRIPTION

The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS-S&T), Explosives Division, will be conducting operational field demonstrations of remotely-operated and standoff explosive countermeasure technologies to address the threat from suicide bomber, leave-behind, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs).  DHS-S&Ts Standoff Technology Integration Demonstration Program (STIDP) is a multi-year program (concluding in 2013) designed to accelerate the development of standoff explosives detection technologies, concept of operations, and training to counter these threats. The ultimate goal of the program is to prevent explosive attacks at large public events (LPEs) via a spiral development approach. 

STIDP seeks to obtain information on remotely-operated and standoff explosive detection technologies and system integration strategies that have the ability to detect unique signatures that could be attributed to the components of a VBIED.  The purpose of this Request for Information is to identify:

1) Interested parties with existing technologies to detect VBIED signatures who wish to participate in a field test to evaluate VBIED countermeasure architectures.  . 

2) Companies with unique concepts for detection of VBIED signatures. Of particular interest are technical solutions that could detect one or more VBIED signatures by integrating two or more emerging technologies. 

REQUIREMENTS

The following represent the minimum technology requirements for existing VBIED technologies to be considered as a candidate technology for the STIDP:

-	Screen vehicles from a standoff distance or, at a minimum, be remotely operated. For purposes of this solicitation, standoff is defined as the ability to screen an individual or vehicle beyond the lethal blast zone of an explosive device. Technologies solely for use at checkpoints will only be considered if they can be operated unmanned. For example, chemical analysis and/or forensics using a manual wipe-down trace detection method will not be of interest.
-	Detect one or more VBIED signatures:
o	While the vehicle is stationary or moving
o	With occupants inside or outside the vehicle 
-	Operate in
o	a temperature range of 0-120 F
o	the presence of fog, rain, or snow
o	day or night
-	Can be operated as a real-time countermeasure by law enforcement personnel with less than 1 day training
-	Screen a wide range of: 
1)	privately operated vehicles (e.g., cars, minivans, pickups, SUVs and light trucks such as pickups, panel trucks, light vans, panel vans),  
OR 
2)  medium-duty trucks (e.g., RVs and box, platform, and flatbed trucks), AND
heavy-duty trucks (e.g., concrete, dump, garbage, and refrigerated trucks, busses, and tractor-trailers, including ISO containers and tankers).

Signatures

DHS is looking for technologies that could detect one or more of the following VBIED signatures in a remote or standoff screening mode:
-	Trace or residual levels of explosives on the external surfaces of the vehicle (e.g., door handles, trunk, etc.)
-	Trace or residual levels of explosives on the internal surfaces of the vehicle (e.g., steering wheel, radio, etc.)
-	Explosive or taggant vapor emissions from the vehicle, inside the vehicle, or occupants, etc.
-	Bulk quantities of explosives, fragmentation, accelerants (e.g., propane tanks), or detonation systems inside the vehicle
-	Excessive or unusual vehicle loading
-	Anomalous vehicle performance characteristics/dynamics (e.g. response to pre-placed road obstructions, e.g., speed bumps)
-	Anomalous vehicle behavior (stopping vehicle for no clear purpose, abandoned vehicles, etc.)
-	Anomalous driver behavior (e.g. abandoning vehicle, lack of passengers when expected, driver nervousness or sweating, etc.).
-	Electronic signatures emanating from the vehicle.

Desirable Technology Capabilities

The following list represents technology capabilities that are desirable to DHS S&T, but not actual requirements at this time:
-	Operation with vehicle speeds in excess of 5 mph
-	Integration of sensor systems that detect orthogonal attributes to increase probability of detection and reduction of false alarms
-	Do not require infrastructure modifications, are self-powered, or can communicate wirelessly to a command station
-	Minimal manpower requirements (less is better)
-	Easily configured for change in location, orientation, venue, and targeted objects
-	Mobile technologies
-	Technologies with small footprints
-	Technologies with open interfaces or are easily integrated into other 3rd party architectures (preferably open architectures).
-	

DEMONSTRATION SCHEDULE

The STIDP is planning on conducting a field demonstration of VBIED countermeasure for summer/fall, 2009. The primary intent of the field demonstration is to test a VBIED countermeasure architecture to determine system and individual sensor technical performance, integration approaches, and concept of operations effectiveness in a live, operational environment.

<DESC>It is anticipated that this will be a SOLE-SOURCE procurement resulting in a SOLE-SOURCE contract to be awarded to the Cascadia Center for Regional Developmenthereinafter sometimes referred to as Cascadia, or as the Center.

Under this procurement, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) plans to award, on a SOLE-SOURCE basis, one and only one contract (which will probably be numbered as DTOS59-09-C-00402) to the Cascadia Center for Regional Development, for a project entitled Cascadia Center Congestion Pricing Outreach Activities.  It is estimated that the Federal price of that contract will be $200,000, and the contract will help to satisfy agency requirements to meet the congestion pricing analytical and outreach activities needed in support of DOTs Congestion Initiative.

A description of the work to be performed under the contract is given below, followed by a statement of the reasons why DOT believes that the contract must be awarded, on a SOLE-SOURCE basis, to the Cascadia Center for Regional Development.

Description of the Proposed Sole-Source Project

In an effort to expand the implementation and acceptance of direct roadway pricing throughout the United States, DOTs Office of Transportation Policy seeks to develop new avenues and messages for effectively communicating the compelling benefits of road pricing on highway performance.  The Cascadia Center for Regional Development in Seattle, funded largely by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to provide innovative transportation leadership in the Pacific Northwest, is uniquely qualified to implement this important outreach activity.  The Centers ongoing partnerships with opinion leaders in the public and private sectors of the Puget Sound area and other communities of the Pacific Northwest are key to helping DOT implement congestion pricing and related congestion relief strategies.

Under the contemplated project, the Center would perform the following four tasks:

Task 1.   The Center would document the congestion relief aspects of the Transportation Technology (Trans Tech) Conference to be held in September of 2008 on the campus of the Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Washington.  The conference will be sponsored by Microsoft and additional public and private organizations.  DOT does not intend to reimburse the Center for the costs of organizing and facilitating the Trans Tech Conference.  The Trans Tech Conference will engage local leaders and national experts to refine and communicate concepts and strategies for the implementation of congestion reduction techniques such as road pricing, bus rapid transit, improved and more efficiently priced parking facilities, active traffic management, and other technology applications designed to relieve urban traffic congestion.  

Under Task 1, the Center would prepare a report summarizing the congestion relief aspects of the aforementioned conference, and would submit that report to DOT with two (2) months after the effective date of the contract.     

Task 2.  The Center would direct an ongoing media relations program to publicize the results of the Trans Tech Conference and other congestion pricing outreach activities, as well as the results from actual congestion pricing activities occurring throughout the United States, including the recently implemented dynamic pricing of State Route 167 in the State of Washington.  

Under Task 2, the Center would prepare a documented compilation of published news reports and similar accounts covering Cascadia-coordinated events on the topic of congestion pricing and related congestion relief activities.  The documentation would cover public acceptance of congestion pricing and related strategies.  The Center would submit that documented compilation to DOT within six months after the effective date of the contract.  

Task 3.  The Center would coordinate meetings attend by DOTs Office of Transportation Policy, other DOT Staff, and private sector officials in the Pacific Northwest working on advanced software, communications, and other technologies.  Such meetings would further the goals of DOT with regard to congestion pricing and related congestion relief strategies.

The Center would prepare a summary of the meetings held under Task 3, and would submit that summary to DOT within two months after the effective date of the contract and every two months thereafter.

Task 4.  The Center would prepare a final report summarizing:  (a) the lessons learned from the various outreach activities described in tasks 1, 2, and 3; and (b) actual pricing experience in the United States.  The report should emphasize the capacity and performance improvements that result from user fees that vary with the level of traffic.  That report would be submitted to DOT within eleven months after the effective date of the contract.

Circumstances Supporting a Sole-Source Contract Award to the Cascadia Center for Regional Development

Since the 1990s, Cascadia Center activities have helped to highlight and publicize the link between road pricing policies and efficient transportation system performance in seminars, workshops, and conferences.  The Center is intimately familiar with the issues and has unique relationships with key public and private sector officials who are positioned to educate the public about this important policy issue.  Cascadias efforts and experience have helped to support the progress already made by metropolitan Seattle in regional traffic management and in optimizing the areas flow of people and goods.  Seattles willingness to successfully pursue and enter into an Urban Partnership Agreement with the US DOT on June 20, 2008, reflects, in part, these educative, collaborative, and promotional efforts.   

The Seattle (Lake Washington) Urban Partnership Agreement is a cooperative agreement to employ innovative traffic management tools for improving traffic flow along State Route 520 and Interstate 90 between Seattle and the Eastside. The agreement calls for a new variable tolling system that could improve traffic flow on the SR 520 corridor and provide up to $500 million to replace the aging SR 520 Lake Washington floating bridge. 

Cascadia is uniquely qualified and situated to communicate the compelling importance of road pricing and to create new and expanded regional communication partnerships with opinion leaders in both the public and private sectorsefforts which are central to the sole-source project here envisioned.  

Because of the Centers long experience in performing precursor work related to the project here proposed, and because of the extensive network of professional and local governmental contacts which the Center has developed and cultivated in the Seattle area in the performance of that previous work, the Center alone is capable of performing this new project at the high level of quality and within the ambitious time-frames and in the rigorous level of detail indispensable to DOT.

Ifdespite the existence of the above-mentioned factual basis logically identifying the Cascadia Center for Regional Development as the only organization capable of satisfactorily performing the new contract numbered DTOS59-09-C-00402 as envisioned hereinany organization OTHER THAN Cascadia believes that it can perform this new project at the very high level of quality needed by DOT, then any such other organization shall E-MAIL a complete Statement of Qualifications to james.mowery@dot.gov and to jack.bennett@dot.gov not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time, September 22, 2008.  Faxed and telephonically transmitted Statements of Qualifications will NOT be accepted.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(Addendum to Block 18b. ) WIDE AREA WORKFLOW RECEIPTS AND ACCEPTANCE (WAWF-RA)</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The Department of Defense (DoD) initiated WAWF-RA to eliminate paper transactions from the contracting process. The purpose of WAWF-RA is to enable vendors and government officials to electronically access and process the documentation needed to generate payment for goods and services. Once your computer is set-up, registration, and training are completed, invoices will be created and processed in WAWF-RA. WAWF-RA is mandated by DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clause 252.232-7003 "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests", dated January 2004, which is incorporated in this purchase order. The following information will help you get started.</p>
<p>Setting Up Your Computer<br />To set up your computer go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink on the left-hand side of the page entitled "About WAWF-RA". An expanded list will appear. Select "Setting Up Your Machine". This page will list all computer, software, and security requirements. All necessary programs can be downloaded from this page. Your computer must be configured properly to use WAWF-RA. Once your computer is set up you may proceed to the registration process.</p>
<p>Registration<br />For help with the registration process go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink "Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA" in the center of your screen. On the next page go towards the bottom and select the hyperlink under the "Vendors" section. Be sure to list an Electronic Business Point of Contact in the Central Contractor Registry. This information must be current to process an invoice in WAWF-RA and can be updated by going to www.ccr.gov. Once you are ready to register go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink "Self Register to use WAWF-RA (New users)*" then follow the directions. Upon activation of your account, usually within 2 business days, you will receive notification via email. Prior to logging on to WAWF-RA, users are strongly encouraged to complete the computer-based training.</p>
<p>Training<br />Training can be accessed by going to http://www.wawftraining.com/. Be sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements listed on this page. Users must register prior to starting the training. This registration is separate from the registration process for the WAWF-RA system. Be aware that this computer-based training is made for all users of WAWF-RA, not just vendors, so be sure to focus on the vendor portion of the training. Once training is completed users may begin to use the system.</p>
<p>Invoice Processing<br />When creating an invoice, be sure to select the "Invoice and Receiving Report Combo" document type, not the "Invoice" or "Invoice as 2 in 1 (Services Only) type. For construction contract the following must be attached: Contract Progress report Af Form 3065, HAZMAT usage report and Construction contract debris report. Once the proper document type is selected, you will be asked to indicate the location for inspection and acceptance. Both must be coded as "Destination."</p>

However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.</p>

<p>PART I - PRICE PROPOSAL</p>
<p>Insert proposed unit and extended prices in the Pricing Schedule. The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price multiplied by the number of units. The proposal(s) must be submitted for a base year plus two (2) Option Years.</p>

<p>Past Performance Surveys (Attachment 2): The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than three (3), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three years. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price and Past Performance. Past performance is apporoximately equal to Price when being evaluated. The Contractor will send Attachment 2, Past and Present Performance Survey to companies for which they've done similar work. The past performance shall be assessed based on the ratings mentioned in Attachment 2 (Exceptional, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, Unsatisfactory, and Neutral). The questionnaire must come from the referenced companies; forms will not be considered if received from the offeror. <br />(b) Options: The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>1. Security Requirements. Travis Air Force Base is designated as a closed base. In order to promote security and safety, all contractors desiring access must adhere to installation entry requirements, to include, criminal background history (CBH) checks, National Crime Information Center (NCIC) wants/warrants checks and California Law Enforcement Telecommunication System (CLETS) driver license history checks. A CBH check is not required for contractors if they have a current favorable government security clearance which can be verified through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). Contractors are divided into two categories to ensure proper screening and to minimize installation access delays as follows:</p>
<p>&#61607; Category 1 (Cat-1) contractors are the primary and some sub-contractors who are identified against a contract prior to the contract performance start date.<br />&#61607; Category 2 (Cat-2) sub-contractors and affiliate workers not previously identified against a contract prior to the contract performance start date.</p>
<p>Contractors will ensure all Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors possess proper credentials allowing them to work in the United States. Additionally, contractors will ensure illegal aliens are not employed and/or transported onto the installation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation for delays or expenses associated with complying with the provision of this clause. Furthermore, nothing in this clause shall excuse the contractor from proceeding with the contract as required.</p>
<p>2. Criminal Background Checks. Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors whose criminal background meets any of the following 12 disqualifiers will not be allowed installation access. All Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors will be adjudicated based on the following disqualifying base access criteria:</p>
<p>&#61607; U.S. citizenship, immigration status, or social security account number cannot be verified.<br />&#61607; Barred from entry/access to any military installation or facility.<br />&#61607; Wanted by federal or civil law enforcement authorities, regardless of offense or violation.<br />&#61607; Name appears on any federal agency's list for criminal behavior or terrorist activity.<br />&#61607; Convicted of espionage, sabotage, treason or terrorism. <br />&#61607; Incarcerated for 12 months or longer within the past three years, regardless of offense or violation.<br />&#61607; Convicted of a firearms or explosives violation within the past three years.<br />&#61607; Convicted of illegal possession or use of drugs/narcotics on more than one occasion within five years from the date access to Travis AFB is requested.<br />&#61607; Convicted of an offense involving drug trafficking, possession with intent to sell or drug distribution within 10 years from the date access to Travis AFB is requested.<br />&#61607; Convicted of a felony involving violence against a person, arson, robbery or burglary within five years from the date access to Travis AFB is requested.<br />&#61607; Required to register as a sex offender under federal law or the applicable state law.<br />&#61607; Convicted of any crime involving indecent acts with a minor or a felony that is sexual in nature.</p>
<p>Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors adjudicated and cleared under the disqualifying criteria are considered cleared for installation access for a two-year period regardless of the number or length of contract; thereafter, a renewal is required. During the two-year period, Pass and Registration or the Visitor Control Center will perform random samplings of CBH, NCIC wants/warrants and CLETS driver license history checks of contractors already cleared.</p>
<p>Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors with disqualifying base access information will be issued a barment letter immediately revoking their base access privileges. Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors requesting to contest the adjudication, barment, or requesting a waiver/exception to policy must submit a written rebuttal/request within 10 business days of receipt of the barment letter to 60 AMW/CC, through 60 SFS/CC, Attention: 60 SFS/S5R, Bldg 381, 540 Airlift Drive, Suite C-101, Travis AFB 94535-2451.</p>
<p>3. Primary Contractor Responsibilities. The primary contractor will be responsible for the conduct of all Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors working under that contract. Additionally, the primary contractor will:</p>
<p>Coordinate Cat-1 and Cat-2 base entry requirements with the 60th Contracting Squadron.</p>
<p>Advise Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors requesting base access on requirement to complete, sign and submit a Travis Form 251, Consent for Background Check. Forms are available at Pass and Registration, Visitor Control Center or the AF Portal e-publishing website. Any Cat-1 or Cat-2 contractor who does not complete or sign the form will be denied installation access.</p>
<p>Advise Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors that the badge/pass is only valid for the purpose, person and vehicle for which it was issued. Use of the badge/pass for any other purpose or by any other person will result in the pass being confiscated. Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors that misuse their pass may face revocation of installation access privileges and/or barment actions. If a pass is lost, notify the Pass and Registration Office immediately.</p>
<p>&#61607; To obtain a pass, personnel will need a valid state or government photo identification.<br />&#61607; To obtain a vehicle pass, personnel will need a driver license, registration and insurance.</p>
<p>Provide written notification, within one week, to the 60th Contracting Squadron of any changes in Cat-1 or Cat-2 contractor status. This includes, but is not limited to, the contractor being fired or quitting their position with the company.</p>

<p>Processing Cat-1 Contractors. Provide an EAL (Entry Authority List) of all Cat-1 contractors on company letterhead which require a badge/pass. All requests for a badge/pass will be submitted through the Base Contracting Office NLT 45 days prior to the contract start date. Exceptions will be made for short-notice contracts where the award date and performance start date are less than 45 days. A badge/pass will be issued for a maximum of one year.

<p>When the EAL is submitted, ensure a TAFB Form 251, Consent for Background Check, is attached for each person.</p>
<p>Processing Cat-2 Contractors. Only persons who have undergone a CBH and are clear of disqualifying base access information can serve as a sponsor. Persons appointed as sponsors will meet Cat-2 contractors at the Visitor Control Center, and ensure they complete Travis Form 251, Consent for Background Check.</p>
<p>4. Lost Badges/Passes. The supervisor of Cat-1 and Cat-2 contractors will investigate and provide written notification for a lost badge/pass to the 60th Contracting Squadron. Written notification should include an explanation from the contractor on how, when, where and what steps have been taken to locate the missing badge/pass. If a replacement is needed, forward the notification with the request for a badge/pass.</p>

<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One Base Year and Four Option Years</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Luanda, Angola</p>
<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE: NACI (Non-sensitive)</p>
<p>AREA OF CONSIDERATION: United States Citizens and residents and third country nationals. Citizens and permanent residents of the host country are not eligible for this position.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Major Duties of this position include:</p>
<p>The incumbent Strategic Information (SI) Advisor with expertise in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) provides in-country assistance to establish and implement standardized program evaluation, and reporting for HIV/AIDS activities for both USG team and other key partners. Incumbent is responsible for strengthening M&amp;E systems and capacity among United States Government (USG) agencies (CDC, USAID, DOD, DOS), partners, and the Government of Angola (GOA) at both implementer and national levels. Incumbent also is responsible for developing and managing systems to measure the progress towards targets set for the USG President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and its contribution to the national response to HIV/AIDS in Angola.</p>
<p>The Strategic Information Advisor advises the USG team on all matters related to the measurement of USG's contribution toward achieving the PEPFAR targets. Incumbent is responsible for translating M&amp;E and other Strategic Information (SI) into improved Emergency Plan (EP) programming and delivery of services. Additionally, incumbent strengthens systems of accountability for use of EP resources, contributes to a single national M&amp;E system in Angola, and strengthens systems and capacity among partners to collect, manage, and use quality M&amp;E data. Incumbent also facilitates the work of SI Team members in country (Surveillance, M&amp;E, and Health Monitoring and Information Systems (HMIS, EPI Data Manager,) to ensure SI/M&amp;E requirements of the EP are met on a timely basis (e.g., target setting for the Country Operational Plan [COP]; activity development for SI program areas of the COP, semi-annual progress report, etc.). Incumbent coordinates responses to ad hoc SI requests from the Office of the United States Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), the USG team in-country and CDC/Atlanta.</p>
<p>Incumbent works closely with CDC/GAP/Angola, USAID/Angola, the Angolan National Institute of Public Health (INSP in Portuguese), the Angolan National Institute to Fight HIV/AIDS (INLS in Portuguese), Global Fund Angola, WHO Angola, etc. and the Brazilian south-to-south collaboration, to establish and implement standardized program management, evaluation and reporting practices for HIV/AIDS activities in Angola.</p>
<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Incumbent is closely involved with the development of the annual Country Operational Plan (COP). As such, s/he has an opportunity to contribute to long-term strategic planning for CDC/GAP Angola and PEPFAR. This plan will include provisions for staffing six positions: Team Leader; HIV/AIDS Specialist; Surveillance Officer; Data Manager; Project Officer. The M&amp;E Officer will be expected to provide input on staffing for results requirements in the Strategic Information sector. This may include suggestions on increased staffing in the sector or recommendations on expanding the roles and responsibilities of existing M&amp;E staff.</p>
<p>This position supervises two staff members:<br />1) Surveillance Specialist <br />2) Epi Data Manager</p>
<p>Incumbent manages four people involved in the execution of CDC and Emergency Plan-funded Strategic Information activities. This management does not constitute formal supervision of staff employed by partner organizations or others. Rather, as the focal point for the collection of CDC and Emergency Plan-mandated data, the incumbent will be responsible for ensuring that people employed by partners receiving CDC or Emergency Plan funds are aware of reporting deadlines and guidelines for submitting data.</p>
<p>As above, incumbent is responsible for ensuring that two contractors employed by partner organizations or USG agencies in country are aware of reporting deadlines and guidelines for submitting data.</p>
<p>Incumbent is required to provide relevant training in CDC and Emergency Plan reporting guidelines, requirements and regulations to 15 staff members at partner organizations. Training will also be provided on methods used in the collection and use of Strategic Information (M&amp;E, surveillance data). This training may also be provided to new staff at USG agencies, as needed.</p>
<p>As the focal point for the collection and dissemination of Strategic Information data for CDC/USG and Emergency Plan reports, the incumbent serves as a team leader during periods preceding reporting deadlines. As the team leader, incumbent is expected to communicate daily with 15 partner organizations' staff members and other USG agencies to ensure that all required data are submitted and processed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The incumbent will be provided with all of the equipment necessary to perform the duties outlined in this position description. This will include, but not be limited to, a personal computer (PC) with all relevant software and hardware installed (e.g., MS Office, Ethernet connection), connection to a broadband internet server, access to the CDC/GAP intranet, access to the CDC Citrix server, a fax machine, a photocopier, digital scanner, a desk and an ergonomic desk chair. The equipment described in this section will be used in the execution of the incumbent's official duties.<br />Estimated value US$5,000</p>
<p>All expendable supplies will be provided by the CDC/GAP Angola office. The incumbent may request additional expendable supplies, as needed, through the CDC/GAP Angola administrative assistant.<br />Estimated value of supplies US$5,000 annually.</p>
<p>Incumbent is responsible for maintaining print and electronic archives on Strategic Information activities (reporting indicators, surveillance data, etc.) each year. The M&amp;E officer will also maintain files on relevant Health Management Information Systems (HMIS), surveillance, and Monitoring and Evaluation Resource Group (MERG) activities. These data will be filed in a manner that information can be accessed quickly and easily on any given indicator or for any partner.</p>
<p>The CDC/GAP Angola Chief of Party exercises overall supervisory control over the development of incumbent's annual workplan. The execution of the annual workplan (i.e., the incumbent's daily work) is supervised by the CDC/GAP Angola Chief of Party; however, incumbent has significant independence to execute the duties described in this position description. This independence includes the freedom to liaise (communicate regularly) with partners and other USG agencies without prior consent from the supervisor. As the resident expert in Strategic Information activities and the USG guidelines governing these activities, incumbent also has considerable freedom to make decisions related to the collection, compilation, and analysis of required indicator data. Incumbent also is free to veto the actions of others when those actions would contradict or run counter to established guidelines governing the collection, compilation, analysis and/or dissemination of these data.</p>
<p>Incumbent has broad discretion to resolve problems/situations encountered in conjunction with the duties described for this position. Examples of this discretion may include:<br />1. Providing direct technical support to partners on issues related to the collection and/or transmission of Strategic Information (indicators, surveillance data). This support may include (but not be limited to) training on data collection guidelines, use of data collection forms and, where relevant, electronic data collection/ management systems (e.g., COPRS, HMIS). Incumbent also provides technical training to partners on the need for M&amp;E and other Strategic Information activities and the use of data collected through these activities.<br />2. Providing or obtaining clarification on the meaning of indicators. This may include determining and communicating the intent of individual reporting indicators. Incumbent is expected to make these determinations in conjunction with senior M&amp;E colleagues at CDC/Atlanta and/or the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator. Works with partners, including the Ministry of Health, to explain and ensure compliance with CDC clearance requirements for evaluations and operational research projects.<br />3. Incumbent works with partners to establish or facilitate an alternate reporting mechanism. For instance, if a partner is unable to file data electronically, incumbent assists the partner to file those data via an alternative method (e.g., telephone, fax). When data is received in a non-electronic manner, incumbent is responsible for ensuring the data are appropriately loaded into the electronic system.</p>
<p>Incumbent is not required to control the overall management and/or implementation of projects. Rather, incumbent's principal responsibilities focuses on overseeing and facilitating partners' implementation of Strategic Information activities described in the annual Country Operations Plan. Incumbent's responsibilities are focused on ensuring each project and partner complies with the reporting requirements outlined in their CDC or PEPFAR funding agreement. Incumbent also asserts control over the development and implementation of Strategic Information (M&amp;E, surveillance) training activities with partners and responds to requests for technical assistance.</p>
<p>Incumbent's overall impact is on the Country Operation Plan for the country. The total country PEPFAR budget is US$7,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Incumbent provides oversight of six USG member technical support persons to various projects/programs undertaken by PEPFAR and, when necessary, solicits appropriate human and financial resources. <br />Incumbent leads the inter-agency SI team consisting of SI staff across USG agencies. The SI section includes activities funded in Surveillance and Surveys to monitor the epidemic and risk behaviors; Health Management Information Systems, primarily for Government of Angola HIV programs; and Monitoring and Evaluation for support of PEPFAR and its partners. The team conducts strategic planning in collaboration with the Government of Angola and international donors to ensure that PEPFAR SI works in harmony with these partners.</p>
<p>As a member of the CDC/GAP Angola program's technical staff, incumbent provides input to the program's annual Country Operational Plan (COP) on questions related to Strategic Information (monitoring and evaluation and associated data collection and reporting activities, e.g., surveillance). Since Strategic Information is an evolving field, it may reasonably be expected that incumbent will be asked to contribute to and implement new developments in policies and procedures related to M&amp;E and surveillance. Because of the importance of reporting in all CDC and PEPFAR activities, these changes will impact the overall operations of CDC/Angola's programs and those of the agency's partners.</p>
<p>As noted elsewhere, incumbent is the primary point of contact for all CDC and PEPFAR funded partners for questions involving the collection and dissemination of Strategic Information data (including, but not limited to, required indicators, surveillance). Incumbent provides specific and relevant advice and recommendations to others inside and outside of the CDC/GAP Angola office. This advice will include information on changes to reporting requirements, updates on reporting guidelines, and assistance to partners experiencing technical difficulties collecting or transmitting required data. Incumbent also coordinates technical assistance from CDC headquarters in response to requests for such assistance from partners.</p>
<p>Incumbent provides regular progress reports to the CDC/GAP/Angola/Director/Chief of Party. These progress reports -- on partner activities -- allow the director to assess the overall direction of CDC and PEPFAR activities in Angola and to make changes to the strategic plan, as necessary. Without these progress reports, the program would be unable to identify problems and institute mid-course corrections. The frequency of these reports will be determined by incumbent's supervisor.</p>
<p>Incumbent provides a mission critical link among CDC and PEPFAR-funded partners and the U.S. Government. Incumbent's importance may best be expressed by indicating what would happen in the absence of this position: Funding to partners is incumbent on the partners' meeting pre-determined reporting requirements and deadlines. Without incumbent to oversee the timely and appropriate collection and dissemination of these data, partners would risk losing funding from CDC and/or PEPFAR. More importantly, gaps in the collection of Strategic Information data would prevent the USG from evaluating the impact of PEPFAR funds and identifying areas where policy or programmatic changes may be required.</p>
<p><br />Knowledge:</p>
<p>Essential</p>
<p>All applicants should have demonstrable professional experience with monitoring and evaluation or a related field of data collection and dissemination (e.g., surveillance).<br />Extensive knowledge of the principles, concepts, methods and techniques of public health to analyze, evaluate and provide expert advice and consultation to the PEPFAR office; strong knowledge of the methods, applications, and state-of-the art technology to provide direction and guidance on critical and complex issues for the country team.</p>

<p>Desired</p>
<p>Knowledge of CDC and USG operations and regulations is beneficial, but not required. All applicants must, however, be familiar with the overall goals and objectives of the CDC, the Global AIDS Program and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.</p>
<p>A working knowledge of Angola's geography and post-independence history is desired.</p>
<p>Level 3 fluency in Portuguese (written and spoken) is desirable.<br />Familiarity with statistical software (e.g., SAS, SPSS) is desired but not required.</p>
<p><br />Intellectual Skills:</p>
<p>Incumbent works in a highly detailed and complex information environment. As the focal point for Strategic Information data from CDC and PEPFAR partners, incumbent is required to understand and apply all CDC and PEPFAR data collection and reporting guidelines. Incumbent also must have strong knowledge, skills and abilities in the field of epidemiological surveillance (especially as it applies to HIV/AIDS). Please note that reporting guidelines are updated on a routine basis. Incumbent is expected to keep up with changes in the reporting guidelines and communicate these changes to partners, as needed. Likewise, incumbent is expected to stay current with developments in the field of surveillance.</p>
<p>Incumbent is expected to perform complex analyses of data submitted by CDC and PEPFAR partners in Angola. These analyses are quantitative and qualitative in nature, as required for the annual and semi-annual reports, the Country Operational Plan (COP) and evaluations and operational research. Incumbent is required to adapt to changing guidelines for processing these data, and communicate these changes in a clear and timely manner to affected partners.</p>
<p>Typical problems incumbent will face and be required to solve include: Partners that do not understand reporting requirements; unclear reporting requirements that require clarification by incumbent. The most difficult problems incumbent will face will involve partners who encounter difficulties collecting or filing data by a reporting deadline. In these situations, incumbent is expected to work quickly and accurately under significant time constraints.</p>
<p>As noted elsewhere, incumbent contributes to the development of the Country Operational Plan (COP), an annual document that outlines the program goals and objectives for the fiscal year. Incumbent contributes to COP sections involving monitoring and evaluation activities. Incumbent also advises the CDC/GAP Angola country director (and other senior CDC/Atlanta/USG technical staff) on monitoring and evaluation issues as they may pertain to the development of long-term strategic planning documents.</p>
<p>The Strategic Information field is relatively young and is constantly evolving. Incumbent is expected to keep abreast of new developments and innovations in the field. S/he also is expected to contribute new ideas, when appropriate, and adapt new techniques and ideas as required by CDC and/or PEPFAR.</p>
<p><br />Communications:</p>
<p>Given the small size of the CDC/GAP Angola office, incumbent will have direct internal contact with all members of the program, from the country director to the janitorial staff. The nature of communications will vary depending on the conversation, but will range from routine administrative contacts to high level conversations about programs and data. Incumbent is expected to approach key internal contacts (chief of party, deputy director for operations) and communicate mission critical information to them in a timely and clear manner. On occasion, incumbent also is expected to communicate mission critical information in person to country directors for other USG agencies, as well as senior staff at the U.S. Embassy.<br />As the key point of contact for Strategic Information, incumbent must maintain constant contact with external partners and serve as CDC technical liaison on relevant panels and committees (e.g., the Monitoring and Evaluation Resource Group). These contacts include communication with high- and mid-level representatives of partner organizations, pertaining to the sharing of information on guidelines for monitoring and evaluation, support for the collection and submission of required indicator data, and oversight of evaluations and operational research supported by PEPFAR.</p>
<p>As noted above, incumbent must be able to communicate highly technical information to senior staff in the USG team as well as with partner organizations. Complex explanations must be presented clearly and concisely, and incumbent must be able to restate the same information from different angles. This ability may be essential for partners who do not grasp the initial explanation of a new and complex set of guidelines or data. Incumbent also, on occasion, is required to convey the policies, practices, and accomplishments of CDC/GAP Angola and PEPFAR in public appearances (e.g., conferences). As the team leader for data collection and reporting, Incumbent also is required to mediate between partners and CDC HQ and the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator on differences of opinion regarding monitoring and evaluation practices or protocols. Tact, diplomacy and patience are required in these situations.</p>
<p>Incumbent must be able to communicate in writing at the highest level. Written work includes contributions to the annual Country Operational Plan, annual and semi-annual reports, as well as training materials and articles for publication, as assigned by incumbent's supervisor. Incumbent also is expected to produce high-level presentation slides, including information collected during the most recent reporting cycle. These presentations must be of sufficient quality to be viewed by senior members of the U.S. mission in Angola, senior leadership at CDC/GAP headquarters in Atlanta, senior staff at the Departments of State and Health and Human Services in Washington, DC, as well as by audiences at domestic and international conferences.</p>
<p><br />Working Environment:</p>
<p>Primary Location: Luanda, Angola.<br />Incumbent may be required to travel within Angola to perform site visits to partner organizations funded by CDC and/PEPFAR.</p>
<p>Angola is a developing country with poor ground transportation networks (especially in the interior where travel requires four-wheel-drive vehicles) and a weak internal air network. Hazards associated with domestic ground or air transportation will be similar to those found in other developing countries.</p>
<p>This position is largely sedentary, requiring long hours seated in an office environment while working on a PC. Physical demands will be minimal. Incumbent will be informed of the risk of repetitive strain injuries due to excessive typing and will be advised of ways to minimize this risk. Incumbent also is expected to absorb any physical discomfort associated with travel to the interior of Angola. This may include long periods in a four-wheel-drive vehicle on unpaved roads, flights on small charter aircraft and river trips on open boats, etc.</p>
<p>The majority of the work associated with this position will be done in Angola's capital city, Luanda. Some travel -- with unusual work patterns and work away from the primary duty station -- may be required throughout the course of each year.</p>
<p><br />Benefits/Allowances:</p>
<p>Overseas allowances and differentials similar to those available to U.S. Government employees assigned abroad may be payable under this PSC, subject to eligibility. Actual benefits may vary from one candidate to the next and/or from one country of assignment to the next. A summary of the overseas allowances and differentials available to U.S. Government employees assigned abroad may be found at the following</p>
<p>Internet URL: http://aoprals.state.gov/ Specific benefit, allowance, and differential information will be provided in the "Offer of PSC Employment" letter sent to the successful applicant.</p>
<p>Additionally, country specific information useful for U.S. Government employees assigned abroad may be obtained from Department of State available at the following Internet URL: http://www.state.gov/m/fsi/tc/c10391.htm and Travel Warnings concerning certain countries, in <br />many of which CDC conducts its international program activities, may be obtained at the following Internet URL: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html.</p>

<p>CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS <br /><br />(a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance <br />Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails. <br />(b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.<br /><br />(c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be unilaterally terminated by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.<br /><br />(d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program. The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.</p>
<p>SOCIAL SECURITY, FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND FOREIGN EARNED INCOME <br /><br />(a) Since the contractor is an employee, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br /><br />(b) As an employee, the contractor is not eligible for the 'foreign earned income' exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911- 3(c)(3)).</p>
<p>INSURANCE<br /><br />(a) Worker's Compensation Benefits. The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br /><br />(b) Health and Life Insurance.<br /><br />(1) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br /><br />(2) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of annual life insurance not to exceed $500.00 per year.<br /><br />(3) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.<br /><br />(4) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br /><br />(5) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this provision.</p>

<p>Non U.S. citizens will not qualify for health unit access during the period of performance of the resultant contract and, if a contract is offered, will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtains coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/health/health_1185.html. CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider.

CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. In order for CDC to reimburse the cost of medevac insurance, CDC shall require the contractor to furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders and its cost, after issuance of an offer letter.</p>

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement and Factor 2  Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a go on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offerors past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.

Factor 2  Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541611, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is a total small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for professional services to maintain and improve Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) functioning by working with individuals and small groups to promote personal and professional growth and productivity, productive interpersonal relationships, and organizational morale.  The Statement of Work is as follows:


Objective:

CFSANs mission is critical to the well being of U.S. consumers and, indirectly, consumers world-wide.  This mission often involves shifting priorities, grappling with difficult and controversial scientific questions, and solving urgent, complex problems within short timeframes, typically under intense public scrutiny.  It is essential that CFSAN operations, both short- and long-term, function as smoothly as possible at all levels and under conditions that can involve considerable stress to employees.  In addition to sound organizational structure, issues relating to morale and good functioning can arise at the individual and small group level, with effects that can adversely affect organizational functioning if not identified early and addressed in a manner that benefits both the individuals and the organization.   

Scope of Work:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, and services and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work as described below.

The contractor shall work closely with the Director of CFSAN, the CFSAN Deputy Directors, other members of the CFSAN Senior Leadership Team, the CFSAN Management Council, other CFSAN managers, supervisors, and personnel, as situations warrant.  

At the request of CFSAN management, and on the basis of its own observations, the contractor shall evaluate the nature of problems affecting behavior and the ability to function, primarily involving individuals and/or small groups that, if not addressed, could adversely affect, or is already adversely affecting, the ability of individuals or small groups to perform in a manner that is beneficial to the organization as a whole.  Some issues requiring evaluation and intervention may involve matters not yet known to management.  Under such circumstances, the evaluation would likely arise from information coming to the attention of the contractor because of the contractors ability to engender trust at all levels of the organization.    

Such evaluations shall occur largely through interviews with individuals and small groups although they could also involve the facilitation of meetings.  Depending upon the situation and the nature of the request, the evaluation may result in recommendations and advice to management on a course of action best designed to resolve the problem(s). To the extent possible, recommendations may take into account a familiarity with individuals, organizational dynamics, and organizational culture, and with the range of remedies available to management.  
As circumstances dictate, the contractor may participate in implementing the recommendation(s) described above, primarily through interviews, counseling, and coaching that may be either short- or long-term, and meeting facilitations.   
 
At the judgment of the contractor, the contractor may intervene on its own initiative, without an initial request from management, with interviews, counseling, and coaching when, in the judgment of the contractor, such intervention is warranted or when such intervention is requested by an individual.  This judgment may be based on the contractors observations as well as knowledge of individuals and circumstances within CFSAN.  

Coaching and counseling by the contractor may involve, but is not limited to: career development, establishing goals, considering issues confronting CFSAN, resolving personal issues that could affect work capabilities, the development of legacies, the exploration of ideas and solutions, the dynamics of leadership, the management of conflict, alienation and isolation, and the consideration of other points of view.

In addition to the above activities, the contractor may, at the request of CFSAN management, facilitate meetings and conduct organizational assessments or assessments of various activities and ongoing programs in order to make recommendations for changes that will improve working relationships and morale.  

This project involves resolving conflicts between individuals and among groups and work units; the facilitation of meetings so as to respectfully include differing points of view; intervention with difficult personnel; reduction of alienation, isolation and demoralization that can undercut productivity; and the management of emotions that damage on-the-job performance and well being.  Another important component of this project is coaching executives and other officials in how to consider their roles in resolving broad issues that confront CFSAN, including issues that may have roots in CFSANs organizational history and in the history of relationships among people at CFSAN.   

The work involved is dependent on the contractors knowledge and understanding of CFSAN, including its structure, history, and personnel.  The awardee must have the ability to engender trust at all levels within an organization in order to be able to intervene successfully at the individual and small group level within the organization and to be able to obtain sensitive information on behalf of management.  

Reporting Requirements/Deliverables:

The contractor shall provide a quarterly report on consultations, related meetings and progress with individuals or small groups.  Reports should adhere to principles of confidentiality and privacy.

EVALUATION FOR AWARD

Basis for Award:

a.       Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost.  Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.

b.       Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price.  It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.

c.       FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government.  FDAs acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror.  Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offerors technical solution is evaluated.  This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the governments assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is being issued in conjunction with FAR part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as applicable. The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-08-000895. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-541690- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services; Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.

The Food and Drug Administration has a requirement for the following:   

I. Background:  
The mission of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is to assure that safe and effective drugs are available to the American people.  CDER promotes, protects and enhances the health of the public through drug development, evaluation and continued safety monitoring throughout the drug life cycle.  To accomplish its mission CDER must contend with many important challenges. Failure rates in clinical development have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades.  FDAs Critical Path Initiative (CPI) seeks to identify and address scientific and technical obstacles to optimize the development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  Under the Critical Path Initiative (CPI), FDA is trying to identify innovative ways to enhance drug development and reduce the time it takes to bring therapeutically important and safer medical products to the market by leveraging prior knowledge.

To date, recombinant and purified cytokines have fallen short of their promise as therapies.   Despite outstanding therapeutic promise and sound scientific rationale, most cytokine therapies have failed to establish clinical utility. The FDA seeks to establish a forum for joint discussions with the biopharmaceutical industry to facilitate product development for unmet medical needs in the context of the agencys Critical Path Initiative.   

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum to discuss the successes and failures of recombinant cytokines as therapeutic agents for treating human diseases, including cancer and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.  This conference will provide a forum to review the scientific and clinical basis of both successful and unsuccessful attempts to develop cytokines as therapeutic agents.  It will also provide a forum to develop strategies to increase the probability of clinical success of recombinant cytokines as therapeutic agents in future clinical trials.  

The meeting is designed as a forum to critically assess the factors that are limiting the clinical development of cytokines as therapeutic agents.  The FDA anticipates participation by scientists and clinicians from other federal agencies (e.g., NIH, NIST), the biopharmaceutical industry, academic institutions, consortia that may contribute to future clinical trials (e.g., Biomarker/Genomic Consortia) and others to actively participate in this unique conference.  The overall goal of the workshop is to identify areas for improvement and to coordinate, develop and disseminate novel approaches to current scientific hurdles that are impairing the development of cytokine products.


II. Objective: 

FDA wishes to collaborate on the development of a scientific workshop to address the role of cytokines as therapeutic agents.

III. Scope of Work:  

The Contractor shall work within and/or develop any necessary elements to produce the following two (2) deliverables within a twelve month (12) period.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 
OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) 
(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within the active performance period; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. 
(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. 
(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed September 30, 2011.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension

Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.24 per hour computed on the
basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or

(See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as
numbered):

1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any
employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or
professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer
System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than
$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour
would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage
rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those
job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate
for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates
that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour
conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an
individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope
of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which
this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for
that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures
described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or
explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance
operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All
operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at

site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the June 12, 2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-26.  This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and no additional written solicitation WILL be issued.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting on behalf of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Social Security Administration, and HHS Office on Disability, to negotiate on a sole source basis with the World Health Organization (WHO), Avenue Appia 20, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.  The contractor will provide NLM with at least once-yearly updates to the English versions of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, 1st Edition (ICF) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, Children and Youth, 1st Edition (ICF-CY).  In addition, the contractor will provide NLM with the right to use ICF and ICF-CY within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLMs production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute ICF and ICF-CY, within the UMLS Metathesaurus, free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical purposes.  ICF is a unified and standard language and framework for the description of the health and health-related states of an individual or community.  A derived classification, ICF-CY was developed to address the needs of child and adolescent health programs.  While traditional diagnostic coding such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is used to describe causes of impairments, the ICF and the ICF-CY are classifications that describe the impact of the impairments, taking into consideration contextual and environmental factors.  WHO developed and owns the intellectual property rights of both ICF and ICF-CY.  The ICF was approved by the World Health Assembly in 2001 for use in member countries in research, surveillance and reporting and as complementary to the ICD.  In 2006, ICF was adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative for the functioning and disability domains with the recommended that it be incorporated within the NLM UMLS as a necessary first step toward ensuring maximal utilization of the ICF in electronic formats.

All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  NLM Synopsis No. NLM-08-195-UHP.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NFFKPR00-8-45815 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is set aside for Small Business. The associated NAICS code and small business size standard is 541611 and $6.5M. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Marine Mammal Conservation Division has a requirement to continue the project that is currently underway for two of the six regions (Southeast and Southwest Region). A third party (non-governmental organization) will conduct a survey of stranding network members for the purposes of achieving high quality, substantive feedback from the Stranding Network (Phase 1). This will involve using the 2008 OMB approved survey form (NOAA Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Survey). In addition, the contractor will analyze results from the survey to assist NMFS management with identifying core issues and preparing meaningful agendas for the external reviews (Phase 2). The contractor shall provide necessary personnel, material, equipment, and all other items necessary to completely perform the requirements specified in this statement of work. Prior to conducting the surveys, the contractor shall meet with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and other applicable NMFS staff to discuss the statement of work. The contractor shall be required to provide the COTR with informal verbal progress reports as frequently as deemed necessary by the COTR. Survey of stakeholders - NOAA Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Survey - To achieve high-quality feedback from stakeholders, the contractor will complete Phase 1 described above using the OMB approved survey developed in 2008. This approach will ensure that respondents are buffered from influences by agency staff, and eliminate any potential conflicts of interest. A combination of two or more evaluative tools may be used (e.g. phone surveys, mail surveys, personal interviews). The contractor will also conduct personal interviews of a small subset of stakeholders. All qualitative analyses for personal interviews will follow traditional methods for qualitative research and all responses from individuals will remain confidential. Participants in surveys and interviews will be selected from the following stakeholder groups for both regions: (1) Stranding Network members (Stranding Agreement holders, Designees); (2) academic institutions; (3) selected NOAA Fisheries employees and (4) other selected Federal and State employees (109h). Sample size - The contractor should ensure that the survey design and implementation will adequately represent all key stakeholders. While NMFS expects that this would likely require an overall 75% response rate for each region Northeast, Northwest Regions (NER, NWR), NMFS expects to rely on the contractor's expertise in identifying an appropriate response rate that is representative of the stranding networks and is statistically valid. The NWR has thirty eight organizations authorized to respond to marine mammal stranding events. The majority of these are non-governmental organizations (n=12) but also include academic institutions (n=3), and federal/state agencies under 109h authority (n=23). The NER has 15 active stranding organizations and the majority are non-governmental organizations (n = 9) and two academic institutions and four 109h federal/state agencies. It is important to note there are often multiple perspectives within one organization. Therefore, it is essential for the contractor to design sampling methods that will adequately represent views among the Network, and within Network member organizations. Final Report and Presentations - Prior to the external review (Phase 2), the contractor will prepare a final report summarizing results of the surveys in both Regions. This Report will also include separate analyses for each region and identify common overlapping or unique issues to each region. The contractor will also present these results at each Region's external review meeting. The contractor shall be responsible for: 1) Designing and conducting surveys and interviews. The contractor shall work closely with NMFS staff in the NER, NWR, and our headquarters office to design review the survey questions and identify participants for interviews and surveys. The contractor will be responsible for contacting participants and all costs associated with conducting the survey, conducting phone interviews and receiving feedback. 2) Analyzing results. The contractor shall analyze all results using statistical analysis or qualitative analyses. 3) Generating a Final Report. The contractor shall complete a Final Report of survey results including an executive summary, methodologies, copies of survey instruments, an overall summary, and a summary of overlapping themes or common issues to each Region, as well as unique issues to each region. 4) Presentations of results at two external review meetings. The contractor shall present results from the survey and the Final Report at the NER external review and the NWR external review meetings. Deliverables: The contractor shall provide the following deliverables to NOAA: 1) Survey results and Report Fall 2009 and 2) A Power Point Presentation for external review meetings summarizing results in the Winter 2010. The period of performance is Date of Award through September 30, 2011. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price. The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Outstanding (O) - Conspicuously striking in eminence; Good (G) - Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Adequate (A) - Reasonably sufficient and suitable; Marginal (M) - Minimally suitable at the lower limit.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NFFKPR00-8-43515 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541940 and business size is $6.5. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Marine Mammal Conservation Division is required to determine the health and health trends of marine mammal populations in the wild including developing sampling regimes, standardized protocols and evaluating the causes or contributors to health impacts. This is currently being addressed in small projects and without a long term study design to guide the collections. Specifically, the collection of these types of health data and environmental data is mandated under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Given limited resources for collection, storage and analyses, the Marine Mammal Health Stranding Response Program (MMHSRP) needs epidemiologically appropriate sampling designs for die-off investigations, banking and real time monitoring to address trends to do cause - effect analyses. This work must be done in collaboration with the health and stranding partner(s) and must utilize existing unpublished data for the development of a prospective plan as well as evaluating causality. This work will be used to guide evaluations and to reduce waste in resources. The contractor shall provide the following: 1) Evaluating of causality: Design a case study to assess the role of herpes, contaminants and genetic factors in the risk of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) developing adenocarcinoma. Carcinomas comprise approximately 18% of the cause of death in stranded adult California sea lions examined by the Marine Mammal Center (TMMC), Sausalito. Herpes virus is highly associated with these lesions and animals have higher blubber contaminant concentrations than animals dying of trauma after controlling for confounding factors. New studies have also identified genetic markers that may be associated with this disease. For this study the contractor would design a robust case-control study to determine the relative contribution and risk of disease occurrence with and without these three cofactors (herpes, high blubber contaminants and genetic markers). The contractor would work closely with TMMC staff to identify which cases at TMMC have complete datasets and identify missing cases, particularly deciding on appropriate matched controls. An initial desk study would determine the power to detect significant relative risk differences (usually taken as odds ratios &gt;2) given various sample sizes and study designs (control matched vs. unmatched). This study design would then be used to determine the cost and requirements to complete the dataset in order for this approach to be carried out. 2) Establishing sampling regime for future evaluations: Determining appropriate sample sizes to estimate disease prevalence or establish common disease diagnosis for known diseases of wild marine mammals. The question that is often asked of biometricians and NMFS is "how many samples do I need to collect?" The appropriate study design or sampling regime is related to the variability in the parameter of interest within the population from which the samples are drawn and the degree of uncertainty that the investigator or NMFS is willing to accept. There are many generic packages that can carry out these so called power calculations but the MMHSRP requires a dedicated package that can be used by non-specialists to answer three main questions: 1) How many serology or PCR samples would be required to determine the prevalence of a disease in a given population/; 2) During an Unusual Mortality Event how many animals would need to be tested for presence of infectious agents or biotoxins to be sure that the diagnosis by gross pathology or clinical examination is sufficient to determine the true cause of disease?; 3) For archiving samples from a population during an outbreak (or mortality event) or as baselines (i.e., mass strandings), how many samples must be archived to be representative of the event or group involved in the event or to determine trends in a given population? Deliverables: 1). Project One: Adenocarcinoma in sea lions - a) The contractor will provide a robust case control study; b) The contractor will provide a desk based study to determine data gaps and identify appropriate controls; c) The contractor will provide an analysis of the cost and requirements to complete the dataset for the evaluation - 2. Project Two: Sampling designs: a) The contractor would provide user-friendly software with appropriate user manual and documentation that would calculate the number of samples required given different scenarios by the user; b) The contractor would provide a generic decision tree for the UME/outbreak/mass stranding situation as the appropriate approach is likely to be disease-dependent; c) The contractor would provide a generic decision tree for archiving samples from various animals in given situations; d) The contractor will provide beta testing using UME personnel; e) The contractor will provide training through in person meeting and webx for network users. The resulting purchase order shall be awarded on a best value basis and negotiated on a firm fixed price basis. Period of Performance: Date of Award through May 31, 2010. Award is anticipated by September 22, 2008. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price.

The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has oversight responsibility for the licensing of operating research and test reactors (RTRs).  Within NRR, the staff within the RTRs Branches of the Division of Policy and Rulemaking performs most functions associated with the regulation of RTRs. These efforts take the facility from initial licensing through transition to decommissioning status.  Three major oversight responsibilities for operating RTRs are program management, inspection, and operator licensing.

The NRC conducts internal training for its staff that provides classroom instruction in RTR reactor designs, facilities, equipment, operating characteristics, technical specifications, inspection requirements, and current areas of concern to the NRC.  However, the NRC does not have the ability to provide training that involves hands-on experience or observation of actual/simulated RTR reactor behavior.  

This contract will serve as a pilot program.  Based on the success of this pilot program, the NRC may procure additional training depending on staff needs.

The objective of this contract is to acquire expert technical assistance to provide a four (4)-day training course tailored for NRC staff, including preparing training materials and to conduct the training, in RTR reactor theory with hands-on RTR facility and laboratory experiment experience.  The training will be conducted at the contractors RTR facility.

(End of provision) 
The provision 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items applies to this acquisition as follows:
 
EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
a. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
Sub-factor 1: The Government will evaluate the technical capability of the item offered to determine the vendors ability to provide the product meeting the USCG specifications. Vendors shall provide sufficient and detailed related information to clearly demonstrate the vendors capability to provide products meeting these specifications. 
b. RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Relevant past performance includes three (03) years experience in manufacturing and maintenance support of Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS).

Vendors shall complete the designated section of the Contract Data Sheets (Enclosure 1) for up to three of their most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) in which the vendor built and supplied an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS). The Contractor shall forward the Contract Data Sheet to the contract specialist listed on the document with the offeror. The Contractor is NOT to fill out the questionnaire section of the Data Sheet. The questions provided are typical of but no limited to type of questions will be asked of the past performance source. If the vendor does not have any Federal Government contracts, then list state, local, or commercial contracts, in that order. Responses shall be brief and concise. Data submitted other than that requested on the Contract Data Sheets will not be considered.  Failure to submit Contract Data Sheets shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for the Government to evaluate. A vendors lack of relevant past performance will be rated as neutral. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those listed in the vendor's proposal.

c. PRICE: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Vendors shall provide their total proposed price to meet the requirements outline in the specifications. 

Basis of Award: This order shall be awarded to the vendor determined to represent the best value to the United States Coast Guard. Overall technical approach is considered to be more important than past performance; however, technical approach and past performance combined are more important than price. As the technical evaluation scores converge, price may become more important. 

 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The provision 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items applies to this acquisition as follows:
 
EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
a. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
Sub-factor 1: The Government will evaluate the technical capability of the item offered to determine the vendors ability to provide the product meeting the USCG specifications. Vendors shall provide sufficient and detailed related information to clearly demonstrate the vendors capability to provide products meeting these specifications. 

b. RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Relevant past performance includes three (03) years experience in manufacturing and maintenance support of Global Navigation Satellite System Simulators.

Vendors shall complete the designated section of the Contract Data Sheets (Enclosure 1) for up to three of their most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) in which the vendor built and supplied Global Navigation Satellite System Simulator and Interference Simulation System capability.  The Contractor shall forward the Contract Data Sheet to the contract specialist listed on the document with the offeror. The Contractor is NOT to fill out the questionnaire section of the Data Sheet. The questions provided are typical of but no limited to type of questions will be asked of the past performance source. If the vendor does not have any Federal Government contracts, then list state, local, or commercial contracts, in that order. Responses shall be brief and concise. Data submitted other than that requested on the Contract Data Sheets will not be considered.  Failure to submit Contract Data Sheets shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for the Government to evaluate. A vendors lack of relevant past performance will be rated as neutral. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those listed in the vendor's proposal.

c. PRICE: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Vendors shall provide their total proposed price to meet the requirements outline in the specifications. 

Basis of Award: This order shall be awarded to the vendor determined to represent the best value to the United States Coast Guard. Overall technical approach is considered to be more important than past performance; however, technical approach and past performance combined are more important than price. As the technical evaluation scores converge, price may become more important. 

 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
(End of provision)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-66RD25 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 337127. The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.

COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>The NCI - Office of Acquisition has received questions regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation.  Please see below.


QUESTION: I wanted to understand a specific component of the scope of work in NCI solicitation number  RFQNCI80108NG01  Ghana Prostate Study.  Specifically the tasks for the study include a step Conduct interviews using the forms provided by NCI. 

It is labeled as a medical abstraction form  a summary of each case that is part of the study.  

Answer:  Both in-person interview and medical record abstraction will be conducted, using the forms developed by NCI.  

QUESTION:  I would like to understand NCIs approach to data collection involving interviews/surveys in support of clinical research.  In this project the survey instrument is previously developed.  While that makes for effective controls on cross study data comparison, there are site specific factors that may require modification to the survey. 
The questionnaire has been developed and used in part of the study, so there will be no changes to this tool. 

I didnt understand the scope of work to include what done with the survey data once it is collected  the specimens yes, but not the survey data.  Is there someone in the program office that I could speak with to understand how the data is entered into a case system for analysis and if that is part of the scope of this project or if that is work performed in Bethesda? 

Answer:  The data will be entered in Ghana twice (for accuracy) and then transferred to NCI.  Statistical analysis will be carried out at NCI.

Darnall Army Medical Hospital, Hood Texas. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clauses can be viewed by accessing website http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. FAR provision 52.212-1 [Instructions to Offerors  Commercial] applies to this acquisition to include the following addenda:  All offerors are cautioned that if selected for award, they must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) program.  The CCR can be accessed via the internet at www.ccr.gov/. Confirmation of CCR registration will be validated prior to awarding a contract. Evaluation Factors: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. 1. Technical Capability; Explain how your company will meet the scope of work paragraphs A.1.1 through a.1.5. NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires from Two (2) firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If an Offeror provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing sate and time., the Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the offerors. 3. Price. 4. Award will be all or none basis. Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability. Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance. Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will it be necessary to replace the piping and telemetry system when replacing the Liquid Nitrogen Tank?</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Assume all piping and the telemetry system shall be changed to accommodate for the new tank. This shall ensure the compatibility of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will liquid nitrogen product to initially fill the tank be required?</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes. Once installed, it would be necessary to fill the tank with liquid nitrogen to test the installation and start up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will the vendor be responsible for providing a backup for users during the time of removal and installation of the liquid nitrogen tank?</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary to provide a backup during replacement of the tank. USUHS will be able to provide their own backup at that time.</p>

<DESC><p>The 565 CBSS / GBLB located at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is issuing the attached "draft" Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) to obtain industry input toward the acquisition and sustainment of the Versatile Depot Automated Test Station (VDATS). It is the intent of the Government to award a five to ten year Performance Based Acquisition (PBA) contract for this effort.
<p>There is potential that this effort may be set aside for small business. However, significant on-going market research by the Government will be the deciding factor.</p>
<p>The VDATS was developed organically by the Air Force to support multiple weapon systems. This tester is designed to eventually replace most of the legacy testers currently in use by the Air Force depots.</p>
<p>In order to expand our market research, an Industry Day will be hosted at Robins AFB, GA, in the Air Force Museum, beginning July 29, 2008 and ending July 30, 2008. During this time, interested sources will have the opportunity to pose questions and provide input into the requirement development. In addition, the Government will use this Industry Day as a means of gauging the availability of qualified commercial sources. Since our organic maintenance capability will largely depend on the availability of the VDATS, the Government intends to utilize a rigorous source selection process to ensure award is ultimately made to the source that offers the best value to the Government. Of utmost importance is demonstrated experience to: 1) build similar automatic test equipment (ATE) to include acquiring parts, assembly and testing; 2) support similar ATE through the management of multiple suppliers, supply chain integration, and in-house technical capability.</p>
<p>Industry representatives should be prepared to discuss execution risks associated with the PBWS, and any appropriate best commercial practices that could be incorporated into the strategy. The Government will also lead a discussion on risks and the general source selection criteria anticipated. To finalize the Industry Day dialogue and collection of ideas, scheduled times will be allotted for one-on-one discussions as requested by each contractor in attendance.</p>
<p>All reservations for this event must be made starting July 9, 2008 and no later than July 14, 2008. Please contact the Industry POC at Linda.Ralston@robins.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>As a result of the VDATS Industry Day announcement, there has been an overwhelming response from industry. Originally, the second day was set aside for one-on-one exchanges with individual companies. Based on the number of responses, a second day of one-on-one exchanges is anticipated and the one-on-one exchanges will change from 25 minute sessions and will be limited to 15 minute sessions for question exchanges between the companies and the government. Companies interested in providing company information can leave brochures, briefing charts, white papers, etc. for the team to review. In addition, if any companies are considering partnering with one of the other companies attending the industry day and would mutually agree to a combined one-on-one session, please include that information in response to this notification. It is important to utilize the limited time available and to maximize the information attained for the benefit of the procurement.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Planning note for one-on-one exchange appointments:</strong> Wednesday one-on-one exchanges will be held at the museum; however, Thursday one-on-one exchanges will be held at a location on base. If you are a local contractor with access to the base, it would be greatly appreciated if you would schedule a Thursday one-on-one exchange session.</p>
<p><strong>In response to this notification, please provide the following information:<br /></strong>1) Confirmation of participation in one-on-one exchange</p>
<p>2) Notification of partnership/combination of one-on-one exchanges with another contractor</p>
<p>Please provide this information to <strong>Linda Ralston via e-mail at Linda.Ralston@robins.af.mil no later than 3:30PM EST on 18 July 2008.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contemplates awarding, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the storage and rotation of pediatric vaccines to be used as a national stockpile. CDC has purchased vaccines under a separate supply contract or delivery order, and the Contractor shall provide storage of the same at Contractor furnished sites. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the government's best interest due to the fact that Wyeth is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and rotate the vaccines that they manufacture. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible qualified&nbsp;business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. Additional quantities of vaccines acquired under preceding or succeeding separate supply contracts or delivery orders may be added to the stockpile by modification to this contract. Material will be held at the contractor furnished storage site for subsequent delivery as required by the contract. The storage site shall be located at one or more domestic facility (i.e.) that is/are controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall only store the product in filled, labeled, ready-to-use containers in the stockpile. CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Gary Morgan at gmorgan1@cdc.gov. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued, approximately within 15 days. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.

<DESC>The previous solicitation is amended as follows:

Reference Number:	NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-218-1 /DDC

Title:	 Meeting and Lodging Facility


The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA) has a requirement for Office of Education, The Division of Intramural Research (DIR) for services of a Hotel facility to accommodate one hundred forty attendees for a  meeting to be held April 2, 2009 through April 3, 2009.   This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 721110 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million.

The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-218 / DDC.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

The basic objective of this retreat is to provide an intensive training experience for NHLBI fellows in research presentation skills and networking.  This training will be accomplished in three different formats. The first is through oral presentations.  Selected fellows will present their research to those in attendance, and receive feedback on their research as well as their oral presentation skills. Other fellows will present their research in poster format. This is the major format at most scientific meetings. They will learn to present their research one-on-one to those attendants who visit their poster as well as to the poster judges, normally NHLBI investigators.  Finally, we will have several presentations from invited speakers who are leaders in their field who will provide valuable information as well as the opportunity to network with our fellows.  Other activities at the retreat are designed for increasing networking and team building amongst the NHLBI fellows in attendance.   

B.  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:

 
The Office of Education, Division of Intramural Research, will hold its 7th annual retreat for the NHLBI Post-Doctoral Fellows on April 2 -3, 2009.  The retreat will provide the post-doctoral fellows with training in research presentation skills and provide career development opportunities.  The purpose of this procurement is to request approval for a retreat location closer to the NIH that will still be able to provide sleeping rooms and meals for 125-150 NHLBI Fellows, a room for plenary sessions, break out rooms for discussions, and space for 30 poster boards for abstract presentations. 

C.  CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor will provide sleeping rooms and meals for 125 -150 NHLBI Fellows, a room for general (plenary) sessions (theater style), 2 break out rooms to accommodate 40 each for discussions, and space for 30 poster boards for abstract presentations.  To ensure a high attendance rate, the Contractor must be located 50 miles or less from the NIH Campus, to allow the participants a shorter drive and to return home to families if they so choose. 

D.  GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES:

The NHLBI will be responsible for providing the appropriate funding to the contractor. The NHLBI will pay for all meals, sleeping rooms, meeting space, and refreshments via a government purchase order.

<DESC><p>This notification modification provides answers to questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI), following the guidance therein. The date for receipt of responses to this RFI remains unchanged at 9:00am EST, June 2, 2008.
<p>NITAAC would like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation for the interest shown in this requirement and the responses provided.</p>
<p>1. Question:<br />When does the government anticipate acquisition planning to take place regarding CIO-SPNEW?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The acquisition planning is already taking place through the use of this RFI. After evaluating responses to the RFI, the government will develop a business case to the Office of Management and Budget. Upon approval, the government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) at that time.</p>
<p>2. Question:<br />When does the government anticipate issuing an RFP? The RFI indicates a potential RFP release date of June 2008 for CIO-SP3. Can the government confirm this approximate date?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government intends to issue an RFP as soon as possible, pending government approvals; however, the government will invest the time necessary to create an RFP that meets the needs of the customers, anticipate new technology over the next ten years, provide a quick and easy to use contracting vehicle for customers, provide fair opportunity to industry, and promote maximum participation of small and small disadvantaged business.</p>
<p>3. Question:<br />Has any press release been made to advertise the RFI to the public?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>4. Question:<br />Can the GWAC be written as a hybrid contract to go beyond only IT?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>5. Question:<br />What are the Clinger-Cohen restrictions on the contract?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The contract scope must be information technology and designed to serve the needs of federal agencies.</p>
<p>6. Question:<br />Has a final decision been made about combining CIO-SP2i and IW2nd?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No. The government is looking to industry for pros and cons regarding the combination of these two GWACs. Please refer to question 5.1.1:</p>
<p>5.1.1 Currently, NIH is obtaining these services under two separate GWACs, the CIO-SP2i and IW2nd. Considering how imaging is being integrated throughout other IT systems, NIH is planning on combining these two contracts into one. Please describe any advantages or disadvantages and whether imaging should be a separate functional area in the contract or integrated with the other functional areas.</p>
<p>7. Question:<br />What influence, if any, will the RFI responses have on the RFP release and the ultimate award of CIO-SPNEW? For example, will RFI responses be scored in any manner?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />Responses to RFIs have no bearing on the evaluation of any individual future proposal responses to the planned RFI. Responses will not be scored, but will provide input into the RFP planning process.</p>
<p>8. Question:<br />Will RFI responses be utilized or considered as part of a down-select process?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>9. Question:<br />Is there an industry day coming?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />There is no industry day planned in relation to the RFI.</p>
<p>10. Question:<br />Can the government please provide specifics for what the RFP process will involve?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government will follow the normal process provided for in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. As stated in the RFI, the government will use the response from the RFI in helping develop the Statement of Work and acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>11. Question:<br />The existing CIO-SP2i contract is a Task Order service contract and the existing IW2nd contract includes Task Orders and Solutions and Services as well as Delivery Orders for products. If it is the government's intention to combine these two contracts into one, does the government envision that the contract will have both Task Orders and Delivery Orders?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government is considering various options as to the structure if these two contracts are combined and welcomes any suggestions.</p>
<p>12. Question:<br />If the new contract will have both Task Orders and Delivery Orders, will the products be segregated as a separate CLIN or Task Area?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />The government is considering various options and welcomes any suggestions.</p>
<p>13. Question:<br />Would primes all be required to bid products on the contract?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This decision will be made after consideration of all options.</p>
<p>14. Question:<br />Can the government describe the process for issuing orders under the new contracts?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This is still to be determined. Any suggested refinements to the procedures currently used for the CIO-SP2i and the IW2nd GWACS would be welcome at this point.</p>
<p>15. Question:<br />Would the government identify advantages in using the GWAC over GSA ordering, open market commercial contracts, or other mechanisms available for ordering these services?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />a. Empowers government health providers and CIOs by offering a choice from a large number of pre-qualified vendors<br />b. Reduces costs by streamlining and automating the acquisition of health IT<br />c. Range of contract types and order terms to best suit customer unique needs<br />d. Broad IT scope, but with a focus on supporting research and health missions within the federal government.<br />e. Effective management controls.</p>
<p>16. Question:<br />Would the award strategy allow for a stable of contractors where government customers have the option to limit proposals to small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small business, etc.?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />NITAAC is exploring options to promote small and small disadvantaged businesses including the potential for systematic task order set asides for small and disadvantaged businesses. The RFI is also seeking ideas from industry and from the government as to the best ways of maximizing small and small disadvantaged business participation.</p>
<p>17. Question:<br />What will the invoice payment process be for NIH buyers?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This is still to be determined but will be consistent with the new NIH business system guidelines.</p>
<p>18. Question:<br />What steps are in place to ensure timely payments?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This is still to be determined but will be consistent with the new NIH business system guidelines.</p>
<p>19. Question:<br />Is a potential vendor excluded from receiving the RFP if they don't submit an RFI?</p>
<p>Answer: No. Response to the RFI is strictly optional and voluntary.</p>
<p>20. Question:<br />Is a potential vendor excluded from receiving the answers to the questions if they don't submit a response to the RFI?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>21. Question:<br />Are there any page limitations?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />There is no page limitation to responses to the RFI.</p>
<p>22. Question:<br />Will contractor questions be released so that all interested offerors can review them?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />Questions received in response to the RFI and follow the guidelines therein are being released.</p>
<p>23. Question:<br />In Section 5 - Directed Topics for Reponses, the RFI states, "The government requests vendors respond to the RFI in the order specified in the sections below." None of these sections cover Section 2 - Scope. Because a contractor intends to demonstrate its qualifications in one or more of the "Scope" areas in Section 2, should the contractor include its "Scope" responses after the Section 5 responses, or should the contractor include its "Scope' responses according to the instructions in Section 4 that state, "A statement of qualifications for the firm including a brief description of the firm's quality control processes for deliverables"?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The RFI does not require an extensive demonstration of the contractor's qualifications for the scope areas described. It is only asking for a general description of corporate capabilities, which should be addressed as a response to topic number 3, statement of qualifications.</p>
<p>24. Question:<br />Is the government requesting information in regards to available technology under each Task Area or is it simply requesting contractors to provide responses to Sections 5.1 - 5.6.4.?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The focus of this RFI is to solicit feedback from customers and contractors on the questions is Sections 5.1 - 5.6.4. A general description of a firm's available technology can be included as a response to topic 3, statement of qualifications. This information would be helpful to the evaluation of a response to this RFI, but is not required.</p>
<p>25. Question:<br />Can the government provide clarification on the term "partial qualification"? Paragraph 5.1.9., the government states, "in the interest of attracting capable contractors who specialize in areas of interest to NIH, contractors may be qualified on a subset of the 10 task areas. What does the government envision as the advantages and disadvantages of partial qualification?" Is the government requesting commentary on structuring the vehicle such that vendors bid and subsequently be awarded specific task areas, or that vendors bid and subsequently awarded access to the vehicle based on qualification against a subset of the task areas - however - the vendors are still able to bid tasks across all functional areas, or is the government requesting commentary on both scenarios?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />The government's intention is to qualify contractors by task area. There will be contractors that qualify in all task areas, and there may be contractors that qualify in only one or several of the task areas. Depending on the specific needs of the customer, qualified contractors would choose whether to pursue the individual task orders.</p>
<p>26. Question:<br />Regarding Section 5.5., Security 5.5.2. Please clarify the question, "What risks exist and what mitigation steps can be taken?" What risks exist where and for what, e.g., organization/infrastructure/technology)?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />For health IT, there could be specific risks involved in protecting privacy information, etc. The government is interested in feedback regarding new risks being encountered in this field and the steps taken to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>27. Question:<br />In sections 5.2. and 5.4., the RFI refers to the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). Will the CIO-SP solicitation specify use of the Federal Healthcare Architecture (FHA)?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government is interested in encouraging use of FHA. To what extent FHA is covered in the contract vice an individual task order is an item to be determined.</p>
<p>28. Question:<br />The Department of Health and Human Services has mandated the Troux Metis EA tool for department-wide use. Will the NIH, through the CIO-SP vehicle, be open to use of other EA products and tools?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />EA products and tool requirements would be provided within the scope of specific individual task orders, and not mandated as part of the GWAC contract scope. Other agencies may use this contract for enterprise architecture efforts that involve the use of EA tools other than Metis.</p>
<p>29. Question:<br />If a company's algorithm is proprietary and as such cannot be FIPS 140-2 validated through NIST for non-classified use, would this situation preclude the company's involvement in this project?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No. However, an agency can require FIPS 140-2 validation in an individual task order. In such a case, the vendor will either have to seek validation or risk having its proposal disqualified during the task order source selection process.</p>
<p>30. Question:<br />Because the security questions in Sections 5.5.1. through 5.5.5. are fairly broad and responses can vary quite widely depending upon specific technologies, will the government please elaborate and provide guidance on the specifics and perspective of the information it is hoping to receive in response to these questions?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government is looking at this only in broad terms in order to include the necessary requirements in the RFP.</p>
<p>31. Question:<br />There are several questions regarding Section 5.5. Security that are focused on how information is secured and authenticated on a company's database and during transmission (questions 5.5.2. - 5.5.5.). Is the intent of these questions to understand how the contractors' corporate security policies align with HHS/NIH or is HHS/NIH looking for technical alternatives to their own security policies and practices?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The intent of this question is to understand how the contractors' corporate security policies align with HHS/NIH. NITAAC does not intend to consider alternatives to HHS/NIH policies and procedures except possibly when alternatives are specified by a non-HHS/NIH customer. However, the government will consider including in the RFP the ability for HHS/NIH to consider alternatives and under what circumstances.</p>
<p>32. Question:<br />Does NIH anticipate that the contractor will control or take possession of PHI on behalf of the client?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />We are not clear what is being asked.</p>
<p>33. Question:<br />Does NIH anticipate that the contractor would become a "business associate" as defined by HIPAA regulations?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />If so, the requirement would be included in an individual task order.</p>
<p>34. Question:<br />The difference between Task Area #2 and #3 is not clear. Will the government please provide further guidance on what they expect in each of these areas?</p>
<p>Answer: Task Area #2, Outsourcing, supports the management and operations of government business functions, assuming that they are essentially IT functions. For instance, the outsourcing of an IT support call center would be within scope of Task Area #2. Task Area #3, IT Operations and Maintenance, focuses specifically on the maintenance and operations of computer systems. Work under Task Area #3 is not oriented towards the outsourcing of government function that the computer systems provide, but a more limited outsourcing of the labor required to operate and maintain a system that may be housed within a government facility.</p>
<p>35. Question:<br />Under Task 2, would the government provide further clarification as to what is meant by IT Business Functions?</p>
<p>Answer: IT business functions include any aspect of a government function, as defined in the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model which is performed through the use of information technology.</p>
<p>36. Question:<br />Would the government please provide specific information regarding question 5.5.4., e.g., does this question refer to data and access from laptops, or is the data in an application, or in another location, e.g., an eRoom?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />The government is unclear as to this question.</p>
<p>37. Question:<br />Would the government please clarify sections 5.5.1, 5.5.2, and 5.5.3, e.g., can one assume that the government is interested in receiving a recommendation based on task orders performed at the contractor site rather than at the government site?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />Task orders performed at the contractor site.</p>
<p>38. Question:<br />How is the Small Business plan looking like?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government intends to maximize opportunities for small and small disadvantaged businesses in the upcoming GWAC. In finalizing a small business approach to include in the RFP, the government, through this RFI, is looking to industry for ideas on ways to maximize such opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business. Two pertinent questions in the RFI follow:</p>
<p>5.1.3 To maximize opportunities for small (SB) and small disadvantaged business (SDB), NIH is considering the possibility of having a separate bidding category for task orders that are set aside for SB and SDB. Do you think this is a necessary feature to improve opportunities for small businesses? Are there other ways NIH can improve opportunities for SDBs?</p>
<p>5.1.4 How should NIH best incorporate small business into the sourcing strategy that will provide maximum opportunities for the various small business categories, such as woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, small disadvantaged, HubZone, etc.?</p>
<p>39. Question:<br />Would the government please clarify section 5.1.5? Are you looking for incentives for Large Businesses to meet subcontracting goals, or incentives for Small Disadvantaged Businesses during competition such as a percentage pricing incentive?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />NITAAC is seeking recommendations on ways to maximize opportunities for small business and small disadvantaged business, both at the prime contract level and through subcontracting opportunities.</p>

<DESC><p>NITAAC would like to take this opportunity to thank the many companies that responded to the Request for Information (RFI) regarding the successor Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) to the current CIO-SP2i and IW2nd GWACs.&nbsp; NITAAC appreciates the tremendous time and effort expended in providing this valuable feedback to the government.&nbsp; As stated in the RFI, the government is analyzing the response and is considering the feedback in developing a business case for this effort and in formulating a possible future Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>Until the business case is approved, NITAAC can neither provide any definitive timeframe for the solicitation process nor any further information about the requirement.&nbsp; However, should the business case be approved and NITAAC goes forward with an RFP, NITAAC will want to award the new GWAC in enough time to allow for a smooth transition from the current contracts that expire in December 2010 to the new GWAC.</p>

VENDOR CONFERENCE:  DOC will host a vendor conference on Thursday August 14, 2008 from 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. for the purpose of answering questions regarding this RFI.  The conference will be held in Room 1414 of the DOC Headquarters located at the intersection of 14th Street NW and Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.  To attend, please contact Brian Wolfe, 202-482-1876 not later than noon on Thursday August 14th.  The Federal Triangle Metro Station is only one block away if you walk through the Reagan Building.

ATTACHMENTS:  Please note there are two attachments with this notice.  One, RFI.doc, is a Microsoft Word 2003 copy of this notice that includes a drawing of the CSTARS ORSI architecture.  The other, DOC Pricing RFI.xls, is a Microsoft Excel 2003 spreadsheet for entering pricing information.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  The U.S. Department of Commerce is seeking sources, product capability information and pricing information to support a business case and budget for a new enterprise-wide web-based procurement system that is integrated with the Commerce Core Financial System (CFS).  The focus is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends.  

In its current state, the Commerce Acquisition System Environment consists of the following:

	Commerce Standard Acquisition Reporting System (CSTARS) i.e., CACI Federal, Inc. Comprizon.Buy (C.Buy) contract writing and contract information system
	CACI Federal Inc., Comprizon.Request (C.Request) requisitioning system for placing procurement requests
	Obligation and Requisition Standard Interface (ORSI), the interface to the DOC Core Financial System (CFS)
	Enterprise Acquisition Reporting System (EARS), the DOC procurement data warehouse

DOC has approximately 500 users employing the C.Buy procurement software, 4000 users employing the C.Request requisitioning software and 50 users employing the EARS procurement data warehouse.

Commerce currently employs the Comprizon.Buy product from CACI Federal, Inc. as the contract writing, contract management and contract information system portion of CSTARS.  This product is based on client-server technology and has ended its COTS product life.  The contract information system portion of this product does not provide robust data collection and reporting which necessitates the EARS application described in paragraphs below.  

Currently there are four production instances of Comprizon.Buy deployed at Commerce.  The fours instances of the application, one each for the Office of the Secretary (OS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Census Bureau.  The Office of Computer Services (OCS) in Springfield, VA hosts acquisition data for Census, OS, and NOAA.  OCS provides each bureau with their own environment that includes a separate instance of the CSTARS application and Oracle database.  Although also using CSTARS, NIST operates and maintains a separate instance at their Gaithersburg, MD offices.  Collectively, this means that CTARS is currently located physically at two locations, Springfield and Gaithersburg.

The objective is to migrate to one production instance servicing all four bureaus.  However, the single instance must interface with three instances of the Core Financial System (CFS) located at Census, in Suitland, MD; NOAA, in Germantown, MD; and NIST, in Gaithersburg, MD.  The NIST instance also services OS.  The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) employs the Momentum finance and procurement system and is not in scope of this new enterprise-wide effort.

Commerce also employs the CACI Comprizon.Request requisitioning system which is still supported by the vendor as a COTS product.  If this system can be retained in the new system, there may be advantages to the Department and this information would be useful to include in a response to this RFI.

While each bureau's data is currently stored in disparate databases, DoC is utilizing a data warehouse solution  Enterprise Acquisition Reporting System (EARS) -- that provides for enterprise-wide reporting capabilities.  EARS employs the SAS Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) Suite to create canned and ad hoc procurement reports.  The data for these reports are loaded from an Oracle data warehouse using SAS Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) software.  This provides a more robust query tool than is available from the current Comprizon.Buy system.

While CSTARS is currently implemented in a client/server environment, it utilizes Citrix Metaframe as an application server.  Citrix provides increases system efficiency by shifting most of the processing from the local client to the application server.  All application logic executes on the server and only screen updates (i.e. screen images), mouse movements and keystrokes are transmitted via Citrix.  This reduces the amount of data transferred between the client and server, thus, alleviating potential network bandwidth issues. 

Like all other government agencies, DoC is required to integrate certain components of their acquisition systems with components of the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  Information regarding the IAE is available at http://egov.gsa.gov.  At a minimum, the new DOC acquisition system must be interfaced to FedBizOpps, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG).  The current CACI Comprizon.Buy system currently provides this functionality which must be retained.

Financial Interface

In 2006, the DoC Acquisition community implemented an interface to the DoC financial system, called the Core Financial System (CFS).  This interface is called the Obligation & Requisition Standard Interface (ORSI).  ORSI is designed, developed, deployed as a standard interface between CSTARS and the Departments Core Financial System (CFS).  

ORSI includes an interface for requisitions, obligations, and non-Central Contractor Registration (CCR) vendors. This interface has a major impact on existing procurement and finance business processes at the Bureaus.  

Implementation of ORSI included new processing methods, the elimination of some manual entry, and increased system conformity.  The CSTARS ORSI deployment consisted of separate deployment activities at each of the four Bureaus (Census, NIST, NOAA, and OS) and OCS.  Each of these locations link via existing connections using TIBCO (the Department-wide EAI tool) and Java Messaging Service (JMS) queues.

Pricing Information Request:

INSTRUCTIONS:  Please provide pricing information (in thousands of dollars) for each activity by fiscal year.  Pricing data should be provided over the 10 year lifecycle and the out-years should reflect inflation factors as determined by your pricing model.  

Budget planning is for the system replacement to begin in FY 2010 and be complete by mid FY 2011.  While costs in FY 2010 and FY 2011 may include both non-recurring and recurring costs, it is anticipated that FY 2012 and beyond will be only steady state recurring operation and maintenance costs.  If you reflect non-recurring costs (ilel, planning or acquisition costs) beyond FY 2011, please discuss the rationale in your accompanying narrative.

For budget planning we distinguish between non-recurring costs to deploy the system (Planning Activities and Acquisition Activities) and recurring year-to year costs which represent Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Activities.  You will see some elements such as training in both acquisition and in operations and maintenance.  In this case, training in the acquisition phase is to train the entire workforce on new software, while in the operations and maintenance phase, the concentration is training of new hires.  It is important to keep the concept of segregating recurring from non-recurring costs.

Some O&M activities are not performed annually, such as certification and accreditation (a tri-annual federal requirement) or hardware refresh on a three to five year cycle (depending on your own estimate).  While these are not annual activities, they are considered recurring costs to be reflected in the O&M section because they are not associated directly with deploying the system as opposed to maintaining the system.

Specific pricing information for activities such as Modify Financial Interface or Data Migration will be considered a rough order of magnitude and should be based on experience with other similar Federal agencies and similar understanding.  It would be most helpful to include pricing ranges for those efforts mentioned above along with quality remarks that you would deem to be beneficial in understanding your estimates.  Please also include information regarding which costs would be subcontracted.  These should be provided in a narrative separate from the spreadsheet in a separate MS Word or Adobe Acrobat document.

NOTE:  We recognize that though quality pricing information is being provided on an ESTIMATE ONLY basis, it will not be used for legally binding purposes.  

Following are the descriptions for the price elements to be completed in the spreadsheet.  Where reference are made to additional requested comments, please do not put these in the spreadsheet, but include them in a separate narrative in a Microsoft Word 2003 (or earlier version) or Adobe Acrobat document.

Planning Activities:

The first of three phases of the system lifecycle, planning, means preparing, developing or acquiring the information you will use to design and implement the system. Planning must progress to the point where you are ready to commit to achieving specific goals before preceding to the acquisition phase. Planning activities may include process flow diagrams, data dictionaries, engineering and design studies, and prototypes. 

Process Changes and Data Standardization - This is the cost associated with assistance in identifying necessary process changes and data standardization efforts going from four bureau systems to a single, enterprise-wide acquisition system.

Data Migration Planning - This is the cost associated with the planning of data migration from the existing four C.Request & C.Buy systems to a single, enterprise-wide acquisition system.  C.Buy has data dating back to 1999.  C.Request has data dating back to 2006.  Given the limit information that is being provided, it is anticipated that you are able to use your experience with other similar Federal agencies to provide a range that will be substantiated by comments (e.g. name of agency, total number of records migrated, tasks accomplished, environment, etc.) included with your estimate. 

Misc. Planning Support Requirements - This is the cost associated with known ancillary requirements not associated with any other planning activity categories.  Please specify those requirements with their associated costs.

Acquisition Activities:
This is the second of three phases of the system lifecycle.  This phase begins when funding from Congress has been realized and lasts until the system is delivered and fully operational.  

Install and Test New Acquisition Software - This is the cost associated with installing and testing the new acquisition system software that will replace the C.Buy & C.Request.  Significant testing is expected for both the financial interface between the new system and the DoC Core Financial System and the various interfaces of the Federal Integrated Acquisition Environment with emphasis on FPDS-NG, CCR and FedBizOpps.

Modify Financial Interface (ORSI) - This is the cost associated with modifying the new acquisition software to interface with the DoC Core Financial System.  The current interface, Obligation and Requisition Standard Interface-ORSI, uses an Enterprise Application Interface (EAI) software solution or middle-ware (i.e. TIBCO) to pass data between systems in near real-time.  Transactions that are passed include all data associated with:  commitments, obligations, modifications, vendor and contract close-out. Given the limited information that is being provided, it is anticipated that you are able to use your experience with other similar Federal agencies to provide a range that will be substantiated by comments (e.g. name of agency, total number of records interfaced, tasks accomplished, environment, etc.) included with your estimate.

Develop & Deliver Portal-like Functionality -This is the cost associated with providing the desired web interface for the new web-based system and all acquisition system interfaces.  It includes the cost to provide a single sign-on to the system and an integrated "dashboard" capability for procurement customers.  The intent is to provide portal-like functionality using content management software. 

Data Migration - This is the cost associated with migrating existing C.Request and C.Buy data into the new acquisition system. Given the limit information that is being provided, it is anticipated that you are able to use your experience with other similar Federal agencies to provide a range that will be substantiated by comments (e.g. name of agency, total number of records migrated, tasks accomplished, environment, etc.) included with your estimate.

Initial Requisition Training (4,000 Requisitioners) - This is the cost associated with training the current workforce of approximately 4,000 requisitioner to use the new acquisition system.  It is assumed that training materials are included with your estimate unless noted.  If training materials are not included, please provide costing information.  Please include the number of training hours with your estimate.  It is our intent to convert all estimates to a unit cost per person.  Please provide the information necessary to complete this conversion.

Initial Contract Specialist Training (500 Buyers) - This is the cost associated with training the current workforce of approximately 500 buyer to use the new acquisition system.  It is assumed that training materials are included with your estimate unless noted.  If training materials are not included, please provide costing information.  Please include the number of training hours with your estimate.  It is our intent to convert all estimates to a unit cost per person.  Please provide the information necessary to complete this conversion.

Initial System Administrator Training (12 Administrators) - This is the cost associated with training the current workforce of approximately 12 system FTEs administrator to use the new acquisition system.  It is assumed that training materials are included with your estimate unless noted.  If training materials are not included, please provide costing information.  Please include the number of training hours with your estimate.  It is our intent to convert all estimates to a unit cost per person.  Please provide the information necessary to complete this conversion.

Initial Developer/Tester Training (12 Testers) - This is the cost associated with training the current workforce of approximately 12 DOC testers/quality assurance to use the new acquisition system.  These developer/testers will provide functional and full-regression testing of new software.   It is assumed that training materials are included with your estimate unless noted.  If training materials are not included, please provide costing information.  Please include the number of training hours with your estimate.  It is our intent to convert all estimates to a unit cost per person.  Please provide the information necessary to complete this conversion.

Hardware - This is the cost associated with new hardware such as servers and networking equipment needed to utilize the new acquisition software.

Database Software (e.g. Oracle, DB2, MySQL, etc.) - This is the cost associated with the underlying software that would support the new acquisition system (e.g. Oracle).

New COTS Requisition Software - This is the cost associated with either the license or base fee for a subscription-based pricing structure for a requisitioning system.  DoC currently uses CACI Federal, Inc. Comprizon.Request.

New COTS Procurement Software - This is the cost associated with either the license or base fee for a subscription-based pricing structure for a contract writing and contract management system.  DoC currently uses CACI Federal, Inc. C.Buy.  This cost also includes the cost of updating agency clause logic.

Misc. Acquisition Support Requirements - This is the cost associated with known ancillary requirements not associated with any other acquisition activity categories.  Please specify.


Operation & Maintenance Activities:
This is the third of three phases in the system lifecycle.  Once the system is deployed, these ongoing, routine, O&M costs are the steady state activities that are generally consistent throughout the remainder of the lifecycle. These costs are anticipated to be stable with some spikes (e.g. hardware refresh, C&A activities) and most of the growth is from inflation.   O&M includes operating and maintaining the system at the deployed and accepted capability and performance level.

Testing Support of new Releases - This is the cost associated with testing support in response to changes to the acquisition system and it's configuration
Configuration and Change Control Support - This is the cost associated with collecting system change requests, determining and costing the necessary system changes, vetting the resolution, and documenting the change over the system life.  This includes maintaining a requirement repository, maintaining documentation of drivers for initial requirements, walk-through Change Control process, facilitating the Change Control process and Change Control Program Management.

Triennial Security C&A - This is the cost associated with accomplishing the required security certification and assessment activities to be accomplished every three years.

Recurring Requisitioner Training - This is the cost associated with training new-hires and retraining to account for system changes and turn-over.  The figure should assume 800 trainees per year (e.g.  new DoC employees) with updates to training classes and documentation.  It is assumed that training materials are included with your estimate unless noted.  If training materials are not included, please provide costing information.  Please include the number of training hours with your estimate.  It is our intent to convert all estimates to a unit cost per person.  Please provide the information necessary to complete this conversion.

Recurring Contract Specialist Training - This is the cost associated with training new-hires and retraining to account for system changes and turn-over.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SUPERSEDES THE PREVIOUS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.
The United States Geological Survey, Office of the Pacific Southwest Regional Executive, Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project intends to make a non-competitive award to Denton Design Associates of Pasadena, California.  The period of performance is requested from date of award through October 15, 2008.  The requirement of services is for a business supplement to the document Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country and update of six (6) pages of the 2004 version of Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country.  Denton Design Associates has been the graphics designer for all versions of Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country since its inception in 1994.  This document explains the most up-to-date science about the earthquake risk in that region and thus fills the USGS goal to communicate its scientific results to support earthquake loss reduction.  
The contractor's unique capabilities include their experience in communicating earthquake information to the general public.  Any other contractor would cost the government additional time just in learning the layout and features of this publication.  In addition, these documents are subject to copyright owned by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) and authorized by SCEC to Denton Design Associates.  These documents are not the sole property of the US Geological Survey.         
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(13)(i), other responsible sources that believe they can meet the requirement described above may submit a capability statement or quotation no later than the closing date of this announcement which will be considered by the USGS.  All responses must be in writing, by e-mail to the Contracting Officer at sklingler@usgs.gov.
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective 12 June 2008.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to award a contract for the Long Branch Beach renourishment project. This project will include the dredging of sand from the designated Sea Bright Borrow Area, located off Sandy Hook, NJ. The Sea Bright Borrow Area is located approximately five miles off shore at a mean water depth of 75 feet. The material (beach fill) will be placed north of Lake Takanassee. There will be 500,000 CY to 1,000,000 CY taken from the Sea Bright Borrow Area for Long Branch Beach renourishment project.<br /><br />The Contractor will be required to prepare and submit a site-specific unexplored ordnance (UXO) operational work plan to the government for approval prior to dredging operations. The Contractors proposed methodology of performing a magnetometer search and ordnance removal will be required as part of the work plan.<br /><br />The Contractor will also be required to conduct Sea Turtle and Whale monitoring during the period of June 15th through November 15th. The Contractor cannot place beach fill material during the period of March 15th through September 15th due to Piper Plovers nesting on the beach. There are additional restrictions to beach fill placement during the period of May 1st to November 1st. These restrictions are to avoid disturbance to bird nesting from Sea Beach Amaranth and Terns.<br /><br />This procurement is being solicited as UNRESTRICTED, full and open competition to all business concerns. The applicable NAICS CODE is 237990. The small business size is $18,500,000. The SIC Code is 1629, Heavy Construction, not elsewhere classified. The estimated construction cost is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business goals are as follows: Small Business 70.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 6.5%, HUBzone Small Business 9.8%, Women-Owned Small Business 7.5%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 4.0%, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 2.0%. A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal can not be met. You may contact the District, the deputy Small Business advocate, or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance. The selected contractor will be required to commence work within 5 calendar days after the date the Contractor receives the Notice to Proceed, prosecute the work diligently, and complete the work no later than 730 calendar days for the entire project, after the date the Contractor receives the Notice to Proceed. The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The Government has now implemented a web-enabled application that collects and manages contractor past performance data. Effective 1 April 2007, the system, CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS), requires both the contractor and the Government to submit their portion of the CPARS report via the internet for Construction contracts in excess of $100,000.00. More definitive guidance and instructions will be incorporated in the solicitation and resultant contract. In the meantime, to become familiar with the system, the CPARS website has a computer-based training module and a practice session for your use at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/ct/I/home.asp by following the links to the Training. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 11 July 2008 with bid opening on/about&nbsp;26 August 2008.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer technical questions and extend the bid opening date. The bid opening date is extended to 9/5/08 at 1:30 pm.<BR><BR>1. What CFM @ PSI ? <BR>A)Per M-1 Dwg., the air compressor capacity range (since it has a variable speed drive) is 41-88 cfm at 65-160 psi.<BR>2. What is the max receiver PSI you are looking for ? <BR>A)Maximum receiver psi should be 160 psi.<BR><BR>3. Since this is a replacement for the existing, how long can the system be down? <BR>A)The current compressed air system cannot tolerate any downtime because it supplies air to the existing HVAC system. A temporary air compressor need to be used while the work is being done.<BR><BR>4. The voltage spelled out in the specs is 230/3/60, yet the panels are marked 208/3/60. For VFD drive this can be a big difference for the drive. Can someone verify voltage? <BR>A)The manufacturer's spec sheet shows 230v/3-ph/60H for the compressor power needs. A new electrical Panel will then need to be providedif the existing electrical panel is rated at 208/3/60.<BR><BR>5. The room was rather warm, has anyone given any consideration to the ventalation in the room? We estimated the room temperature at 82 degrees F. <BR>A)Proper ventilation for the room is not being addressed in this project. It may have to be analyzed and dealt with in another new project since there are also other heat producing HVAC equipment in the room.<BR><BR>6. Since the specified compressor is a total air system (TAS) are we replacing the dryer located on the wall and marked as the PRV station? Can the system be made of individual components? This makes maintenance and future replacement work easier. <BR>A)The new compressor system is a TAS (total air system) and the equipment description shown on the M-1 dwg shows it to have its own refrigerated dryer, 120 gal. air receiver and etc. The existing filters & air receiver tank near the existing PRV station can be bypassed.<BR><BR>7. The TAS also has filtration, will that replace the filters near the PRV station?<BR>A)See 6.<BR><BR>8. Will we need a temporary compressor to supply building air? <BR>A)See 3.<BR><BR>9. The dew point monitor is not well versed. Is this a digital readout, or just color change beads similar to those found on desiccant dryers? There is a big difference in cost.<BR>A)Dew point monitor should be the digital readout type.<BR><BR>10. The large 2 copper line was closed off. All of the air was directed thru a smaller 3/4 line. That line fed the filters and dryer. Due to the ambient conditions of the room, the dryer may need to be sized larger than the stated flow. Has any consideration been given to this? Has anyone complained of wet air or moisture in the building? <BR>A)Use the 3/4 inch air line (instead of the closed-off 2inch line)since it is used by the current old air compressor.<BR><BR><BR>11. Please verify the voltage required for the air compressor is 460v. The current unit is 208v and if 460v is required for the new unit, a step-up transformer will be required. <BR>A)See 4.<BR><BR>12. Are you requesting the contractor to re-pipe the new unit or use the existing piping? <BR>A) See 10.<BR><BR>13. It is somewhat unclear if you want a new receiver and dryer or if you want us to use the existing equipment? <BR>A) See 6.<BR><BR>14. Is the proposal due date 8/15/08? <BR>A) Bids are due 9/5 at 1:30 pm.<BR><BR>15. What amount or percentage should the bid bond be for and do we have to mail this in separately?<BR>A) Bid Bond is 20% of Bid amount and must be sent in with Bid.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
