<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Services North Atlantic Area intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with RMF Engineering, Inc., Baltimore MD for construction management services required for the replacement of a greenhouse at its research location, Foreign Disease-Weed Science Research, Fort Dietrick, MD.  RMF Engineering Inc. prepared the design specification and drawings under the USDA’s expired IDIQ contract 53-3615-0-0100.  The Government has determined that awarding these services to a firm other than the designer of record would result in substantial duplication of cost and increase the performance period significantly to this mission critical project. Statutory authority under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source that will satisfy the agency needs.  Otherwise qualified firms that can provide the construction management services without a negative impact to the project must respond to this notice prior to close of business on February 6, 2006. Offerors responding to this notice must demonstrate their ability to provide an equivalent service, rationale as to why they should be considered and demonstrate that bringing in another A&E firm will not impact the program’s cost or schedule.

All qualified responsible business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Id!  entification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA’s homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest is extending the current 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from 25 April 2006 to 24 April 2007 and is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to three additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  Only NAICS code sectors 236, 237 and 238 are eligible to participate on this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS and a secondary NAICS (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open /advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) developmental stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protege firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 09 March 2006; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS sectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.

The NUWC Newport intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Thales Computers, Raleigh, NC for the following items: 4 ea industrial range 32 channel modules, 1 ea 64 channel optocoupled module
 (CM-DI-40/9/I/SOX, 2 ea 24 D/A channel modules, 6 ea digital output boards, and 5 ea 64 channel optocoupled modules (CM-DI-40/4/I/SOX).  These items are used as an assembly kit for existing shipboard systems. The basis for the sole source is that the configuration specifications and software code are not universal designs that can accommodate alternate component designs. Substitution of any other component would be incompatible with the existing configuration and would lead to significant reenginerring and qualification costs and delays. The efforts, costs, and delays include, but not limited to, engineering evaluation, revising applicable GDEB configuration specifications, altering software code, revising software specifications, testing (EQT and FQT) and generating qualification documentation. 

The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.

The Technical Assistance is designed to enable the MTC to further its policy objectives to modernize the telecommunications sector by measuring results, based on specific targets to be achieved by 2009.  Targets will be established for teledensity (including wireless), number of communities with service, rural penetration, public telephone access, information society measures, Internet access, customer service, and transition to new technologies such as IP networks, fiber optics, and wireless systems.

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to promote further market liberalization, consumer protection, the utilization of advanced information and communication technologies (ICT), a healthy environment for private investment, and the development of services that will lead to an adequate insertion of Peru in the global knowledge and information society.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following tasks:
1) Develop work plan and conduct assessment of market and regulatory conditions; 2) Prepare draft strategic plan; 3) Develop and consolidate policy recommendations and prepare the final strategic plan; 4) Development impact assessment; and 5) Final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $425,720 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFP's received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT PARK ATTENDANT l, ROCK CREEK PARK C.1 General Information C.1.1 Background:  Perry Lake is typical of northern Kansas, which consists of rolling uplands, eroded valleys of varying widths and meandering streams.  The valley along the Delaware River is formed by irregular hills with slopes ranging from fairly gentl e to steep. The steep slopes are usually covered in native woodlands. Gentle slopes prevail in the upper valley of the main river and along tributary arms and are generally tillable.  A very noticeable quality of Perry Lake is its diverse habitats and environment. Traveling through one park may evoke impressions of the Missouri Ozarks while moments later; another area will possess characteristics of a prairie environment found in centra l Kansas. The rolling geography and wooded roadside provide scenic drives through some of the park areas. Most of the shorelines are enshrouded with woodlands and shrubs that partially obscure scenic views of the lake. The Kansas River basin has a drainage area of approximately 1117 square miles of total area above the dam. There are 39,338.47 acres of fee land and 3,449.24 acres of flowage easement, with 1,187.58 in Atchison County and 2,261.66 acres in Jefferson County  for a total acquisition of 42,787.71 acres.  The lake has 11,631 acres of surface area and 159 miles of shoreline at multipurpose pool.  The Corps of Engineers has primary responsibility for the lake operations, wildlife management, Federal Parks, lands outside public areas, shoreline management and numerous other aspects of management of Perry Lake. The Corps of Engineers also provides som e assistance, whenever feasible, with the hunting, fisheries management and enforcement of safe boating regulations. Perry Dam is located 3 miles north of Perry, Kansas in Jefferson County and at mile 5.3 of the Delaware River in the northeast portion of the state. It is situated within 50 miles of one-third of the states population. Three of the states four metropolit an areas are in close proximity to the lake: Topeka, Kansas City, and Lawrence. Due to the lakes proximity to these population areas, the lake will continue to receive high use. C.1.2 Scope of Work: The Contractor shall provide labor, material, and equipment as specified to perform park attendant duties at the Rock Creek Park as described in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) and elsewhere in the contract.

<CONTACT>Jim Kelly, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 882-6634, Fax (703) 882-6356, Email Jim.Kelly@mda.mil
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE CLOSING DATE BY SIX (6) MONTHS TO 31 JULY 2006 FROM 31 JANUARY 2006, AND TO UPDATE THE CURRENT POINT OF CONTACT INFORMATION.  THE BAA ANNOUNCEMENT IS REISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-04-MDA-BAA MODIFICATION 05.
The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capabilities or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.     

To investigate these new technologies, the Deputy for Advanced Systems (MDA/AS) established the Advanced Systems Innovation Cell (ASIC) to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  The ASIC team consists of subject matter experts tasked with evaluating new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The ASIC seeks new and inventive concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.     

Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following ten technology areas: (1)Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Transmit/receive modules, Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; and Passive RF Systems; (2)Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Passive EO/IR Systems including ideas and concepts for IR materials and FPAs that enable high performance passive EO/IR systems that are large format, have multicolor capability, are manufacturable, producible, low cost and have capability to extend to VLWIR operating at temperatures higher than 35? Kelvin, Read-out electronics, Lethality Mechanisms; Laser Imaging with High Frame Rates, Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) testing of Multi-/Hyper-Spectral Sensors, HWIL testing of LADAR systems in a Thermal Vacuum Environment, test of ground, air, space, sea-based operations (all wavelengths will be considered); (3)Mathematics and Computer Science including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Decision Systems, Estimation, Prediction, Homing Navigation, Data Fusion, Pattern Recognition, Identification, Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion and Distributed Systems for Scene Generation; (4)Signal and Data Processing including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5)Physics and Chemistry including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6)Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering including Space Systems, Micro satellites (bus and payload designs, precision guidance, navigation & control; subsystems, and components-such as precision propulsion and constellation networking), Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, Materials Science to include Lightweight, Thermo-Resistant Materials for Boosters; Higher-Pressure Launcher Components for high speed Projectiles, and Erosion-Resistant Launch Tubes for Light Gas Guns, Quantification, prediction, and compensation of aero-optic effects of turbulence on imaging sensors; (7)Battle Management/Command and Control including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification; Aircraft mountable high bandwidth communications (T1 minimum with T3 or greater preferred) for line of sight and over the horizon data transfer; and Lethality Assessment Technologies, non-real-time, non-tactical (not kill assessment) test applications; and Discrimination and Fire Control; (8)High Altitude Airships technologies including platforms designs, subsystems, components and payloads, electrolyzers, fuel cells, Solar arrays; (9)Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) to include Divert and Attitude Control Systems technologies at the component/subsystem/system levels for kill vehicle applications.
(10)Modeling and Simulations technologies including Network Emulators for TADL J, S-TADIL J and TADIL K which represent real-time tactical data networks in terms of communication protocols, variable traffic and distance-dependent transport delays, and bit error rates in the presence of variable EMI/ECM; Real-Time IR Digital Scene Generation and Sensor Emulation to generate complex, composite scenes and respond to dynamics associated with interceptor, target complex and background movement, incorporate spatial variability and time-varying noise produced by detector response to generated scenes to exercise the non-uniformity compensation, detection and feature-tracking functions of the sensor software, a real-time standalone system that accepts object states as imputs and outputs real-time detector-corrupted and pixilated video images of complex scenes in LVDS or camera link format; M&S Generation to superimpose synthetic Electro-optic scenes, insitu at the EO sensor detector, while observing real-world scenes (e.g. simulation-over-live during a flight test); and Simulation Framework as an open architecture, open source, M&S simulation framework to perform distributed real-time simulations using reconfigurable objects (all digital, hardware-in-loop or live).     

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (no more than five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .PDF file) to the point of contact listed below.  White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information.

In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government?s rights in technical data which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper.     MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighted equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offerors? capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35. 016).  White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until JULY 31, 2006.  

Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete.  The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.     These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2004 through FY 2006.  

Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award.

<DESC>****Modification 2 is being issued to cancel NLM-06-053 in its entirety.****


It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole-source basis with Technical Resources International Inc. (TRI) under the authority of FAR 6.302 for
computerized information support services to maintain and enhance the Chemical  carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS).  The mission of the NLM Division of Specialized Information Services is to: (1) provide selected core toxicology and environmental health information resources and services; (2) facilitate access to national and international toxicology and environmental health information resources; and (3) strengthen the information infrastructure of toxicology and environmental health.  The CCRIS database is an integral component of NLM’s mission to provide biomedical information.  As a primary user and disseminator of the CCRIS data, NLM wishes to transition the responsibility for CCRIS from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to NLM.  NLM will be unable to fulfill this component of its mission without continuation of the current highly efficient and effective computerized information services support.
		
CCRIS (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System) is an online database originally created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  In 1985, CCRIS was mounted on the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) system, and the database was maintained using TOXNET data input software.  The database contains data and results of research studies for over 9000 chemical compounds. The chemical - specific data fall into the selected areas of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and tumor inhibition.  Full bibliographic references are also included in addition to specific indexing. 

The Contractor shall maintain and enhance the CCRIS database which resides, and may be searched, on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System. The input for this data base
comes from several sources such as:

- Surveillance and review of the published literature (e.g., CASelects)
- IARC Monographs
- NCI/NTP Toxicity and Bioassay Reports
- Applicable database searches

The Contractor shall survey these sources and evaluate pertinent data in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  At the direction of the Project Officer, the Contractor shall enter
suitable studies on chemicals into the CCRIS database.

The software for the maintenance and update of the CCRIS database on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System will be provided by the National Library of Medicine.

General process for CCRIS record building:

A Senior Scientist (Ph.D.) reviews published literature and results of database searches (typically abstracts) and selects potential studies.

An Information Specialist (B.S.) acquires copies of full reports/studies online (e.g., Docline) and at local libraries.  The citations, with a unique reference code, are also added to the reference file and retained for future use.
A Senior Scientist reviews the full reports/studies and determines if the report/study meets the established evaluation criteria.  If determined to be relevant and acceptable, the Senior Scientist codes the relevant data from the study onto standardized code sheets.

The code sheets and the full report/study are reviewed for scientific accuracy and completeness by an expert Peer Reviewer (Ph.D.).  Questions and issues are resolved with the Senior Scientist.

An Information Specialist enters the data from the code sheets into CCRIS using TOXNET’s SSEUS data entry system.

A Staff Scientist (M.S.) double-checks (quality control/quality assurance) the data entered against the original code sheets.  Any questions or discrepancies are resolved with the Senior Scientist.  

The log of the period’s activity is sent to and reviewed by the Project Manager.  When approved, the Project Manager notifies NLM staff that the entered data is ready for public release.

Monthly reports are generated that reflect monthly activities and related costs.
				
TRI has provided expert information services support, through an NCI contract, to maintain and enhance the CCRIS database since its inception on the TOXNET system in 1985.  TRI has established a strong working relationship with NLM and uniquely understands the utilization of CCRIS data by the scientific community.  TRI’s previous 21 years of experience with NCI and NLM have proven critical to the success of the CCRIS database.  This experience with NLM and NLM’s SSEUS data entry system uniquely qualifies TRI as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services.  Therefore there will be no time lost with the usual learning curve or start-up processes.  It is determined that TRI is the only available source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience to successfully complete the above requirements.  Due to time constraints and a compelling need to avoid gaps in the maintenance and enhancement of CCRIS, TRI’s continued service is considered a crucial component to the transition of the CCRIS database from NCI to NLM. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) business days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.

<DESC>Change for this requirement is as follows:  Tasks include all supervision, equipment, materials, labor, travel and all means necessary to provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with a response to perform decommissioning, demolition and debris remov al operations.  This applies to private, public or commercial structures damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita. The Government intends to award nine (9) firm-fixed-price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts in three (3) groups for a  total pool not-to exceed $240,000,000.  Each will be for a one year Base and a one year option period.  These requirements are pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5150, Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act which states, preference shall be gi ven to the extent feasible and practicable, to those organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by such major disaster or emergency.  A preference for Phase II & III has been requested to restrict compet ition to those individuals and/or firms residing or doing business primarily in the State of Louisiana for areas in southeast and southwest Louisiana.  Phase I, Competitive 8(a) is restricted by the SBA Louisiana District Office to 8(a) firms located withi n its geographical boundaries under NAICS code 238910 defined as having average annual receipts of less than $13 million for the past 3 years.  This requirement is processed under Service Contract Act (SCA), therefore, this construction NAICS code applies as a matter of conformance for applicable wage rates.  Restriction to Louisiana firms for phase II and III is contingent upon the final approval of the Department of the Army.  In the event approval is not received, the Contracting Officer anticipates awar d by full and open competition.  Contract awards will be phased in as tasks are received from FEMA.  Contract issuance will be as follows: Phase I, Contracts 1, 2, & 3 for a total pool of $45,000,000 as competitive 8(a), Phase II, Contracts 4, 5, & 6 for a  total pool of $80,000,000 for HUBZone set-aside concerns and Phase III, Contracts 7, 8, & 9 will be for a total pool of $115,000,000 as unrestricted for all other business concerns, if sufficient requirements exist.  Work shall include, but not limited to : demolition of single/multi-family homes, garages, barns, storage sheds, fences, school buildings, police or fire stations, public office buildings, commercial buildings, and perform the decommissioning, demolition, and removal of debris, transporting to a designated disposal site and cleaning of the site of surrounding debris.  This includes final disposition of such items as boats and cars.  The contractor shall grade surface to acceptable levels after demolition.  It is also anticipated that asbestos ab atement work may be required on certain structures prior to demolition as part of the decommissioning process.  Sorting of asbestos debris and placement on right of way for proper disposal will be required.  Woody debris will be kept segregated from constr uction/demolition (C&D) debris as much as possible. Woody debris includes vegetative debris and clean woody C&D debris, (i.e., not pressure-treated wood or wood with significant painted surfaces). The contractor shall repair all roadways, sidewalks, utilit ies, drainage structures and other features not designated for demolition or removal, if damaged by Contractor operations and re-slope to original grade.  Plans and Specifications will be available on the FedTeDS web site at www.fedteds.gov.  In order to d ownload the files, you must be registered in FedTeDS.  Once the solicitation is released to the public, the unique link to the solicitation package will be in FedBizOps at www.fbo.gov.  Issue date will be available on or about 15 February 2006.  Proposal d ue date is 15 March 2006.  Offerors that are Large Business are required to submit a subcontracting Plan.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this information, but may release an RFP at a later date based on the need for this type of technology and its feasibility based upon the responses to this request for information (RFI). This request is for information planning purposes and to allow industry an opportunity to provide information and comments on a proposed radio architecture and related technologies for space based radios.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact, no later than March 15, 2006.  In responding, use reference RFI-NNC06000001L. Description The National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) is developing an open architecture description for software defined radios (SDR).  The Space Transceiver Radio System (STRS) SDR architecture provides architecture level specifications for hardware and software development to abstract the software waveforms from hardware platforms.  The architecture strives to support existing (e.g. legacy) communications needs and capabilities while providing a path to more capable, advanced network connectivity that promotes scalable, modular, reconfigurable, and upgradeable functionality and features.  The NASA Software Defined Radio Architecture Team (SAT), comprised of HQ and multi-Center personnel, is responsible for the development of the architecture definition.  The recommendations from the SAT will be given to NASA’s Space Communication Architecture Working Group (SCAWG) for consideration as a radio standard for NASA’s future communication architecture.  The purpose of this request for information is to solicit comments that will be relevant to planning NASA’s future Space Communications Radio Architecture.  The information being sought includes comments on the preliminary draft of the architecture definition and the industry’s estimate for the impact, in cost, schedule and risk, of complying with the specification during the design, development, and verification of the space radio.  Comments are being sought from those developing and/or integrating radios for NASA, DoD, and commercial space applications. The SAT is requesting a written report and a summary presentation from the responder.  The summary presentation is expected to occur in the Reston, Virginia area, tentatively planned for February 14th and if needed, the morning of February 15th, 2006.  Approximately 1- 1.5 hours (depending on number of companies presenting) will be available to each company to individually brief the SAT.  The audience for the presentation will include members of the SAT and possibly the Space Communication Architecture Working Group (SCAWG).  The company’s history in responding to other applicable NASA solicitations, such as the Request for Information for the SCAWG, could be summarized in the presentation, but the details of the material do not have to be repeated.  Presentations should be scheduled with: Michael Collins ASRC Aerospace Reston, Virginia Phone: 571-262-3136 michael.collins@asrcaerospace.com Written Response: The written response is due to the technical contacts listed below by March 15, 2006 and should contain the following items: 1.Contact information of the submitter      a. Name of Organization      b. Name, email address, and phone number of individual  	responsible for the submission 2. Use of the submitted material by NASA. We desire to make all portions of the responses available to the Government community (e.g. NASA, JTRS, DoD, JPL) and contractors who have signed an NDA with the SCAWG.  Therefore, unless otherwise stated or noted, all responses to this RFI shall be made publicly available. Those wishing to keep their responses confidential should state so with such wording as “’company name’ Proprietary” or “Limited distribution. Please do not disclose outside of the US Government.” 3.STRS Open Architecture Description Comments: Please provide comments specific to the Architecture Description document, considering the following items.       a. Describe how the STRS Architecture Description Document  	 may be improved to meet the needs of the radio,    	 waveform,and component suppliers.

Project Description:  The goal of this project is to design and conduct, in collaboration with and under the direction of Federal staff, an independent, objective cross-site evaluation of the Mental Health Transformation State Incentive Grant Program (MHT SIG) that satisfies evaluation requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and SAMHSA’s National Outcome Measures (NOMS).  The MHT SIG program supports an array of infrastructure and service delivery improvement activities to help States build a solid foundation for delivering and sustaining effective mental health and related services.  Five (5)-year grants have been awarded to the Offices of the Governors of seven (7) States.  States are expected to develop and implement a Comprehensive State Mental Health Plan that builds on a thorough needs assessment and inventory of resources and cuts across State agencies that provide services relevant to mental health.  The evaluation must be designed in cooperation with the grantees and Federal staff.  Ultimately, the evaluation must determine the extent to which mental health systems have been transformed and the extent to which transformation results in changes in client outcomes and recovery, both in the long-term and as transformation progresses.  In addition, the evaluation must provide useful information regarding aspects of transformation that are and are not working to grantees as the program progresses, in order to assist them in making their transformation efforts as useful as possible.  The evaluation will document the factors that contribute to successful transformation in order to inform the transformation efforts of other States and the Federal government.

The focus of this procurement will be to: (1) Collaborate with Grantees - Convene and manage communications among the grantees and Federal staff regarding development of the evaluation design.  Communications will include teleconferences, listservs, and grantee meetings, as well as separate communications with individual grantees, as needed, to ensure that the evaluation is feasible and meaningful for all stakeholders.  Provide materials to the group to guide discussions and maximize the efficient use of everybody’s time in contributing ideas regarding the evaluation; (2) Convene Experts, including Consumers - Help to identify, hire, and convene expert consultants, as needed, to assist in designing and conducting the evaluation.  Help to identify, hire, and convene mental health consumers with expertise in evaluation to assist  fully in all aspects of designing and conducting the evaluation; (3) Create a Logic Model - Work with the grantees, expert consultants, and Federal staff to create and refine a logic model of transformation to guide the evaluation.  The logic model will clarify and document both: (a) the definition of transformation standards (i.e., how we will know transformation has been successful), and (b) the theory of change that underlies our efforts (i.e., how we will know transformation is happening as it progresses); (4) Design the Evaluation - Review, select, and develop instruments; create protocols; and specify data analysis plans for the research design.  The evaluation research design must be fully planned, documented, and vetted with Federal staff before data collection begins.  The evaluation design must include: (a) a strategy for determining the effect of transformation on recovery for mental health consumers; (b) a plan for meaningful analysis of NOMS data reported by the State Mental Health Authorities through SAMHSA’s Uniform Reporting System; (c) specifications for how the GPRA Infrastructure Measures specified in the MHT SIG grant announcement (Request for Applications No. SM-05-009, available through www.samhsa.gov) will be operationalized, reported, and incorporated into the data analysis plan; (d) proposals for assessing cost-efficiency of the MHT SIG program; and (e) a process evaluation that documents the most important factors that contribute to, or impede, successful transformation; (5) Prepare OMB Clearance Package:  Prepare, submit, and revise (as necessary) an OMB clearance package that will ensure that the evaluation satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act; (6) Collect and Prepare Data - Oversee State level data collection; collect data independently on-site, as needed; create, manage, and document databases; and ensure the security and integrity of all data; (7) Assist Grantees - Provide training and ongoing technical assistance to grantees in developing State data collection and reporting systems to support all aspects of the evaluation.  Assist grantees in setting targets for, and determining what infrastructure changes will count toward, their GPRA infrastructure measures.   Assist grantees in navigating Internal Review Boards and Informed Consent procedures.  Assist grantees in selecting instruments, designing protocols, and problem-solving their State-specific process and outcome evaluations; (8) Analyze Data and Report Results - Prepare analytic data files; write statistical programs; statistically analyze data; conduct literature searches; write and edit technical reports and related products; develop written and oral presentation materials; respond to a variety of requests for information with quick turnaround times; provide consultation on statistical and analytic methods; and present information about the project to a variety of audiences, both orally and through written materials; and (9) Provide Logistics Support - Provide travel, lodging, and meeting support for site visits, mental health consumers, and expert consultants, as needed.  Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method.  Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted.  The anticipated period of performance is one (1) year with four (4) one-year option periods.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Expressions of Interest for Potential Sites for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF)
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF)


AGENCY: Science and Technology Directorate (Office of Research & Development), DHS.


SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is exploring potential sites for a proposed new national research and development (R&D) asset, the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), which is in the planning phase.  The proposed facility size is approximately 500,000 ft2 and its site will require a minimum of 30 acres.  DHS is requesting Expressions of Interest from federal agencies, State and Local governments, industry, academia, interested parties and organizations for potential locations that would accommodate the construction and operation of the NBAF.  A consortium could be an appropriate respondent.
       DHS will ultimately compile a short list of sites for analysis as reasonable alternatives to be considered in a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which will assess the environmental impacts of constructing and operating the NBAF facility at the various alternative sites. 
       DHS currently expects to publish a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in the fall of 2006, at which time the public will have the opportunity to comment on the scope of the analysis.
DATES: Interested parties wishing to make an Expression of Interest should do so in writing by March 31, 2006 to ensure their consideration. 
ADDRESSES: Please submit Expressions of Interest to: Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane SW, Bldg. 410, Attn: Glynis Fisher, Washington, DC  20528.  For FEDEX, UPS, DHL, etc. deliveries use the mailroom phone number 202-772-9747.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Glynis Fisher by email at glynis.fisher@dhs.gov or by fax to 202-205-3204
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 
       Development of an integrated, national bio and agro-defense strategy has revealed that the current national bio and agro-defense capabilities are inadequate to meet future research requirements supporting both agricultural and public health national security.  Foreign animal disease studies, public health threats from emerging, high-consequence zoonotic pathogens, and the need for development and licensure of medical countermeasures, are generating additional demands for biocontainment laboratory space.  Current laboratory space available in the US is not sufficient to support the increasing levels of research, development, and testing needed to meet the growing concerns about accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases into this country. Additional capability and capacity are also needed for high-consequence zoonotic disease countermeasures research and development and medical countermeasure testing and evaluation.  
Why a New Facility?  The proposed NBAF is an integrated human, foreign animal, and zoonotic disease research, development and testing facility that will support the complementary missions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Human Health and Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  NBAF would provide new research, development, testing and evaluation infrastructure that will allow for research to enhance agricultural and public health. This capability is needed to fill a critical gap in the nations’ agro and biodefense plan.
       The proposed NBAF is envisioned to provide the nation with the first integrated agricultural, zoonotic disease, and public health research, development, testing, and evaluation facility with the capability to address threats from human pathogens, high-consequence zoonotic disease agents, and foreign animal diseases.  The NBAF would enhance the national bio-defense complex by modernizing and integrating agriculture biocontainment laboratories for foreign animal disease, human pathogens, and zoonotic diseases and could require Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 Agricultural and BSL 4 laboratory spaces.  It would also provide the additional infrastructure required for threat and vulnerability assessments and for testing and evaluating promising foreign animal disease countermeasures.  
       Currently, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) provides the only U.S. research and confirmatory diagnostic capability for high-consequence foreign animal diseases.  It is also the only laboratory in the U.S. equipped with research facilities that permit study of these diseases in livestock, such as cattle, sheep and swine.  Recognizing that protecting the agricultural infrastructure is a critical element of our Nation’s homeland security, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the ownership of the PIADC from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the DHS.  While DHS now has responsibility for operating PIADC, both DHS and USDA conduct programs there as part of an integrated agro-defense strategy.   The proposed NBAF would replace the existing PIADC facility and enhance capabilities to meet the mandated national bio and agro-defense mission requirements of DHS, HHS and USDA.
Request for Expression of Interest: DHS requests Expressions of Interest from federal agencies, State and Local governments, industry, academia, interested parties and organizations to identify potential sites with the capabilities needed to host the NBAF facility.  A consortium could be an appropriate respondent.  NBAF is the proposed new facility and is in the planning phase.  All viable options will be evaluated for the location of the facility (i.e., federal government property, federal research property, land deeded to the government, long-term lease, commercial site, etc.).  
       This request for expression of interest, published in today’s Federal Register, is the first step in the process to consider site options for the NBAF.
       DHS will evaluate each EOI submission using 4 site criteria categories (research capabilities, workforce, acquisition/construction/operating and community acceptance) to determine if it should be further evaluated as part of the site planning process.
Research capabilities includes proximity to: (a) existing research programs [medical/veterinary/ agriculture] that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements, (b) strength and breadth of scientific community and infrastructure, (c) ability of the proposed site and surrounding community to absorb additional research programs and infrastructure, (d) experience of existing research programs with BSL3 and/or 4 agents, (e) proximity to other related scientific programs and research infrastructure, and (f) proximity to vaccine industry capability.  
Workforce includes proximity to the following: (a) critical mass of intellectual research capacity, (b) recruiting opportunities for research staff, (c) local labor force availability for operations staff with expertise in operating a biocontainment facility, and (d) capability to meet mutual aid (police/ fire/hospital) requirements to operate facility and be able to meet physical security requirements for a BSL3/4 facility.  
Acquisition/construction/operations includes: (a) land acquisition/development potential to locate the facility, (b) access to the site by highways and proximity to international airports, (c) environmental compatibility with the intended use of the site, (d) adequate utility infrastructure to support operations of facility, and (e) availability of local labor force for construction. 
Community acceptance includes letters of support for locating NBAF at the site (i.e., local and state governments, national and local agricultural producer and commodity stakeholders, industry, academia, etc.).
DHS requires the following information for each proposed NBAF location:
1. A description of your consortium/ organization, its capabilities to support the location of the NBAF at its recommended site, and its interest in the DHS’s NBAF program.
 2. Letters of support for locating the NBAF facility at the site (i.e., local and state government, academia, industry, etc.).
3. A description of how the potential site addressed the four site criteria categories (research capabilities, workforce, and acquisition/ construction/ operating) described above.
4. A map showing the location of the potential site, nearby (within 10 miles) political boundaries, demographics and characteristics of surrounding communities (within 10  miles), historical and cultural resources on site and contiguous to property, roads, railroads, airports, water bodies, parkland or other environmentally sensitive areas, and ecological characteristics of site.
5. A site description including ownership, total site acreage and acreage available for development (minimum 30 acres for NBAF facility); existing physical infrastructure including number of structures, their size, vintage and current use;  current activities; on-site tenants (if applicable); estimated cost as tenant, access control systems; bioagent and hazardous materials handling at the site; waste management activities and capabilities for solid and liquid waste; previous regulatory compliance problems and past/current environmental concerns/contamination and clean up.
6.  Availability/access to utilities (electric, water, steam, chilled water, distilled water) at the site for state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory.
7. Safety and occupational health, risk management and environmental surveillance at the site.
Expression of Interest Format: The length of the Expression of Interest should be no more than 20 pages (letters of support do not count against page limit) using 12-point font.  While the responder may determine how best to use the 20 pages, we recommend the following format: SECTION 1- Summary; SECTION 2- Description of location with specific reference to the 7 items requested by DHS above; SECTION 3- Discussion of the site criteria categories related to state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratories or operations of similar complexity.  When describing similar work that has been performed, include the name of the organization, contract number if applicable, and name and telephone number of the organization’s point of contact and contracting officer, as applicable.   
Proprietary Information: If the Expression of Interest contains information that the submitter believes is privileged or confidential, the appropriate portions of the submission should be marked “Proprietary Information.”  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the respondent.
Submission: Submissions received after the closing date will not be considered.  Each submittal (with full contact information: name, address, phone, fax and email) should consist of an original plus three photocopies, and DHS also requests that the submittal include an electronic version of all materials, preferably in PDF format.  
       DHS will not consider attachments or appendices.  Faxed or emailed submissions will not be accepted. Respondents may submit written questions within 20 business days of this notice being published.  Questions may be submitted by email to glynis.fisher@ dhs.gov or by fax to 202-205-3204.  The responses to frequently asked questions, any other significant questions and any amendments or corrections to the EOI will be posted on the NBAF Planning and Outreach web site at www.dhs.gov/nbaf.
       DHS is under no obligation to pay for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of Expressions of Interest in response to this notice.  DHS reserves the right to respond or not respond to any portion, all, or none of the Expressions of Interest submitted in response to this Notice.  Responders whose submissions are deemed worthy of further consideration given the criteria expressed herein may be asked to provide additional information.  DHS’s further consideration of certain Responders’ Expressions of Interest does not obligate DHS to provide funds to such Responders or to enter into contractual relationships with such Responders.

<DESC>Description This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space, and Hotel Services located in the Washington, DC area. Request for Proposal 777-06-H504 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor. Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.) This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-06, effective October 31, 2005, and VAAR 97-10. NAICS Code 721110 and the small business size standard is $6 million. This BOS announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued. The Period of Performance for this requirement is May 14-18, 2006 (approximately 330 sleeping room nights and required meeting space). Department of Veterans Affairs, Employee Education System (EES) is sponsoring a training conference on the topic of Patient Safety Improvement. The hotel must accommodate approximately 330 sleeping room nights (based on the timeframe), must provide all requirements specified for conference needs in Parts A, B, C and D below, and must provide lodging rates within the stated Government per diem. A separate written solicitation document will not be issued. A response to requirements listed below shall be submitted on letterhead and must address all requirements listed in a separate technical proposal. A hotel contract shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel, e.g., parking, shuttle services, transportation to/from airport, and menus. To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the offeror must propose for use a facility that is compliant with the requirements of the Hotel and Motel fire Safety act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391)(15 U.S.C. 2201 et. seq.) and is listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm. Offers proposing facilities that are not listed will be rejected as non-responsive.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Vis-NIR camera must have a minimum focal plane array (FPA) resolution of 320 x 256 pixels with 30 micron pixel size. Camera systems with lower resolution are unacceptable. Due to object dimensions, spatial resolution, and distance to object requirements, an array format of no less than 320 x 256 with a 30 micron pixel pitch is required.  Arrays with less resolution will limit our ability to capture full spatial and spectral coverage from our spectrograph. B.)	The Vis-NIR camera system must have on-chip gain select for selectable low gain and high gain states. This will allow the operator to fine tune the FPA gain state and sensitivity. Vis-NIR responsivity must provide a difference factor of 21. C.)	The Vis-NIR camera system must include an extended integration time range. The user defined integration time must be selectable from 1 microsecond to Full Frame seconds in increments of 1 microsecond or less. This variable integration is required to fulfill the needs of this application. Vis-NIR camera systems with fixed or preset integration times are unacceptable. D.)

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center research facility of the National Institutes of Health serves the patient care and clinical research needs of the NIH intramural research program.  Its mission is to provide patient care services, training, and the environment in which NIH clinician-scientists creatively translate emerging knowledge into better understanding, detection, treatment, and prevention of human diseases.  On an annual basis, the Clinical Center admits approximately 7,000 patients and supports over 100,000 outpatient visits.  Patients seen at the Clinical Center come from all over the world to participate in research protocols aimed at developing new knowledge of disease processes, new treatments, and expanded comprehension of basic biologic systems.

The office of Financial Resources Management (OFRM), CC provides efficient and effective financial management of programs that fully support the CC and the NIH in meeting its goals and objectives.  OFRM is responsible for managing all of the CC financial operations to include: developing and monitoring the annual hospital operating budget; identifying Institute cost and volume utilization information; developing impact assessments for new protocols and initiatives; performing financial and workload audit and control functions; defining business requirements for new clinical information systems and supporting modules that document and monitor patient care; and developing presentation and support materials for various NIH and hospital governing bodies.  The strategic goal and the continuation of the goal is that the CC/OFRM began the design and development of a hospital Executive Information System (EIS) to allow participating NIH Institutes the ability to quickly access and analyze information across a broad range of hospital functions.

The initial phase of the EIS initiative was to develop patient census dashboards for hospital and IC leadership.  Each dashboard contains hospital patient statistics including inpatient and outpatient census, admissions, average daily census, etc.  This phase of the initiative was achieved in January 2004.  Simultaneously a continuation of the development started in the creation of a hospital executive dashboard with key organizational performance indicator which was implemented in April, 2004. The completion of this pilot dashboard primarily focused on maintaining and the current system and dashboards, with some additional evaluation to include clinical service metrics.

The next phase of EIS work is slated to begin in February, 2006.  This phase will include much-needed enhancements to the existing system architecture and database machines; development and inclusion of new data elements for ad-hoc reporting; further definition and project expansion planning; and training users.

Task Order Title: Conduct a Capability Assessment and Gap Analysis for the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC).   2. Intent:  The overall intent is to improve the command's End-to-End surface deployment and distribution operations through a detailed understanding of the requirements across the full spectrum of operations in a structured manner to ensure the best appli cation of resources towards solving Command issues.   To identify capability gaps within the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, to determine the attributes of a capability or combination of capabilities that would resolve the gaps, ident ify materiel and/or non-materiel approaches for implementation and roughly assess the cost and operational effectiveness of the changes.   3. Purpose:  The purpose of this analysis is to support rigorous assessment and analysis of capability gaps through a Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) process in order to reach appropriate materiel and non-materiel solutions as part of this command's po rtion of the broader DOD Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) effort.  As the basis for performing this assessment and analysis, this process will suggest a set of capabilities and corresponding tasks, conditions and standards that  will potentially guide how this command will support a future joint force commander with an integrated joint distribution activity.  In addition, this process is intended to help drive the command's participation in experimentation, and to influence scien ce and technology efforts.   4. Scope:   This analysis will assess SDDC's future requirements for surface end-to-end, joint deployment and distribution operations.  It will address how SDDC can enhance - rather than limit - the conduct of operations across the full range of military operations in  the period 2015-2025.   SDDC's operations directly provide for the movement and sustainment of joint forces -collectively, these operations promote the rapid and effective employment of these forces.  The span of operations encompasses all movement activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including intracontinental United States, inter-theater, theater reception, intertheater movement legs, and assembly areas.   SDDC future joint operations will particularly focus on the challenges of rapidly  and effectively integrating deployment and distribution capabilities during the early stages of a major combat operation.  During the seize the initiative portion of a major combat operation SDDC's support to the joint force commander must provide for the  rapid closure, reposition, maneuver, and employ joint forces, it must also be prepared for immediate integration of follow-on sustainment of personnel, equipment, and supplies, and the reconstitution of these forces to re-engage the fight within the joint  operations area (JOA) or elsewhere.  SDDC's operations must be planned, integrated, and executed across the strategic, operational, and tactical continuum - this end-to-end perspective is also part of this analysis.   The bottom line, SDDC's deployment and distribution function covers all movement activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including intracontinental United States, inter-theater, theater reception, intratheater movement legs , and assembly areas for forces and material.  The logistic principles most critical to a successful deployment and distribution enterprise are: responsiveness, flexibility, sustainability, survivability, and simplicity.  These principles should be used as a lens in which to examine the capabilities-ba sed assessments: Responsiveness.  Responsiveness is the right support in the right place at the right time.  Among the logistics principles, responsiveness is the keystone.  All other principles become irrelevant if logistics support does not support the commander's concep t of operations.  Responsiveness is achieved by the enterprise if it can close, maneuver, reposition, sustain, and reconstitute joint forces with a degree of rapidity, precision, and control to meet joint force commander requirements.  Responsiveness of th e supply chain must be measured from the customer's perspective.  In major combat operations, distribution responsiveness is most difficult to achieve during the seize-the-initiative portion of a joint campaign when the joint force commander may be require d to conduct simultaneous, distributed, non-linear, and non-contiguous combat operations at the same time he is closing and sustaining the rest of his force.  In the future, the responsiveness and operational reach of inter/intra theater mobility platforms  will be measured in hours and days, not weeks and months.  In order to meet responsiveness requirements of the follow-on decisive-operations portion of the campaign, the enterprise will be required to source and project standing, scalable, and expeditiona ry theater distribution capabilities to the Joint Force Commander. Flexibility.  Flexibility is the ability to adapt logistics structures and procedures to changing situations, missions, and concepts of operation.  The ability to rapidly reposition or operationally maneuver joint forces is an example of the type of flexib ility that the enterprise must possess to support fluid joint operations.  The principle of flexibility also includes the concepts of alternative planning (e.g., branches and sequels), anticipation, reserve assets, redundancy, and centralized control and d ecentralized execution.  Deployment/distribution plans and operations must be flexible to achieve both responsiveness and survivability.  Flexibility will not be realized if the enterprise does not have near real-time visibility of customer requirements an d support flowing to the customer.  Deployment and distribution-related decision-support tools need to possess the ability to perform time-sensitive course of action, supportability, and risk assessment analyses in order to properly plan and react to chang ing missions and concepts of operation. Sustainability.  Sustainability is the ability to maintain logistics support to all users throughout the area of operations for the duration of the operation.  Lean supply chains will characterize future operations, placing critical importance on precise t ime-definit e delivery of equipment and supplies to joint forces throughout the battle space.  This principle poses the greatest challenge to the distribution enterprise since future forces will likely be highly distributed across greater distances with lines of commu nication that must connect nonlinear and noncontiguous joint operating areas.  A deployment and distribution enterprise that is not fully networked with the customer and the supplier will not be able to see operational requirements in near real-time and wi ll not be able to generate pipeline support, or manipulate the pipeline to adapt to changing operational priorities. Survivability.  Survivability is the capacity of the organization to protect its forces and resources.  Distribution and other logistic units and installations are high-value targets that must be guarded to avoid presenting the enemy with a critical vulner ability.  Survivability requirements present particular challenges to the enterprise in its mission to provide responsive and sustained distribution support to dispersed joint forces.  Requirements for the protection of enterprise personnel, mobility asset s, terminals, nodes (afloat and ashore), command and control centers, information, and lines of communication must be factored into the overall concept for logistics support for the joint force.  Force protection considerations will likely force the enterp rise to continuously adjust route allocation, carrier selection, and scheduling activities, necessitating a robust set of decision-support tools and models to aid in planning and execution.  The enterprise must also effectively address the protection of di stribution capabilities sourced from commercial, nongovernmental sources. Simplicity.  Simplicity fosters efficiency in both planning and execution of logistic operations.  Commander's intent, mission-type orders, and standard rules, tools, and procedures contribute to simplicity.  Simplified procedures for establishing movement  and issue priorities will greatly enhance joint distribution operations. The attributes that are used must be testable or measurable characteristics that describe an aspect of a system or capability.  The attributes listed below best describe the critical characteristics required of an effective and efficient surface deployment  and distribution enterprise - collectively they serve as a basis for the development of standards that are explicitly linked to mission-essential tasks and supporting tasks. Capacity.  Capacity is defined by the physical quantity, size, mix, configuration, and readiness of its assets and infrastructure.  Capacity is not a static attribute; it includes the flexibility to expand or contract enterprise elements in response to dyn amic mission and requirements changes. Visibility.  Visibility is the capability to determine the status, location, and direction of flow for all forces, requirements and materiel.  Surface end-to-end visibility is required over operational capabilities and capability packages, organizations, p eople and things moving through the pipeline.  It also includes the organic military mobility forces and commercial augmentation that move people and things through the pipeline, the financial transactions that support them, and the nodes and links compris ing the pipeline.  Visibility requires the availability of timely, accurate, and usable information essential to the maintenance of a common operating picture within the overall distribution enterprise information network. Reliability.  Reliability is the degree of assurance or dependability that consistently meet its support requirements to specified standards.  Reliability instills trust and confidence of the customer in the certainty that the enterprise will meet warfight er demands under clearly established and recognized conditions. Velocity.  Velocity is the speed at which requirements are fulfilled. Rapidity is only one aspect of velocity.  Requirements must be fulfille d at the right speed.  This means that synchronization of the speeds of the various aspects of the distribution process is required in order to maximize effectiveness.  Velocity also incorporates the ability of elements to forecast, anticipate, and plan di stribution execution.  Sufficient velocity meets performance expectations and satisfies mission requirements when and where required by the supported commander's concept of operations. Precision.  Precision within the analysis, means the accuracy with which delivery of forces, requirements, and materiel occurs at the right time, the right place, and the right amount.  Precision also addresses the ability to minimize deviation from accept able standards as it reacts to dynamically changing conditions and requirements. 5. Specific Tasks for the Capability Assessment and Gap Analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to provide the necessary insight into where this command faces the greatest operational risk regarding our surface deployment and distribution missions.  The Capability Assessment and Gap Analysis when completed will serve t o manage the command's investments in technologies, programs, and product support necessary to achieve our surface deployment and distribution missions as part of the National Security Strategy which supports our armed forces. In that context, our continue d objective is to rapidly acquire quality products that satisfy user needs with measurable improvements to mission capability at a fair and reasonable price.  The analysis will focus on the command's operational functions such as but not limited to termina l operations, container management, securing commercial transportation services, movement control. The focus areas are the following:  The ability to conduct joint surface deployment and distribution enterprise force development is an inherent capability of the enterprise.  Critical is the authority to determine joint distribution enterprise requirements across the DOTMLPF spectrum for a ctivities such as the ability to determine the requirements for inter and intra-theater lift platforms.  The ability to build and enforce a single, multiechelon, and prioritization system is a key enabler to the rapid, agile, and accurate delivery of material.  A key aspect is the ability for each echelon to set priorities for units and areas under their ope rational control.  This capability would allow the distribution system to automatically discern JFC operational requirements/priorities or changes route/re-route critical commodities directly to the most critical units.  The ability to rapidly establish a C2 system that can identify, locate, communicate, and perform planning and execution activities in a real-time, collaborative, network environment complete with COP, TAV, ITV, decision support tools and modeling and simu lation across all elements of the joint interagency multinational force up to and including the secret level.  The ability to configure and deploy scalable, modular joint forces from strategic and operational distances requiring minimum or all together eliminating JRSOI activities on arrival.  The ability to move forces from strategic and operational distances in a single move, as required, to JFC designated locations.  The ability to conduct arrival and assembly, and joint distribution operations in an expeditionary and maneuverable, or antiaccess environment aboard.  The ability to rapidly organize, track, shift, and potentially reconfigure forces and support, even en route, that are modular, tailorable and delivered directly to JFC designated points of need.  This capability should be accomplished without repackaging  and be aboard multimodal means to prevent operational pauses in theater.  The ability to develop and maintain standing, scalable, and modular distribution support packages (leadership, trained personnel, communication and reach-back) to deploy with the same rapidity as operational forces.  The ab ility to locate, move, track, and retrograde sufficient quantities of sustainment to prevent any operational pauses in theater.  The ability to rapidly reconstitute the force and re-deploy joint forces and sustainment to an alternate theater or points of origin.  The ability to direct/redirect scarce commodities in the joint distribution pipeline to satisfy the most current operational requirements established by the JFC with financial system support focused on the dynamic priorities of JFC units, rather than the Service of origin.  The ability to plan and execute rapid medical evacuations and force extractions with agility and precision.  The ability to apply high-speed intratheater connector lift to rapidly distribute forces and sustainment in a highly distributed environment. 6.1 Develop a Capability Assessment and Gap Analysis Plan, which Supports the Command's Operational Missions:  The contractor will develop and present a deliberate strategy to research and analyze SDDC's ability to most effectively support our dynamic Nati onal Security Policy using the principals and attributes previously mentioned.    6.2 Execute the Capability Assessment and Gap Analysis Plan (from Task # 6.1) which Supports the Command's Operational Missions:  The contractor will execute and document the approved plan outlined in Task # 6.1. 6.3 Administrative Support for the Capability Assessment and Gap Analysis: The contractor will aid in the preparation, documentation, and presentation to internal SDDC decision-making bodies (Command Group, appropriate Staff Principals, Senior Management T eam, etc.) and to external agencies on the analysis conducted under this statement of work.

2.	TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS AND EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
Proposals will be evaluated in terms of quality, depth and relevance of information presented in response to this Statement of Work.

	A. Factor 1: Technical Understanding of Requirements, Methodology Deliverables and Delivery Schedule: 

1. Offerors shall specifically address all of the elements listed in the following:

			a) Technical and qualitative descriptions of the proposed methodology that will be used to accomplish the objectives in this statement of work.
			b) Detailed labor mix and project plan that will meet the deliverables and delivery schedule that is defined in this statement of work.

		2. Basis of Evaluation: Offers will be evaluated to determine the extent of soundness of the proposed approach, its suitability to this effort, and the ability of the offeror to deliver within the required timeframes.

	B. Factor 2: Professional Qualifications: 

1. Offerors shall submit a statement of qualifications outlining their firm’s 
capabilities and experience with respect to the effort described herein. The statement of qualifications should describe the personnel and their experience that are directly relevant to this effort. Resumes of proposed personnel shall be submitted with the proposal. Professional staff resumes are not included in the 25-page limitation, but are themselves limited to 3 pages.

		2. Basis of Evaluation: The resumes submitted by the offeror will be evaluated to assess the availability and qualifications of the proposed staff, their experience in similar projects and their capability to fully and professionally accomplish the objectives stated herein. 
	
C. Factor 3: Past Performance: 

1. Offerors must submit descriptions of projects similar in scope, size and
complexity performed during the past three years, including references. Sufficient information should be provided to allow the Government to contact the agencies/organizations served and assess the quality of the services provided.

	D. Factor 4: Price: Not objectively rated, but considered for reasonableness in the best value determination
    
3.	ADJECTIVAL RATING AND STANDARDS SCALE
Each proposal will be rated based on evaluation of each factor using the following Adjectival Rating and Standards Scale:

OUTSTANDING – Very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear response. Proposal consistently meets this standard with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.

EXCELLENT – Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality, but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.

GOOD – No deficiencies in the response. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

FAIR – The response generally meets requirements but there is not expectation of better than acceptable performance. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

POOR – The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revisions to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.

UNACCEPTABLE – Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

4.	BEST VALUE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY:

Best value evaluations is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solution that provides the optimal results to the Government, price and other factors considered, Subjectivity is inherent in the process and is the cornerstone of the source selection decision. In an effort to provide insight to the offerors as to the decision making process of the Government, the following information is provided:

Evaluation will be made on two factors – Technical and Price. In the evaluation, technical is significantly more important than price. While price is not as important as Technical, it does have significance to the Government.

In rating the technical proposals, the three factors (Technical Understanding, Professional Qualifications, and Past Performance) are listed in descending order of importance. Technical Understanding is moderately more important than the other two factors combined while Professional Qualifications is slightly more important then Past Performance/Corporate Experience.

Your firm’s submission should reflect and demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered. Resumes and qualifications of proposed personnel shall also be provided. Your submission should reflect the quality and experience of proposed personnel at competitive fixed prices. The technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages in length and single sided. The technical proposal shall include labor mix and hours, but not labor rates. During the technical evaluation, the labor mix and hours, not labor rates, will be evaluated. Price submissions shall be under separate cover and competitive firm fixed priced. Other Direct Costs proposed shall be realistic to the extent that all costs/prices can be fully supported. Resumes, and past performance do not count towards the page limitation. Email is the preferred method of submission.


Statement of Work: UNIX Server Purchase	


5.  GENERAL REQUIREMEMTS  

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Work will be performed at the Human Resource Domain Division, 2521 South Clark Street, Suite 3000, Arlington, VA 22202 also known as the Polk Building.

SECURITY: U.S. Citizenship is required for all contractor personnel working on-site. 
In addition, contractor employees who are working in WHS/ITMD offices may be required to sign a non-disclosure statement for accessing certain restricted data.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: All contractors assigned to this contract shall have at a minimum a favorable National Agency Check (NAC) investigation that would support a SECRET security clearance. It will be the contractor’s responsibility to assure contract employees have the appropriate investigations, are trained in proper security practices, and follow appropriate security directives and procedures.  Contract employees who work on this contract must be knowledgeable and where appropriate follow the Department of Defense procedures to clear information for public release through the Department of Defense Office of Freedom of Information and Security Review.   

6. BACKGROUND
WHS/ITMD currently has two Hewlett-Packard servers.  One is a production server and the other is a development server.  These servers have reached their end of life cycle and need to be replaced.  

Production Database Server

The production environment consists of one HP 9000 N400 (N Class) server primarily running HP-UX 11.0 with Oracle 8.1.7 databases that support a variety of custom applications as well as COTS products such as RESUMIX, Business Objects, and TrackIt.

Hardware Platform:  The current server configuration for the N Class server is as follows: two 36 GB internal disks, eight 36 GB Surestore disks, DVD ROM, two Single Port Ultra 2 SCSI HBA’s, three 800 MHz processors, 4 GB of RAM, one 100Base-T LAN adapter, one DDS3 DAT tape drive, rack mounted HP PowerTrust II-MR 4 kW (4.5 kVA) UPS 240v, which are installed in two HP9000 Standard Rack System E41.  The current operating system installed on the server is HP-UX 11.0 with an unlimited user’s license and is not clustered.  

Software Platform:
The HP-UX development environment consists of Oracle 8.1.7 and 9.x.  Backups are performed by CommVault Galaxy version 5.9.0.

Current Usage:  200 GBs of local storage to support the databases with an anticipated increase next year of 400 GBs.  Furthermore, the government anticipates a growth rate of 15 percent per year after FY07.  There four Oracle database instances which serve 36 concurrent users.  On average there are 100 sessions active at any given time with a peak of 200.   

Development Database Server

The development environment mirrors the production environment as stated above.

Production Web Server

Hardware:  The production web server is a Sun Fire 280R that has two 900 MHz processors, 4 GBs RAM, and two 72 GB internal hard drives.  It is running SUN Solaris 8.0.

Software:  Apache 1.3.31, Oracle Client 9.2, CommVault Galaxy version 5.9 (client), OpenSSL 0.9.7i, OpenSSH 4.2p1, mod_perl 1.0, mod_ssl 2.8.25 and later.
 
Current Usage:  60 GB of disk space is currently being consumed.  This server houses a publicly accessible web site that receives approximately 25 K hits per day.  The present server meets the current usage requirement.  However, the government anticipates a 10 % increase each year after FY07.

7.	REQUIREMENTS
WHS/ITMD requires contractor support to design, procure, install, configure, test, and deploy a replacement for the current environment.  The government requires a new production database environment consisting of two servers that will provide redundant pathways to a shared storage array.  Furthermore, complete failover capability from one server to another is required in the event the primary is not available.  The SUN Solaris and Veritas platforms are utilized in the current WHS enterprise architecture. Therefore, it is required that the proposed solution adhere to this architecture.  
The government requires two additional servers.  One server is for development and the other is for test and evaluation, both are to match the production database server configuration.  These servers do not require clustering.
The government requires a replacement for the web server.

<DESC>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS I

Below you will find a list of questions and answers related to this solicitation.  If you have any additional questions or concerns please contat Kimberly N. Keith regarding this solicitation at 919-541-4474 or Keith.Kimberly@epa.gov.    


1:  Who would support the OAS server? Will the EPA do it or would it be a Silver Star responsibility?

The maintenance provider is to have experience working with OAS server and the Visual Messenger application that is loaded on it, as well as how it operates with the Octel 350.   The provider should keep us abreast of any additional patches that may be needed to insure optimum performance.  EPA, maintains the OAS server hardware and operating system.  

2:  Does this system have redundant processors?
The Octel's server drives (not CPU) are redundant  for software files, subscriber database, as well as voice and fax messages.  Global Message Redundancy (GMR) is active on the Octel.

3:  Does the EPA want the system to be monitored remotely?
Some diagnostics may be performed remotely via typically using the RDAC.   We expect that all hardware issues require an onsite visit.   We have a Gordon Kapes model 125 that monitors environmental conditions and provides password protected modem access.   

This answer is dependent on the extent of the monitoring in question and would additional monitoring equipment be necessary. 

4:  Who is the Incumbent?
Nextiraone Federal LLC

5:   What is the address of the facility that the Octel VM system is located at?
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
109 TW Alexander Drive

The number of containers can increase up to 7 or 8 per week depending on the activity in the barn facility; therefore, the contractor must be able to provide up to 7 or 8 containers weekly on a continual basis to meet the influx of animals in the barn during the busy months. This increased activity will probably occur from December – February. The facility will call 24 hours in advance for pickup of the containers and the contractor must have the capacity to pickup the containers with a 24 hour notice. We anticipate approximately two (2) 20 yard container pickups per week, however, this could increase to daily pickups during the busy months as indicated above.

All pickups need to include a service ticket, and one of the USDA, APHIS,VS, Miami Import/Export Center personnel or the security guard must sign for receipt of delivery on the service ticket prior to the contractor pickup personnel departing the facility.
